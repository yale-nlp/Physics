In addition to a photo-emission cathode, it has several dynodes which are maintained at successively higher potentials (see Fig. 3.13).

The potential difference accelerates the electrons so that when they strike the surface of a dynode, each causes three or four secondary electrons to be ejected. These secondary electrons are then accelerated towards the next dynode and the process is repeated. In this manner, a single electron at the cathode can be multiplied to one million electrons at the anode after ten stages.\n\nThe resultant anode current, $I$, which is proportional to the mean number $\\overline{N}$ of the electrons collected, is on average proportional to the energy $E$ of the incoming photon.

A telescope system uses a converging or a diverging lens as the eyepiece.
