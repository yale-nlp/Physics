As the temperature is lowered, it becomes a liquid solid (more gas converts to liquid); it is found that 25,400 J of heat must be removed to liquify one mole of ammonia. The cylinder is then cooled to 180K, at which point the cylinder contains some solid ammonia but no liquid, and the pressure is measured to be 8.8 mm of Hg. As the temperature is lowered it is found that more gas converts to solid, and that 31,200 J must be removed to convert one mole of gas to solid.

This is the familiar _n_ balls in _N_ compartments question, which we can state in terms of balls and dividers (à la Schroeder). We need _N - 1_ to dividers to divide out _N_ partitions on a straight line and _n_ balls to place in them. We line them up starting with the balls in the first compartment, followed by a vertical divider and so on. We have _n + N - 1_ total symbols (balls and dividers). The number of possible arrangements is the number of ways we can choose _n_ of these symbols to be balls: $ \\binom{n+N-1}{n} $. We are told to say _N - 1 ≈ N_. So, using Stirling,  \n\n$$\nσ ≈ N \\left( \\left(1 + \\frac{n}{N}\\right) \\log \\left(1 + \\frac{n}{N}\\right) - \\frac{n}{N} \\log \\frac{n}{N} \\right).\n$$\n\n(14.2.2)\n\n**Method 2**:  \nWe can also view this problem as counting the number of ways of writing some non-negative integer, _n_, as the sum of _N_ ordered non-negative integers.

Thus, the coefficient of $x^n$, which we have called _g(N, n)_ is precisely the number of ways of writing _n_ as the sum of _N_ ordered non-negative integers.
