The key point here involves understanding the effect of nuclear spin on the degeneracy of rotational energy levels.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### 1. Nuclear Spin Consideration:\nEach nitrogen atom (\\( ^{14}\\text{N} \\)) has a nuclear spin quantum number \\( I = 1 \\), which means each nucleus can have three possible orientations along any given axis due to its magnetic moment. These states correspond to projections \\( m_I = -1, 0, +1 \\).\n\nFor two identical nuclei with spin \\( I = 1 \\):\n\\[ |m_{I1}| = -1, 0, +1 \\]\n\\[ |m_{I2}| = -1, 0, +1 \\]\n\nThe total nuclear angular momentum projection \\( M_J \\) for the system will be determined by combining these individual contributions.\n\n#### 2. Total Angular Momentum Quantum Number J:\nIn a homonuclear diatomic molecule such as \\( N_2^{14} \\), the electronic state typically does not contribute additional complexity since it usually remains symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange symmetry. Therefore, focusing solely on nuclear spins, the total angular momentum quantum number \\( F \\) combines both electron orbital angular momentum \\( L \\) and nuclear spin \\( S \\):\n\nSince there’s no net electronic contribution,\n\\[ F = I_1 + I_2 \\]\n\nGiven \\( I_1 = I_2 = 1 \\),\nthe allowed values of \\( F \\) range from \\(|I_1-I_2|\\) to \\(I_1+I_2\\).\nThus,\n\\[ F = 0, 1, 2 \\]\n\nHowever, because \\( N_2^{14} \\) consists of indistinguishable particles, only even values of \\( F \\) are physically realizable.\nSo,\n\\[ F = 0, 2 \\]\n\n#### 3. Rotational Energy Levels Degeneracies:\nRotational transitions occur between different rotational quantum numbers \\( J \\). For a rigid rotor model, the energy level spacing depends on \\( B(J) \\propto h^2 / {8π²μr₀²} \\cdot J(J+1) \\).\n\nWhen considering nuclear hyperfine structure, the effective splitting occurs based on the interaction between nuclear spins and molecular rotation.

Intensity Ratio Calculation:\nIntensity ratios relate directly to population differences among accessible states during transition processes. Given equal probability distribution across available states,\n\nAt higher \\( J \\) values, more populated \\( F=2 \\) contributes significantly compared to less-populated single-state \\( F=0 \\).\n\nHence, intensity ratio follows combinatorial factors reflecting underlying symmetries and conservation laws governing transitions.\n\nConclusively, the observed pattern emerges showing twice as many contributing pathways via \\( F=2 \\) than those involving \\( F=0 \\),\n\nThus yielding the desired ratio:\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{Intensities}}{} : 2:1 \\]\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2:1}\n\\]"}

{"id": "quantum/6009", "questions": "The nucleus $ ^8 \\text{Be} $ is unstable with respect to dissociation into two $ \\alpha $ particles, but experiments on nuclear reactions characterize the two lowest unstable levels as $ J = 0$, even parity, $\\sim 95$ $keV$ above the dissociation level,\nand $ J = 2$, even parity, $\\sim 3$ $MeV$ above the dissociation level.\n\nConsider how the existence of these levels influences the scattering of $ \\alpha $ particles from helium gas, specifically:\n\n(a) Write the wave function for elastic scattering, in its partial wave expansion, for $ r \\rightarrow \\infty $.\n\n(b) Describe qualitatively how the relevant phase shifts vary as functions of energy in the proximity of each level.\n\n(c) Describe how this variation affects the angular distribution of $\\alpha$ particles.", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "To address your question about the influence of the excited states of \\(^8\\text{Be}\\) on the scattering of alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)) particles from helium gas, we will go through parts (a), (b), and (c).\n\n### Part (a): Wave Function for Elastic Scattering\n\nFor elastic scattering processes involving a central potential, the total wavefunction can be expanded using spherical Bessel functions and Legendre polynomials:\n\\[ \n\\Psi(r,\\theta)=e^{ikr} + f(k)\\frac{e^{ikr}}{kr}\n\\]\nwhere \\(f(k)\\) is the scattering amplitude which depends on the incident momentum \\(k\\) and the angle between the initial direction and the scattered particle's direction.\n\nIn terms of partial waves, the asymptotic form of the radial part of the wavefunction for large distances \\(r \\to \\infty\\) is given by:\n\\[\nR_l(r) \\approx A_l j_l(kr) - iB_l n_l(kr)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(j_l(x)\\) and \\(n_l(x)\\) represent the spherical Bessel functions of first kind and second kind respectively, while \\(A_l\\) and \\(B_l\\) depend on boundary conditions including any resonances or bound state effects.\n\nUsing the relation between coefficients and phase shift \\(\\delta_l\\):\n\\[\n\\tan{\\delta_l}=i\\left(1+\\frac{i}{ka_0(l)}\\right)^{-l-1/2},\n\\]\nwe get the general expression for the wavefunction incorporating all partial waves:\n\\[\nu_{E}(r) = R_E(r)r=\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty u_l(r),\n\\]\nwith individual contributions being:\n\\[\nu_l(r) = C_l [h_l^{+}(kr)e^{-i\\delta_l}- h_l^{-}(kr)],\n\\]\nwhere \\(C_l\\) are constants determined by normalization and continuity requirements across different regions.\n\nThus, combining everything together, the full wavefunction for elastic scattering becomes:\n\\[\n\\Psi(r,\\theta) = e^{ikr} + \\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\sqrt{\\frac{(4\\pi)(2l+1)}{k}} P_l(\\cos\\theta) \\sin(\\delta_l) e^{il\\phi}.\n\\]\n\n### Part (b): Phase Shifts Near Resonance Levels\n\nNear resonance energies corresponding to the excitation levels of \\(J=0\\) around 95 keV and \\(J=2\\) near 3 MeV, significant changes occur due to coupling with those discrete states. The phase shifts \\(\\delta_l(E)\\) exhibit characteristic behavior close to such thresholds:\n\n- **\\(J=0\\) Level**: For low-energy excitations just above 95 keV, there should be a sharp increase in the s-wave (l=0) phase shift because it corresponds directly to the formation probability of that particular excited state.\n  \n- **\\(J=2\\) Level**: Similarly, when approaching the higher threshold (~3 MeV), d-waves (l=2) would show pronounced variations reflecting enhanced interaction probabilities associated with populating the \\(J=2\\) state.\n\nThese behaviors indicate peaks or discontinuous jumps in respective phase shifts indicating strong interference patterns indicative of quasi-bound states.\n\n### Part (c): Angular Distribution Effects\n\nGiven the modified phase shifts described earlier, the differential cross-section for scattering angles \\(\\theta\\) gets influenced significantly:\n\nDifferential Cross Section formula:\n\\[\nd\\sigma/d\\Omega = |f(\\theta)|^2 = |\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty (2l+1)i^lj_l(kr)[P_l(\\cos\\theta)]|^2\n\\]\n\nWith substantial modifications occurring particularly within specific ranges where l-values align closely with dominant contributing phaseshifts:\n\n- At lower energies closer to ~95 KeV: Expect prominent forward-backward asymmetry driven mainly by s-wave components leading potentially towards more collimated beam-like distributions post-scatter.\n   \n- Around ~3 MeV region: Higher-order multipole interactions become important introducing complex oscillatory structures possibly yielding broader spread over various solid angles depending upon relative strengths among multiple interfering channels.\n\nTherefore, overall impact results in distinctively altered angular dependence compared purely non-resonant scenarios highlighting presence of underlying quantum mechanical structure inherent to system under study.\n\nFinal Answer Boxed Format:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n    \\begin{aligned}\n        &\\textbf{(a)}& \\Psi(r,\\theta)&=e^{ikr} + \\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\sqrt{\\frac{(4\\pi)(2l+1)}{k}} P_l(\\cos\\theta) \\sin(\\delta_l) e^{il\\phi}, \\\\\n        &\\textbf{(b)}& \\delta_l(E) && \\text{show sharp increases near } E \\approx 95~\\mathrm{KeV} \\text{ and } E \\approx 3~\\mathrm{MeV}.\\\\\n        &\\textbf{(c)}& d\\sigma/d\\Omega &=|\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty (2l+1)i^lj_l(kr)[P_l(\\cos\\theta)]|^2; \\quad \\text{Angular dist'n modulated strongly}\\\\\n         &&&& \\text{by phase-shift variations especially noticeable near mentioned energies.}\n    \\end{aligned}}\n\\]"}

This means they can be described using waves called \"wavefunctions\" which give probabilities for finding the electron at different positions.\n\n2. **Periodic Potential Energy Landscape**: In a crystal lattice, atoms or molecules arrange themselves periodically over space. Each atom contributes its own potential field due to its nucleus and surrounding electrons. When you have many atoms arranged regularly (as in a crystal), these individual potentials combine into one large periodic potential landscape across the entire material.\n\n3. **Bloch's Theorem Application**: Bloch’s theorem is crucial here; it states that when dealing with systems having periodic structures (like crystals), solutions to Schrödinger's equation take on special forms known as Bloch functions. These functions describe standing waves whose amplitudes vary sinusoidally through space according to the underlying atomic structure.\n\n4. **Energy Band Formation**: Due to this periodicity and interaction between neighboring atoms' electronic fields:\n   - An isolated single-atom would typically allow only discrete energies corresponding to specific orbitals.\n   - However, once multiple identical atoms come together forming a regular array (crystal):\n     * Their respective orbital levels start overlapping slightly because their outermost shells interact via electromagnetic forces.\n     * As more neighbors contribute similar interactions around each site, what initially were distinct energy levels broaden into continuous ranges—these become our 'bands'.\n   \n5. **Allowed vs Forbidden Energies** (\"Band Gaps\"): Within certain regions along the band range, no allowed state exists where electrons could reside stably without violating conservation laws or other physical constraints imposed by the system symmetry. Such gaps separate adjacent bands creating zones termed “forbidden” or simply ‘gaps’.\n\n6. **Conduction & Valence Bands**: Typically, lower-energy occupied bands near nuclei represent valence bands while higher unoccupied ones further away constitute conduction bands. Whether a substance conducts electricity depends critically upon whether carriers exist above gap thresholds enabling them to move freely under applied electric fields.\n\nIn summary, the formation of energy bands arises naturally from applying principles of quantum mechanics to extended arrays of interacting atoms found in crystalline solids. It explains phenomena ranging from electrical conductivity differences among metals, semiconductors, insulators up to complex behaviors seen in modern nanomaterials.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The existence of energy bands results from the application of quantum mechanics to the periodic arrangement of atoms in a crystal, leading to overlapping of atomic energy levels and creation of allowed and forbidden energy regions.}}\n\\]"}

For hydrogen:\n   - Linear Stark effect occurs because there’s no degeneracy among different sublevels within each principal quantum number level for hydrogen. \n4. **Degenerate Substates**: Since all angular momentum states (\\(\\ell\\) values) corresponding to a given \\(n\\) value have distinct energies even without any applied field, applying an electric field will cause these non-degenerate states to shift differently leading to observable shifts proportional to the strength of the electric field.\n\nThus, for hydrogen:\n\n\\[ E(n,\\ell,m_\\ell; F) = E_0 + C_F |F| + O(F^2), \\]\n\nwhere \\(E_0\\) represents the unperturbed energy, \\(C_F\\) is some constant depending on the specific transition involved, and \\(O(F^2)\\) denotes terms involving second-order effects or higher.\n\n### Sodium Atom\n\nFor sodium, things get more complex due to multiple electrons interacting with each other as well as with the nucleus.\n\n1. **Electron Configuration**: Sodium has 11 electrons arranged such that they fill up shells according to Pauli exclusion principle rules: [Ne]3s¹.\n2. **Excited State Considerations**:\n    - Higher-energy transitions involve exciting valence electrons from lower-lying s-states to p-, d-, etc.-type states.\n    - These transitions often result in partially filled outermost shell(s).\n3. **Quadratic Stark Effect Origin**:\n    - Due to strong inter-electronic repulsion forces present especially near core regions where many inner-shell electrons reside, perturbative corrections become significant beyond first order.\n    - This leads to mixing between otherwise nearly degenerate states under application of weak electric fields causing predominantly quadratically dependent changes rather than simple linear ones observed initially.\n\nTherefore, for sodium-like systems experiencing small electric fields,\n\n\\[ E(Na_{exc}, F) = E_0 + D_F F^2 + ... , \\]\n   \nwith negligible contributions coming directly from purely linear components compared to those arising through interactions affecting squared term coefficients significantly.\n\nIn summary,\nHydrogen shows primarily *linear* Stark behavior since individual orbital energies remain sufficiently separated allowing straightforward linear response interpretation whereas Sodium exhibits mainly *quadratically-dependent* responses owing largely to intricate multi-particle dynamics complicating direct proportionality assumptions about initial excitation impacts.\n\nThe key difference lies fundamentally in their differing degrees of internal complexity regarding both nuclear charge distribution influence over surrounding bound-state wavefunctions plus mutual couplings amongst constituent particles themselves!\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Atomic hydrogen displays a linear Stark effect while atomic sodium demonstrates a predominately quadratic Stark effect due to differences in their respective electronic structures and resultant interaction complexities under applied electrostatic conditions.}}\n\\]"}

In particular, the first Born approximation neglects these interference effects leading to incorrect predictions regarding both real and imaginary parts of the scattering amplitudes. Therefore, while the first Born approximation may give reasonable estimates under certain conditions, it generally violates the optical theorem due to its inability to account fully for all contributions to the scattering matrix elements.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nDue to ignoring higher-order corrections and interferences among different partial waves, the first Born approximation typically leads to violations of the optical theorem.\n\n### (d) Proton Electric Quadrupole Moment\n\nA nucleon like the proton has no intrinsic shape deformation sufficient enough to produce a measurable static electric quadrupole moment. Since protons are point-like fermions within their own rest frame according to current understanding based on QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics), they do not possess any permanent multipolar moments beyond monopoles such as charge itself. Any observed non-zero values would likely arise from dynamic processes rather than inherent structure.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nProtons lack a detectable electric quadrupole moment since they behave essentially spherically symmetrically without internal deformations contributing significant multipoles other than charge distribution.\n\n### (e) Phase Shift Sign for Weak Short-Range Attractive Potential Scattering\n\nFor a weakly interacting attractive potential, the effective interaction tends to delay the outgoing scattered wave relative to free propagation. Thus, the phase shift introduced will predominantly be negative indicating a retardation effect compared to unperturbed motion.\n\nJustification involves considering how attraction modifies the path length experienced by incoming/outgoing waves; shorter paths result in less accumulated phase thus yielding overall negative shifts unless strong resonance conditions apply altering behavior fundamentally.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nPhase shift is expected to be negative,\n\\[\n\\boxed{-ve}.\n\\]"}

This phenomenon was first studied systematically by Heinrich Hertz but later explained theoretically by Albert Einstein. In these experiments, one measures the kinetic energy \\( K_e \\) of emitted electrons for different frequencies (\\( f \\)) and intensities of incident light.\n\n- **Classical Prediction:** According to classical wave theory, increasing the intensity should increase both the number and maximum kinetic energies of the emitted electrons since more photons would mean higher total energy transferable to each electron.\n- **Observed Phenomenon:** However, experimental results showed that:\n  - Electrons only start being ejected above a certain threshold frequency \\( f_0 \\), regardless of the intensity.\n  - For any given frequency greater than \\( f_0 \\), all electrons have the same initial kinetic energy independent of light's intensity; instead, varying intensity changes just the number of electrons released per unit time.\n\nThese observations cannot be reconciled with classical electromagnetic waves because classically there’s no reason why lower-frequency lights wouldn’t eventually eject electrons after sufficient exposure duration due to cumulative energy absorption.\n\n**Quantum Explanation:**\nEinstein proposed that light consists not of continuous waves but discrete packets called \"photons,\" where each photon has energy proportional to its frequency via Planck's constant \\( h \\):\n\\[ E = hf \\]\nElectron ejection occurs when individual photons interact directly with single electrons rather than collective interaction over many cycles of oscillation. Thus,\n\\[ hf = W + K_{e}^{\\max},\\] \nwhere \\(W\\) represents work function (minimum energy required to free an electron).\n\nThis equation explains why below \\(f_0\\), insufficient energy exists even within high-intensity beams to overcome \\(W\\). Above \\(f_0\\), excess energy goes into kinetic form post-emission.\n\n### Black Body Radiation Spectrum\n\n**Experiment Description:**\nBlackbody radiation refers to thermal emission spectra produced by heated objects.

Let's break down each part:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Part 1: Wave Function Periodicity\n\nGiven:\n- The initial state (wave function) \\(\\psi(x,t=0)\\) is real.\n- At some future time \\(t=t_1\\), the wave function remains real.\n\nThe Schrödinger equation for a quantum mechanical system with a real potential \\(V\\) can be written as:\n\\[ i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\psi(x,t) = H \\psi(x,t) \\]\nwhere \\(H\\) is the Hamiltonian operator given by:\n\\[ H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 + V(x) \\]\n\nSince both sides of the Schrödinger equation involve complex numbers, if \\(\\psi(x,t)\\) were purely imaginary or had non-zero imaginary parts initially, it would not remain so due to the nature of differential equations driven by Hermitian operators like \\(H\\).\n\nHowever, since \\(\\psi(x,t=0)\\) is real and evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, let’s consider its form after evolving up until \\(t=t_1\\):\n\\[ \\psi(x,t_1) = e^{-iE_nt_1/\\hbar} u_n(x) \\]\nHere, \\(u_n(x)\\) represents eigenfunctions corresponding to energies \\(E_n\\).\n\nFor \\(\\psi(x,t_1)\\) to also be real implies that any phase factor introduced during evolution from \\(t=0\\) to \\(t=t_1\\) should cancel out such that only real terms persist. This suggests there exists a specific relationship between times where these phases align perfectly again making the overall expression real.\n\nThus, considering general solutions involving multiple states,\n\\[ \\sum c_i e^{-i E_it / \\hbar } f_i(x) \\text{ being real at two distinct points indicates periodicity}. \\]\n\nThis leads us to conclude that the wave function will repeat itself periodically because the exponential factors \\(e^{(-iEt)/\\hbar}\\) have periods related to their respective frequencies (\\(T=\\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{|E|}\\)).\n\nTherefore, the wave function has a fundamental period \\(T\\):\n\n\\[ \\psi(x,t+T)=\\psi(x,t) \\]\n\nWhere \\(T\\) satisfies all conditions ensuring reality preservation through full cycles.\n\n#### Part 2: Energy Quantization Condition\n\nFrom above analysis, knowing the wave functions' periodic behavior directly ties into quantized energy levels via Fourier series representation which requires discrete values fitting within one cycle length \\(T\\).\n\nSpecifically, for the total probability density to match exactly every interval \\(T\\),\nthe allowed energies \\(E_k\\) must satisfy:\n\\[ E_k = k \\cdot \\Delta E \\quad \\text{(for integers $k$)} \\]\nwith \n\\[ \\Delta E = \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{T}.\\]\n\nSo, the possible energy levels are constrained to be integer multiples of \\(\\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{T}\\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining our findings,\n\nPeriodic Time Interval:\n\\[ \\boxed{T} \\]\n\nEnergy Levels Constraint:\n\\[ \\boxed{E_{k}=k\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{T}\\right)}, \\; k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\]"}

The scenario described involves a potential barrier with specific characteristics: it has two turning points \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\), which mark transitions between classically allowed and forbidden regions.\n\n### Step 1: Define Regions\n\nWe can divide our space into three distinct regions based on these turning points:\n- Region I (\\( -\\infty < x < x_1 \\)): Classically allowed.\n- Region II (\\( x_1 < x < x_2 \\)): Classical forbidden but potentially tunneled through.\n- Region III (\\( x > x_2 \\)): Another classically allowed region beyond the second turning point.\n\n### Step 2: Wave Functions in Each Region\n\nIn each region, the wave function will have different forms due to changes in kinetic energy relative to the potential:\n\n#### Region I (\\(-\\infty < x < x_1\\)):\nThe particle's total energy exceeds the local potential here; thus, the Schrödinger equation yields oscillatory solutions:\n\\[ \n\\Psi_I(x) = A e^{ikx} + B e^{-ikx}\n\\]\nwhere \\( k^2 = \\frac{2m(E-V)}{\\hbar^2} \\).\n\nHere, \\(A\\) represents the amplitude of incoming particles traveling rightward towards the barrier, while \\(B\\) corresponds to reflected particles moving leftwards away from the barrier.\n\n#### Region II (\\(x_1 < x < x_2\\)):\nThis area lies within the classically forbidden zone, so exponential decay functions dominate:\n\\[ \n\\Psi_{II}(x) = C e^{\\kappa x} + D e^{-\\kappa x},\n\\]\nwith \\( \\kappa^2 = \\frac{-2m(V-E)}{\\hbar^2} \\).\nSince typically one side decays faster as you move further inside the barrier, often only one term dominates depending on directionality.\n\nFor simplicity, assume tunneling occurs predominantly from left-to-right:\n\\[ \n\\Psi_{II}(x) \\approx Ce^{\\kappa x}.\n\\]\n\n#### Region III (\\(x > x_2\\)):\nAgain, back in a classically allowed regime similar to Region I:\n\\[ \n\\Psi_{III}(x) = F e^{iKx}, \n\\]\nassuming transmission without reflection since there’s no additional boundary after \\(x_2\\):\n\\( K^2 = \\frac{2m(E-V)}{\\hbar^2}\\),\nand assuming continuity across boundaries implies matching conditions.\n\n### Step 3: Matching Conditions Across Boundaries\n\nAt both interfaces \\(x=x_1\\) and \\(x=x_2\\):\n\nContinuity of the wavefunction itself,\n\\[ \n\\Psi_I(x_1^-)=\\Psi_{II}(x_1^+)\n\\] \n\nAnd its first derivative (due to smoothness requirement imposed by the differential nature of SE),\n\\[ \n(\\partial_x \\Psi)_I|_{x=x_1^-}= (\\partial_x \\Psi)_{II}|_{x=x_1^+}.  \n\\]\n\nSimilarly apply at interface \\(x=x_2\\),\n\nThese give us four equations involving six unknowns (\\(A,B,C,D,F,G\\)).
