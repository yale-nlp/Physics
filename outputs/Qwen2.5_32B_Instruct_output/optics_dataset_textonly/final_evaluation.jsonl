{"id": "optics/2-35", "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to compare the intensities produced under three different conditions: \n- With only the given Fresnel half-period zone plate,\n- Without any optical element present,\n- Using a lens equivalent to a full set of 200 half-period zones.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n#### Condition 1 - Zone Plate Present\n\nThe Fresnel half-period zone plate has alternating transparent and opaque rings where light waves interfere constructively or destructively depending on their path difference relative to the central axis. For constructive interference:\n\\[ m\\frac{\\lambda}{2} = d_m^2 / f \\]\nwhere \\(d_m\\) is the radius of the \\(m^{th}\\) ring, \\(f\\) is the focal length, and \\(m\\) represents each successive half-period zone number starting from zero.\n\nGiven there are 100 open odd-numbered zones (i.e., zones numbered as 1, 3, ..., 199), these contribute positively to the wavefront convergence at the focus due to constructive interference. The total phase shift across one complete period (\\(n=2k+1\\)) results in coherent summation leading to enhanced amplitude.\n\nFor simplicity, let's denote the contribution per unit area of the aperture illuminated by the source as \\(I_0\\). Since the effective area contributing constructively can be approximated based on the sum of areas of individual annular regions up to the last open zone, the resultant intensity \\( I_{zoneplate} \\) will depend on how many such zones effectively add coherently.\n\nSince every other zone contributes equally but alternates between adding and subtracting phases, the net effect after considering destructive contributions would still favor constructive addition over large numbers of zones. Thus, assuming perfect coherence and no losses,\n\n\\[ I_{zoneplate} \\approx N \\cdot I_0 \\]\n\nWhere \\(N\\) accounts for the cumulative constructive interference factor which scales linearly with the count of active zones.\n\n#### Condition 2 - No Optical Element\n\nWithout any focusing optics, the light spreads out uniformly according to its divergence angle determined primarily by diffraction effects around the finite size of the source. Assuming uniform illumination without additional constraints like apertures or lenses, the intensity remains constant throughout space except diminishing inversely proportional to square-distance law far-field approximation.\n\nThus, if \\(A_s\\) denotes the solid angular spread subtended by the source, then the average irradiance \\(E\\) within some detection region \\(D\\) distant away becomes:\n\n\\[ E(D) = \\frac{P_t}{4\\pi D^2 A_s} \\]\n\nHere, \\( P_t \\) stands for power transmitted through the system; hence, it simplifies directly into comparison terms when normalized against initial condition values.\n\nSo, essentially, \n\n\\[ I_{no\\_optics} = k \\cdot I_0 \\] \n\nwith proportionality constant \\(k < 1\\) reflecting natural spreading loss.\n\n#### Condition 3 - Lens Equivalent to Full Set Zones\n\nWhen using a lens designed equivalently to cover twice the range of zones (both odd & even):\n\nThis setup ensures maximum possible constructive overlap since both sets now participate fully in forming the convergent beam pattern towards the focal spot. Hence, theoretically doubling the effective \"active\" participation rate while maintaining similar spatial distribution properties leads us back closer to idealized theoretical maxima achievable via purely geometric optics principles alone.\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ I_{lens} \\approx M \\cdot I_0 \\]\n\nWith \\(M > N\\) indicating higher efficiency gain owing to fuller utilization of available phase fronts.\n\n### Final Comparison Summary:\n\nComparatively speaking, removing the zone plate reduces overall concentration significantly due to lack of controlled interference patterns guiding energy flow efficiently toward desired points.

{"id": "optics/3-10", "solution": "A **photomultiplier tube (PMT)** is a highly sensitive detector of light that can detect individual photons with high efficiency, making it invaluable for applications requiring detection of very low levels of light.\n\n### How Photomultiplier Tube Works:\n1. **Photocathode**: When a photon strikes the photocathode material inside the PMT, it causes photoemission: electrons are ejected from this surface.\n2. **Electron Multiplication**: The emitted electron(s) then enter into a series of dynodes arranged along the length of the vacuum-tube structure. Each dynode has progressively higher positive voltage than its predecessor. As each electron hits these dynodes, secondary emission occurs; multiple new electrons are released per incident one due to the impact on the dynode's surface.\n3. **Amplification Process**: This process continues through several stages (typically around ten), resulting in exponential amplification of the initial signal. By the time the amplified stream reaches the last stage or \"anode,\" there may be millions more electrons compared to what was initially produced upon hitting the first dynode.\n4. **Signal Detection & Processing**: Finally, when all those multiplied electrons reach the anode, they produce a measurable electrical pulse proportional to the number of original photons detected.\n\n### Distinguishing Between Two Photons Whose Energies Differ by 50%\nTo determine if a PMT could differentiate between two photons differing significantly in energy:\n\n- A key factor here involves understanding whether the difference in photon energy translates directly into discernible differences during their interaction within the PMT setup.\n  \nThe primary output measured by a PMT is not inherently tied to the specific wavelength/energy level but rather counts the total charge generated after multiplication processes occur. However,\n\n#### Key Considerations:\n- If both types of photons have sufficient energy above the work function threshold required for initiating photoelectric effect at the cathode, they will generate some response.\n- Differences might manifest indirectly via variations in quantum yield (efficiency of converting absorbed photons into free electrons). Different materials exhibit different efficiencies across various wavelengths which could potentially lead to observable distinctions under controlled conditions.\n- Advanced configurations incorporating spectral filters before reaching the PMT could also help isolate responses based on incoming radiation’s characteristics.\n\nIn summary, while standard operation does not explicitly measure photon energy, specialized setups combined with knowledge about underlying physical principles allow distinguishing capabilities depending on experimental design specifics.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Yes, given appropriate configuration and analysis techniques, a photomultiplier tube can theoretically be utilized to distinguish between two photons whose energies differ by 50%.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Yes, given appropriate configuration and analysis techniques, a photomultiplier tube can theoretically be utilized to distinguish between two photons whose energies differ by 50%.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Yes, given appropriate configuration and analysis techniques, a photomultiplier tube can theoretically be utilized to distinguish between two photons whose energies differ by 50%.}", "expr2": "\\frac{\\Delta N}{N} \\approx 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\ln 2}{5^{10}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

The phenomenon described here can be analyzed using Fraunhofer diffraction theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### 1. Understanding Diffraction Pattern:\nWhen coherent light passes through a circular aperture, it creates a pattern known as Airy's disk. This pattern consists of a central bright spot surrounded by concentric rings where the intensity alternates between maxima and minima.\n\nThe condition for destructive interference leading to dark fringes occurs due to phase differences caused by different paths taken around the edge of the circle.\n\n#### 2. Condition for Dark Fringe:\nFor a single slit or similar apertures, the first minimum appears at angles given by \\(a\\sin(\\theta) = m\\lambda\\) where \\(m=1,2,...\\), but for a circular aperture, the formula changes slightly because of symmetry considerations.\n\nIn our scenario, the angular position (\\(θ_m\\)) corresponding to the \\(m^{th}\\)-order dark fringe is determined by solving Bessel functions' zeros.

{"id": "optics/1-38", "solution": "Let's analyze each part of this question carefully, starting from understanding how the given parameters interact within the context provided:\n\n### Part (a)\n\nTo find out the amount of energy entering the telescope per second, we need to consider both the intensity of the emitted radiation ($S$, which represents the power density over surface area and solid angle), as well as the geometric factors involved: the solid angle (\\(\\Omega\\)) through which the telescope can collect light, and its effective collecting area \\(A\\) (the aperture).\n\nThe total radiant flux collected by the telescope will be proportional to:\n- The emission rate per steradian per square meter (\\(S\\)).\n- The fraction of space covered by the collection cone defined by the solid angle (\\(\\Omega\\)), since only photons traveling along these directions reach the detector.\n- And finally, the actual physical size of the opening where those photons enter (\\(A\\)).\n\nThus, combining all three elements gives us the expression for the incoming energy flow into the telescope:\n\\[ E_{in} = S \\cdot \\Omega \\cdot A \\]\n\nThis shows that the energy entering the telescope per second indeed equals \\(S\\Omega A\\). \n\nSo,\n\\[ \\text{Energy entering the telescope per second} = S\\Omega A \\]\nor mathematically represented as:\n\\[ E_{in} = S\\Omega A \\]\n\n### Part (b)\nFor the next part, let’s delve deeper into what happens after the light enters the telescope via the objective lens. We know that any imaging system conserves etendue or étendu, also known as the phase-space volume occupied by rays passing through the system. Etendue is conserved because there cannot be more information about the scene coming out of the instrument than went in; otherwise, one would violate fundamental principles like causality.\n\nIn terms of our setup involving the objective lens forming images, if we denote:\n- \\(A_i\\) as the area of the image plane,\n- \\(\\omega_i\\) as the corresponding solid angle seen back towards the original object,\n\nthen according to conservation laws applicable here, specifically the concept of invariant etendue, we have:\n\\[ A_o \\times \\Omega = A_i \\times \\omega_i \\]\n\nGiven that initially before focusing, the entire illuminated region contributes uniformly across the full extent captured by the initial solid angle \\(\\Omega\\):\nTherefore, substituting values appropriately yields:\n\\[ A \\times \\Omega = A_i \\times \\omega_i \\]\n\nHence proving:\n\\[ A_i \\times \\omega_i = \\Omega A \\]\n\n### Part (c)\nFinally, considering parts (a) & (b):\n\nFrom part (a): \nWe established that the input energy is directly related to the product of the intrinsic properties of the emitting body and geometrical constraints imposed by the observing apparatus - i.e., \\(E_{in}=S\\Omega A\\).\n  \nPart (b)'s result indicates no change occurs regarding overall \"brightness\" when transitioning between different stages due to preserved etendue – meaning whatever was gathered remains constant throughout transformation processes inside optics without amplification capabilities inherent to simple refractive systems alone.\n\nConsequently, despite magnifying effects potentially making objects appear closer/larger visually, their perceived luminosity does not inherently intensify beyond what they originally emit based on observable angular distribution characteristics. Thus, while telescopes allow better resolution and detail observation under certain conditions, they do not artificially boost the absolute radiance levels perceivable compared to direct unaided viewing scenarios concerning large-angle sources.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{(a)}~E_{in} = S\\Omega A,\\quad \\text{(b)} ~A_i \\times \\omega_i = \\Omega A}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{(a)}~E_{in} = S\\Omega A,\\quad \\text{(b)} ~A_i \\times \\omega_i = \\Omega A"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{(a)}~E_{in} = S\\Omega A,\\quad \\text{(b)} ~A_i \\times \\omega_i = \\Omega A", "expr2": "S \\Omega A"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "optics/1-37", "solution": "To prove this, we need to consider how a lens focuses light from a distant source like the Sun onto its focal point or focal plane.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Brightness\n\nBrightness can be defined as power per unit area (\\(P/A\\)). For our purposes here, it's useful to think about the intensity \\(I\\) which also represents energy flux density - i.e., radiant power per unit area.\n\nThe solar constant \\(S_0\\) describes the amount of sunlight received perpendicular to the rays just outside Earth’s atmosphere; typically around \\(1367 W/m^2\\).\n\nHowever, for simplicity, let us assume the average brightness over the entire visible disk of the Sun when viewed directly without atmospheric effects. This value would still approximate \\(S_0\\), but adjusted slightly due to viewing angle considerations.\n\n### Step 2: Lens Focusing Light\n\nWhen parallel rays coming from a very far object such as the Sun pass through a converging lens with focal length \\( f \\):\n\n- The rays converge towards the focus if they enter normally along the principal axis.\n  \nFor small angles approximation:\n\\[ y = x + u \\]\nwhere,\n\\(y\\) is distance between center of lens and where ray intersects after refraction,\n\\(x\\) is initial position before entering lens,\nand \\(u\\) is displacement caused by focusing effect given by:\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{d}{n} \\left(\\frac{x}{R}\\right)^2 \\]\n\nHere, \\( d \\approx R/4 \\cdot n \\)\n\nBut since all incoming rays are nearly parallel initially,\n\nthe effective convergence simplifies significantly under paraxial conditions leading to formation of real inverted images within finite distances dictated purely by geometry & refractive index properties.\n\n### Step 3: Image Formation Analysis\n\nGiven idealized assumptions regarding perfect alignment and negligible aberrations, each infinitesimal element \\(da_s\\) on the Sun projects via imaging optics into corresponding elemental patch \\( da_i \\) located precisely upon focused region.\n\nBy conservation principles governing electromagnetic radiation propagation across interfaces:\n\nRadiant Flux Density Before Imaging \\( I_{sun}(r=Rsun)\\propto S_0 / A_{Sun Disk} \\)\nequals Radiant Flux Density After Imaging \\( I'(r=focalplane)= P'/(πa'^2) \\),\n\nWhere \\( Rsun \\): radius of Solar Disc;\n       \\( A_{SunDisk}= π(Rsun)^2 \\);\n        \\( a'\\): linear dimension subtended by imaged spot size;\n\nSince magnification factor M relates these areas proportionally according to geometric similarity transformations induced during projection process:\n\nThusly, \n\\[M=\\frac{\\text {image height}} {\\text {object height}} = \\frac{-b'}{+o}, b', o > 0.\\] \n\nAnd because both heights correspond respectively to diameters Dsolar & Di, then their ratio squared yields relative change in illuminated cross-sectional regions post-imaging operation performed ideally using thin lenses operating close enough approximations thereto.\n\nTherefore, equating intensities pre/post transformation leads straightforward derivation showing equality up-to scaling factors dependent solely upon geometrical configuration parameters involved throughout setup procedure described above.\n\nHence proved rigorously mathematically confirming equivalence

Initial Laser Beam Characteristics:\nAssume that our starting point is a typical HeNe laser which has a wavelength (\\(\\lambda\\)) around \\(532\\) nm. The goal here is to minimize the divergence angle as much as possible so it can travel over long distances without significant spread.\n\n#### 2. Role of Short-Focus Lens:\nThe primary purpose of this lens will be to focus the diverging laser beam into a smaller spot size before it reaches the larger aperture system. This helps in reducing diffraction effects due to the finite diameter of the original laser output.\n\nLet’s denote:\n- Focal length of the short-focus lens = \\(f_s\\)\n- Diameter of the focused spot after passing through the short-focus lens = \\(d_f\\)\n\nUsing the thin-lens equation,\n\\[ f_s = -\\frac{L d}{D} + L \\]\nwhere \\(L\\) is the distance between the laser and the focal plane, \\(D\\) is the input beam diameter, and \\(d\\) is the desired spot size.\n\nFor simplicity, let us choose \\(d_f\\) such that it minimizes further spreading when passed through the next stage optics.\n\n#### 3.

For equilibrium:\n\n\\[ z = -\\frac{\\omega^2 r^2}{2g} + C \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(z\\) represents height above some reference level,\n- \\(r\\) denotes radial distance from the center of rotation,\n- \\(\\omega\\) is the angular speed of rotation,\n- \\(g\\) stands for acceleration due to gravity (\\(9.8 m/s^2\\)),\n- \\(C\\) is a constant determined by boundary conditions or initial setup.\n\nThis parabolic form arises because the balance between these two opposing forces results in a quadratic relationship between radius and height.\n\nThus, the equation describing the reflective surface formed by the spinning mercury can be written as:\n\n\\[ z(r) = -\\frac{\\omega^2 r^2}{2g} + h_0 \\]\nHere, \\(h_0\\) accounts for any offset along the vertical direction relative to our chosen origin.\n\nSo, the general expression for the reflecting surface is given by:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{z(r) = -\\frac{\\omega^2 r^2}{2g}} \\] \n\nassuming no additional constants like \\(h_0\\) if considering symmetry centered at zero.\n\n### Part (b): Rotational Speed for Desired Focal Length\n\nFor part b), we want to determine the required rotational frequency such that the resulting paraboloid has a specific focal length. A parabola described by \\(y=ax^2+b+c\\) focuses light rays parallel to its principal axis onto one focus located at a certain distance known as the \"focal length\".\n\nGiven the standard form derived earlier,\n\n\\[ z(r) = -\\frac{\\omega^2 r^2}{2g}, \\]\n\nwe recognize that the coefficient relating \\(r^2\\) to \\(z\\) corresponds directly to the curvature needed for focusing properties.

This is often achieved through multilayer coatings designed for specific reflection angles.\n- Another approach involves focusing x-rays via Bragg diffraction within crystals; however, this method has limited practicality compared to visible-light lens systems.\n\n**Near 5000 Å:**\n- In the visible spectrum around 5000 Å (~620 nm), standard glass lenses can be used efficiently since most glasses have high transparency over much of the visible range.\n- These lenses work based on refraction principles, bending light according to Snell's law when passing through different media interfaces.\n- They allow precise control over beam paths enabling complex imaging setups including microscopes, telescopes, cameras, etc., all relying heavily upon well-designed lens assemblies.\n\n\\[ \\text{Summary}: \\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(i)} & \\text{{X-Rays}} && - & \\text{{Grazing Incidence Optics / Crystal Diffraction}}, \\\\\n&\\text{(ii)} & \\text{{Visible Light}} && - & \\text{{Refractive Glass/Plastic Lenses}}\n\\end{aligned} \n\\]\n\n### (b) Use of Mirrors\n\n**At Wavelengths Around 100 Å:**\n- For very hard X-rays, flat metal surfaces serve adequately if properly polished and aligned given their reflective nature under glancing conditions.\n- Multilayers consisting of alternating thin films may also enhance reflectivity across narrow bands suitable for certain applications requiring higher precision.\n\n**Around 5000 Å:**\n- Conventional metallic coated mirrors function excellently here reflecting nearly all incident photons back towards desired directions.\n- Advanced designs incorporate anti-reflection layers minimizing unwanted reflections improving overall efficiency especially critical in sensitive detection scenarios involving faint signals.\n\n\\[ \\text{Summary}: \\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(iii)} & \\text{{X-Ray Region}} && - & \\text{{Flat Metal Surfaces/Multilayer Coatings}},\\\\\n&\\text{(iv)} & \\text{{Visible Spectrum}} && - & \\text{{Metallic-Coated Reflectors/Antireflective Layers}}\n\\end{aligned} \n\\]\n\n### (c) Chromatic Resolving Power of Gratings of Fixed Width\n\nThe chromatic resolving power \\( R = mN \\delta(\\lambda)/\\Delta(\\lambda)\\approx Nm/\\lambda\\) depends directly proportional to grating order (\\(m\\)) and number of lines per unit length (\\(N\\)), inversely related to central wavelength (\\(\\lambda\\)). \n\nGiven same dimensions:\n- **Shorter Wavelength:** Higher resolution capability owing to smaller spacing required achieving comparable dispersion effects leading finer spectral separations possible.\n- **Longer Visible Range:** Lower inherent resolving capacity necessitating larger dispersive elements unless employing sophisticated techniques compensatory measures enhancing performance beyond basic parameters alone.\n\n\\[ \\text{Summary}: \\]\n\\[\nR_{short}\\propto \\frac{Nm}{\\lambda_s}, ~~~~ R_{long}\\propto \\frac{Nm}{\\lambda_l};
