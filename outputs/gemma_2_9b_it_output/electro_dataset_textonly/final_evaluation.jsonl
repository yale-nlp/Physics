We want to find the magnetic field strength *inside* the solenoid, very close to the central axis, but specifically at the open end.  The key here is that we're assuming  $r << R$, meaning we're looking at points much closer to the axis than the solenoid's radius. This allows us to simplify our calculations using approximations.\n\n**2. Ampere's Law**\n\nAmpere's law is perfect for finding magnetic fields created by currents.

Applying Ampere's Law**\n\n* The magnetic field **B** is constant in magnitude along our chosen loop due to cylindrical symmetry.\n* The angle between **B** and d**l** is zero everywhere along the loop.\n\nTherefore, Ampere's law simplifies to:\n\nB ⋅ 2πr = μ₀ I<sub>enc</sub>\n\n**5. Determining Enclosed Current**\n\nThe enclosed current depends on whether we are inside or outside the solenoid. Since we are considering the region very near the end ($r<<R$), we can approximate the solenoid as infinitely long. In this case, the enclosed current is simply the current flowing through the portion of the solenoid within our Amperian loop.\n\nFor r << R, almost all the current from the solenoid passes through our loop.

Applying Gauss's law:\n\n$$\\oint E \\cdot dA = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon}$$\n\nSince the electric field is radial and uniform, this simplifies to:\n\n$$E \\cdot A = \\frac{Q}{\\epsilon}$$\n\nSolving for the electric field:\n\n$$E = \\frac{Q}{A \\epsilon}$$\n\nThe potential difference (V) between the conductors is related to the electric field by:\n\n$$V = Ed$$\n\nwhere d is the distance between the conductors.

Therefore:\n\n* **Electric Field**:  $\\mathbf{E} = k \\frac{q}{r^2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ where $k$ is Coulomb's constant, $q$ is the charge of each positron, and $r$ is the distance between them. Here, $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ is the unit vector pointing from $e^+_1$ to $e^+_2$.\n\n* **Magnetic Field**: Since the charges are static, there is no magnetic field generated: $\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{0}$\n\n* **Lorentz Force**: $\\mathbf{F} = q(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) = q\\mathbf{E}$ since $\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{0}$. This gives us: $\\mathbf{F} = k \\frac{q^2}{r^2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$.\n\n* **Acceleration**: Using Newton's second law, we get $\\mathbf{a} = \\frac{\\mathbf{F}}{m} = k \\frac{q^2}{mr^2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$, where $m$ is the mass of the positron.\n\n\n**Laboratory Frame:**\n\nIn the laboratory frame ($S$), the positrons are moving with velocity $\\mathbf{v}$. We need to use special relativity to account for the motion.\n\n* **Electric Field**: The electric field due to a moving charge is given by the Lienard-Wiechert potentials. However, for simplicity, we can approximate it using the classical expression modified by a factor related to the relative velocity: $\\mathbf{E}' = \\gamma \\mathbf{E}$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n* **Magnetic Field**: A moving charge generates a magnetic field. Its magnitude and direction depend on the velocity and position of the charge. It can be calculated using Biot-Savart Law or Ampere's Law. For simplicity, let's denote the magnetic field contribution from $e^+_2$ seen by $e^+_1$ as $\\mathbf{B}'$.\n\n* **Lorentz Force**: Now, the Lorentz force becomes: $\\mathbf{F}' = q (\\mathbf{E}' + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}') = q (\\gamma \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}')$.\n\n* **Acceleration**: Finally, the acceleration is obtained as: $\\mathbf{a}' = \\frac{\\mathbf{F}'}{m} = \\frac{q}{m}(\\gamma \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}')$.\n\n\n\n**Intuitive Explanations:**\n\n* **Relativistic Factors**: The presence of the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ arises because of the high speed of the positrons. Special relativity dictates that measurements of space and time change depending on the observer's frame of reference. As the speed approaches the speed of light, these changes become significant. Consequently, the electric field experienced by one positron in its own rest frame differs from what another observer in a different inertial frame would measure. Similarly, the magnetic field also gets affected by the relative motion.\n\n* **Directionality**: The direction of the forces and accelerations depends on the relative velocities and positions of the positrons.

{"id": "electro/5_10", "solution": "Here's a breakdown of how to solve this problem, keeping in mind the complexities introduced by special relativity:\n\n**(a) Electromagnetic Field from Observer B's Perspective**\n\n* **Understanding the Setup:**  Observer A sees a stationary charged wire carrying a current. This means there will be both electric and magnetic fields around the wire according to classical electromagnetism. However, observer B, who is also moving at relativistic speeds, will see things differently due to length contraction and time dilation. \n\n* **Relativistic Transformations:** We need to use Lorentz transformations to relate the electric and magnetic fields observed by A to those observed by B. These transformations depend on the relative velocity *v* between the observers.\n\n* **The Fields:** Due to the symmetry of the situation, we can assume that the electric field along the axis of the wire is zero in both frames. The magnetic field will likely have components perpendicular to the wire's axis in both frames.\n\n* **Calculating the Fields:** To get specific expressions for the fields in B's frame, you would apply the appropriate Lorentz transformation equations for the electric and magnetic fields. This involves some vector algebra and careful consideration of the directionality of the fields.\n\n**(b) Charge Density Implied by the Field**\n\n* **Gauss's Law:** In any inertial frame, Gauss's law relates the electric field to the enclosed charge density. By analyzing the electric field calculated in part (a), we can determine the charge density perceived by observer B. Keep in mind that this charge density might differ from the one observed by A because of the effects of motion.\n\n**(c) Velocities of Electron and Ion Streams**\n\n* **Current Continuity:** The total current flowing through the wire must remain constant in all inertial frames. Since the wire has no net charge, it consists of equal and oppositely charged particles – electrons and ions.\n\n* **Relative Motion:** The velocities of the electron and ion streams in B's frame can be determined using the fact that their combined flow maintains the same current as observed by A. You'll need to consider the relativistic Doppler effect and other relativistic corrections when calculating these velocities.\n\n\n**(d) Accounting for Different Charge Densities**\n\n* **Length Contraction:** One key factor is length contraction. From B's perspective, the wire appears shorter than its actual length due to its motion. This apparent shortening could lead to a higher concentration of charges within the contracted region, resulting in a non-zero charge density even though A observes none.\n\n* **Time Dilation:** Time dilation also plays a role. The passage of time slows down for objects moving at relativistic speeds. This means that the rate at which charges appear to accumulate or disperse in the wire may differ between the two frames.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you want me to work out the detailed calculations for the electromagnetic fields and velocities.

Understanding the Problem**\n\nA moving charged object in a magnetic field experiences a force due to the Lorentz force law.  Since our sphere is perfectly conducting, any charges within it will move freely until they distribute themselves in such a way that the electric field inside the conductor becomes zero (due to electrostatic equilibrium). This redistribution of charge creates an induced surface charge density. \n\n**2. Applying the Lorentz Force Law**\n\nThe Lorentz force acting on a charge *q* moving with velocity **v** in a magnetic field **B** is given by:\n\n$$\\mathbf{F} = q(\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$$\n\nFor a charge element *dq* on the surface of the sphere, the force is:\n\n$$\\mathbf{F} = dq (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})$$\n\nSubstituting the given values for **v** and **B**:\n\n$$\\mathbf{F} = dq (v \\mathbf{e}_x \\times B \\mathbf{e}_y) = dqvB \\mathbf{e}_z$$\n\nThis means the force acts along the z-direction, pushing charges towards the top and bottom poles of the sphere.\n\n**3. Induced Electric Field and Charge Distribution**\n\nDue to the Lorentz force, charges accumulate at the poles. This accumulation creates an electric field inside the conductor. To maintain electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field must eventually become zero inside the conductor. The resulting charge distribution will be symmetric about the x-axis.\n\n**4. Surface Charge Density**\n\nLet σ(θ) be the surface charge density as a function of polar angle θ (measured from the positive x-axis). We can relate σ(θ) to the electric field using Gauss's law. Due to symmetry, we can choose a Gaussian surface as a spherical cap centered on the equator.\n\nApplying Gauss's law:\n\n$$\\oint \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}$$\n\nwhere Q<sub>enc</sub> is the enclosed charge.

So, ∫ B₁ dl = 0. This means B₁ must be zero.\n\n* **In the Gap:** Now consider the section of the loop lying within the gap. Here, the magnetic field lines are not perfectly aligned with the loop due to the presence of the air gap. However, because s << d, we can still approximate the field as relatively uniform across the gap width.\n    * Let B₂ be the magnetic field strength in the gap.\n    * The current enclosed by our loop in the gap is N I, where N is the number of turns in the coil.\n\nTherefore, applying Ampere's law to the entire loop gives us:\n\n∫ B₂ dl = μ₀ NI\n\nSince the loop is circular, ∫ B₂ dl = B₂(2πR).

However, since we are interested in solutions valid outside the conductor ($r > R$), we focus on the asymptotic behavior of the Bessel function solutions. For large *r*, they behave like $r^{-1}$ and $r^{1}$. We discard the $r^{-1}$ term because it would diverge at the origin.

Understanding the Forces:**\n\n* **Electrostatic Repulsion:**  Each corner charge will exert a repulsive electrostatic force on the central charge due to their like charges. \n\n* **Symmetry Considerations:** The cube's symmetry suggests that the forces from opposite corner charges will be equal in magnitude but act along opposite directions.

All faces except one are grounded, meaning they have a potential of zero volts. The remaining face is held at a potential *V*. We want to find the electric potential at the center of the dodecahedron.\n\n**2. Symmetry Considerations**\n\nDue to the symmetry of the dodecahedron, we can make some simplifying assumptions:\n\n* **Equal Potential on Each Face:** Since all the pentagonal faces are identical and equally spaced around the central point, the potential will be uniform across each face.\n* **Central Point as Center of Charge Distribution:** The charge distribution responsible for the potential at the center will be symmetrical about the central point.\n\n**3. Using Gauss's Law**\n\nGauss's law states that the flux of the electric field through any closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge. Mathematically:\n\n∮E⋅dA = Q_enclosed / ε₀\n\nwhere:\n\n* E is the electric field\n* dA is an infinitesimal area element on the Gaussian surface\n* Q_enclosed is the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface\n* ε₀ is the permittivity of free space\n\n**4. Choosing a Gaussian Surface**\n\nTo simplify our calculation, let's choose a spherical Gaussian surface centered at the center of the dodecahedron. This surface encloses all the charges contributing to the potential at the center.\n\n**5. Applying Gauss's Law**\n\nSince the electric field due to a uniformly charged sphere is radial and its magnitude depends only on the distance from the center, the integral simplifies significantly.  The electric field lines pass perpendicularly through the spherical Gaussian surface everywhere. Therefore:\n\n∫E⋅dA = E ∫dA = E * 4πr²\n\nWhere r is the radius of the Gaussian surface.\n\nNow, consider the charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. It consists of the charge induced on the grounded faces and the charge associated with the face held at potential *V*. Due to the grounding, the net charge on the grounded faces will be zero. So, the only contribution to the enclosed charge comes from the face at potential *V*.\n\nLet σ be the surface charge density on the face at potential *V*. Then, the total charge enclosed is:\n\nQ_enclosed = σ * Area of the pentagon\n\nUsing Gauss's law equation:\n\nE * 4πr² = σ * Area of the pentagon / ε₀\n\nSolving for E:\n\nE = (σ * Area of the pentagon) / (4πε₀r²)\n\n**6. Finding the Electric Potential**\n\nThe electric potential at a point is related to the electric field by:\n\ndV = -E ⋅ dr\n\nIntegrating this equation from infinity to the center of the dodecahedron (r=0), we get the potential at the center:\n\nV(center) = -∫∞⁰ E ⋅ dr\n\nSubstitute the expression for E derived earlier and integrate.

The key is that the induced currents in the cylinder create a magnetic field that opposes the motion of the dipole. This opposing force eventually balances the gravitational force, leading to terminal velocity.\n\n**2.

Due to symmetry, the magnetic field lines will be concentric circles around the axis.\n\n**3. Force on the Dipole**\n\n* **Magnetic Torque:** The induced magnetic field exerts a torque on the dipole, trying to align it against its initial orientation. However, since the dipole is assumed to always align with the axis, this torque doesn't contribute to the vertical force.\n* **Magnetic Force:** The induced magnetic field also exerts a force on the dipole along its length. This force acts opposite to the direction of motion, providing the resistance needed to reach terminal velocity.\n\n**4. Calculating the Force**\n\nTo calculate the force, we need to integrate the magnetic force density over the volume of the dipole.

We know that like charges repel and opposite charges attract. Since electric current consists of moving charges, one might expect the current to concentrate towards the center of the wire due to the attractive force between parallel currents. However, experiments show that the current distribution is usually uniform. This discrepancy arises because of the interplay between electrostatic forces and magnetic forces.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1. **Electrostatic Force:** The stationary positive charges create an electric field around them. Due to their fixed position, they experience no net force from other charges.\n\n2. **Magnetic Force:** The moving negative charges generate a magnetic field around them. According to Ampere's Law, this magnetic field will exert a force on the nearby positive charges.\n\n3. **Force Balance:** For a uniform current distribution, the magnetic force acting on each positive charge must balance the electrostatic repulsion it would feel if all the charges were static.\n\n4. **Lorentz Transformation:** To analyze the situation correctly, we need to consider the effects of special relativity.
