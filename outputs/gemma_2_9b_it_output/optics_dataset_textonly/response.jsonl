What is the instrument's resolving power?\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "##  Fabry-Perot Interferometer: A Step-by-Step Explanation\n\nThe Fabry-Perot interferometer is a device that utilizes constructive interference to analyze light waves. It consists of two highly reflective parallel mirrors separated by a small distance 'L'. \n\n**Here's how it works:**\n\n1. **Light enters the cavity:** Light from a source (e.g., laser) strikes one mirror, which reflects it towards the other mirror.\n\n2. **Multiple reflections:** The light undergoes multiple reflections between the two mirrors due to their high reflectivity. Each reflection creates a new wavefront with a phase shift depending on its path length difference.\n\n3. **Constructive Interference:** When the path length difference between successive reflected beams becomes an integer multiple of the wavelength (λ), they interfere constructively. This results in bright fringes or maxima.\n\n4. **Destructive Interference:** If the path length difference is not an integer multiple of λ, destructive interference occurs, leading to dark fringes or minima.\n\n\n**Deriving the Equation for Maxima Positions:**\n\nConsider a beam reflecting back and forth between the mirrors. For constructive interference, the optical path difference must be an integer multiple of the wavelength:\n\n```\n2nL = mλ\n```\n\nwhere:\n\n* n is the refractive index of the medium between the mirrors\n* L is the distance between the mirrors\n* m is an integer representing the order of the maximum (m=0 corresponds to the central maximum)\n* λ is the wavelength of the light\n\nSolving for L, we get the position of the maxima:\n\n```\nL_m = (mλ)/(2n)\n```\n\n**Shape of Maxima:**\n\nThe intensity distribution of the maxima is not perfectly sharp but rather has a characteristic Airy function profile. This arises due to finite coherence length of the light source and imperfections in the mirrors. The Airy function describes a series of peaks surrounded by decreasing side lobes.\n\n**Resolving Power:**\n\nThe resolving power (R) of a Fabry-Perot interferometer is defined as the ratio of the center wavelength (λ₀) to the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of a spectral line:\n\n```\nR = λ₀ / Δλ\n```\n\nWhere Δλ represents the FWHM of the observed spectrum.\n\nFor a Fabry-Perot interferometer, the FWHM can be approximated as:\n\n```\nΔλ ≈ λ₀/(2π√(R))\n```\n\nTherefore, the resolving power depends on the finesse (defined as the ratio of free spectral range to FWHM) and the number of passes through the cavity. Higher finesse leads to higher resolving power.\n\n\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\\boxed{ \\begin{aligned}\nL_m &= \\frac{m\\lambda}{2n}\\\\\nR &\\approx \\frac{\\lambda_0}{\\Delta \\lambda} = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{ \\lambda_0/(2\\pi\\sqrt{R})} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{R}\n\\end{aligned}} \\]"}

It consists of alternating transparent and opaque rings arranged such that each ring corresponds to a specific phase delay.  The key principle behind its operation is constructive interference of light waves emanating from different parts of the aperture.\n\n* **Half-Period Zones:** Each zone has a radius proportional to the square root of the order number (n). The path difference between rays originating from opposite edges of a zone should be equal to half the wavelength (λ/2) for constructive interference. This ensures focusing at a particular point.\n\n**Intensity Calculation**\n\n1. **Zone Plate Removed:** When there's no zone plate, the light behaves like it would from a simple point source. Assuming the source emits uniformly in all directions, the intensity at any point on the axis will decrease inversely with the square of the distance from the source.\n\n2. **Fresnel Half-Period Zone Plate:** With the zone plate, only odd numbered zones are open. This means the wavefronts interfere constructively at the focus while destructive interference occurs elsewhere. The resulting intensity distribution will have a central maximum (the focus) surrounded by diffraction fringes.\n\n    * To calculate the exact intensity pattern, we need to use Huygens-Fresnel Principle and integrate over the contributions from each individual zone. However, since we're comparing intensities relative to the case without the zone plate, we can make some simplifying assumptions:\n        * We assume the central maximum is well-defined and much brighter than the surrounding fringes.\n        * We approximate the intensity at the focus as being proportional to the total power transmitted through the open zones.\n\n3. **Lens Comparison:** A lens with the same focal length and diameter as the zone plate effectively covers 200 half-period zones.

Each zone is designed to have a path length difference corresponding to half a wavelength for constructive interference at the focal point.\n\n3. **Path Length Difference:** For the central maximum (the brightest spot) to be located 1 meter behind the zone plate, the path length difference between rays originating from the center of each zone must satisfy the condition:\n\n    ```\n    ΔL = mλ/2 \n    ```\n\n    where:\n     * ΔL is the path length difference\n     * m is an integer representing the order of the bright fringe (m=0 for the central maximum)\n     * λ is the wavelength of the light\n\n4. **Geometry:** Consider the geometry of the setup.

You may assume a thin lens ($d \\ll a$).\n\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "Here's how we can solve this problem:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe want to design a lens where the refractive index varies radially within a circular disc. This means that light passing through different parts of the lens will bend (refract) differently, focusing light rays to a point at a distance *F*.  Since the lens is considered thin, we can use simplified geometric optics approximations.\n\n**2.

These rays experience minimal deviation due to the lens curvature.\n\n**5. Setting up the Solution**\n\nLet's consider a ray of light incident on the lens at an angle $\\theta$ relative to the optical axis. Due to the radial variation of the refractive index, the ray will refract differently depending on its position.\n\n* At a radial distance *r*, the refractive index is *n(r)*.\n* Using the small angle approximation and considering paraxial rays, the change in direction of the ray after passing through the lens can be approximated as:\n\n$$\\Delta \\theta \\approx \\left[ \\frac{dn(r)}{dr} \\right] \\cdot r \\cdot d $$\n\nwhere *d* is the thickness of the lens.\n\nThis change in angle contributes to the overall focusing effect of the lens.

Light entering a droplet refracts (bends) because it slows down in water compared to air.\n\n2. **Dispersion:** White sunlight separates into its component colors (spectrum) due to the varying refractive indices of each color within the water droplet.\n\n3. **Internal Reflection:** Some of the dispersed light reflects off the back surface of the droplet.\n\n4. **Second Refraction:** As the reflected light exits the droplet, it refracts again, further separating the colors.\n\n5. **Observer Position:** We see a rainbow only when the angle between the sun, the raindrops, and our eye is just right (approximately 42 degrees).\n\n**Final Answer (c):** A rainbow forms due to the refraction, dispersion, and internal reflection of sunlight within water droplets, resulting in the separation of colors.\n\n\n\n**(d) Twinkling of Stars**\n\n1. **Atmospheric Turbulence:** Starlight passes through Earth's turbulent atmosphere, which contains layers of air with varying temperatures and densities.\n\n2. **Light Bending:** These variations cause the starlight to bend slightly and unpredictably as it travels towards us.\n\n3. **Apparent Flicker:** Our eyes perceive these rapid changes in direction as a twinkling or flickering effect. Planets, being closer to us, appear less \"twinkly\" because their light comes from a larger area, averaging out the effects of atmospheric turbulence.\n\n**Final Answer (d):** The twinkling of stars is caused by the bending of starlight due to atmospheric turbulence, leading to apparent fluctuations in brightness.\n\n\n\n\n Let me know if you have any other physics puzzles you'd like to explore!\n"}

Can such a tube be used to distinguish between two photons whose energies differ by 50%?\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "Here's a breakdown of how a photomultiplier tube (PMT) works, followed by an analysis of its ability to differentiate photon energy differences:\n\n**How a Photomultiplier Tube Works:**\n\n1. **Photon Entry:** A single photon strikes the PMT's photosensitive surface, typically made of a material like alkali metal or semiconductor. This interaction causes the ejection of a single electron—a process called the photoelectric effect.\n\n2. **Electron Multiplication:** The emitted electron is accelerated towards a series of dynodes (electrodes with progressively higher positive voltages).  As it passes each dynode, it collides with atoms within the dynode material, causing them to release secondary electrons. Each secondary electron then undergoes similar collisions, leading to an avalanche-like multiplication of electrons.\n\n3. **Signal Amplification:** The cascade of electron releases results in a large number of electrons reaching the anode, which acts as the output terminal. This amplified electron current can be measured and correlated back to the original incident photon.\n\n4. **Output Signal:** The magnitude of the output signal is proportional to the number of electrons collected at the anode, effectively amplifying the initial photon detection event.\n\n\n**Can a PMT Distinguish Between Photons with Different Energies?**\n\nThe short answer is **no**, not directly. Here's why:\n\n* **Energy Conversion:** PMTs primarily function based on detecting *the presence* of a photon, not its specific energy. The key mechanism is the photoelectric effect, where any photon with sufficient energy above the work function of the material will eject an electron.\n\n* **Linear Response:** While the number of electrons released increases proportionally to the intensity of light (and thus indirectly related to photon flux), there isn't a direct one-to-one mapping between individual photon energy and the resulting electron count.\n\n**Indirect Energy Discrimination:**\n\nWhile a single PMT cannot directly measure energy differences, some indirect methods exist:\n\n* **Multiple PMTs:** Using multiple PMTs with different thresholds could allow for rough discrimination. For example, if one PMT detects only high-energy photons while another detects both low and high, you might infer the presence of a range of energies.\n* **Time Resolution:** If the time difference between detected events is measurable, this could offer clues about energy variations.

This can be accomplished using a combination of lenses or mirrors.\n\n* **Physical Principles:**\n    * **Geometric Optics:** The key principle here is focusing light rays using refraction (lenses) or reflection (mirrors). We aim to converge parallel rays emanating from the source onto a single point, effectively increasing the brightness per unit area.\n    * **Light Intensity:** Light intensity (candle power) is proportional to the amount of light energy passing through a given area per unit time. By concentrating the light, we increase the intensity at the focal point.\n\n* **System Design:**\n    * **Concave Mirror System:** A concave parabolic mirror would be ideal. Its shape ensures that all incoming parallel rays reflect to a single focus point. The larger the curvature radius of the mirror, the wider the input angle it can accept before significant divergence occurs.\n    * **Lens System:** While possible, a multi-element lens system might be more complex due to chromatic aberration (different colors refracting at slightly different angles), requiring careful design and potentially multiple elements to correct this issue.\n\n**(b) Circular Polarization Generator and Analyzer**\n\n* **Description:** This device utilizes the property of polarization – the direction of oscillation of electric field vectors in light waves. Circular polarization refers to a specific type where the electric field rotates in a circle as the wave propagates.\n\n* **Physical Principles:**\n    * **Polarization States:** Light can be linearly polarized (oscillating in one plane), circularly polarized (rotating ellipse), or elliptically polarized (generalized rotation).\n    * **Quarter Wave Plate:** A quarter-wave plate is a birefringent material whose thickness is precisely designed so that it introduces a phase shift of π/2 between the ordinary and extraordinary rays. When used on linearly polarized light, it converts it to circular polarization.\n    * **Half Wave Plate:** A half-wave plate introduces a phase shift of π between the ordinary and extraordinary rays. It can rotate the polarization axis of incident light.\n\n* **System Design:**\n    * **Generator:** Linearly polarized light passes through a quarter-wave plate oriented appropriately to produce right-circularly or left-circularly polarized light.\n    * **Analyzer:** Another quarter-wave plate, rotated relative to the generator, allows us to analyze the handedness (right or left) of the incoming circularly polarized light.\n\n\n**(c) Stellar Size Estimation**\n\n* **Description:** Determining the angular size of a distant star provides information about its actual size. However, directly measuring small angles is challenging.\n\n* **Physical Principles:**\n    * **Diffraction:** When light encounters an obstacle (like a telescope aperture), it spreads out, creating a diffraction pattern. The width of this central bright spot (Airy disk) depends on the wavelength of light and the diameter of the aperture.\n    * **Angular Resolution:** The ability to distinguish two closely spaced objects is limited by diffraction. Smaller apertures have poorer resolution.\n\n* **System Design:**\n    * **Interferometry:** Combining light from multiple telescopes (interferometer) increases the effective aperture size, improving angular resolution. Techniques like Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) use geographically separated antennas to create virtual interferometers with enormous baselines, enabling precise measurements of stellar diameters.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like a deeper dive into any particular aspect!\n"}

This distribution of velocities leads to a spread in the observed wavelengths, resulting in a broadened spectral line.\n\n* **(ii) Natural Line Width:** The natural line width arises from the inherent uncertainty principle limitations on the lifetime of excited states. According to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, there's a fundamental limit to how precisely we can know both the energy and lifetime of a quantum state. A shorter lifetime corresponds to a broader range of possible energies, leading to a wider spectral line.\n\n**Think of it this way:**\n\n* **Doppler Broadening:** Like cars driving past with their horns sounding – some sound higher pitched (blue shift), some lower pitched (red shift) depending on their speed relative to you.\n* **Natural Broadening:** Imagine a flickering light bulb – the color might fluctuate slightly because the light isn't perfectly constant.\n\n\n**(b) Doppler-Free Spectroscopy Experiment**\n\nThe key idea behind Doppler-free spectroscopy is to eliminate the Doppler broadening effect. One common method uses **two-photon absorption**. Here's a simplified description:\n\n1. **Laser Setup:** Two lasers with nearly identical frequencies are used. These lasers interact with the same atomic transition.\n\n2. **Simultaneous Absorption:** An atom absorbs one photon from each laser simultaneously. For this process to occur, the two photons must satisfy specific momentum conservation conditions. Importantly, these conditions don't depend on the atom's velocity.\n\n3. **Eliminating Doppler Shift:** Since the simultaneous absorption requires precise matching of momenta, only atoms with very specific velocities contribute to the signal. Atoms moving too fast won't meet the momentum requirements.\n\n4. **Narrowed Spectrum:** As a result, the measured spectrum becomes much narrower than what would be observed using single-photon absorption, effectively removing the Doppler broadening contribution.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like more details about any particular aspect!\n"}

The bending causes a spreading of the light, leading to blurring of the image.  This effect is described by the Airy disk pattern.\n* **Atmospheric Turbulence:** Earth's atmosphere acts like a constantly moving heat source, causing distortions in the path of starlight. These distortions create shimmering or twinkling effects and further degrade image sharpness.\n\n**On-Axis Resolution**\n\n* **Diffraction Limit:** On-axis, the diffraction limit sets the fundamental resolution. It can be approximated using the following formula:\n\n   Angular Resolution (θ) ≈ 1.22 * λ / D\n\n   where:\n    * θ is the angular resolution (in radians)\n    * λ is the wavelength of light (for visible light, let's take it as ~550 nm = 5.5 x 10^-7 m)\n    * D is the diameter of the aperture (10 cm = 0.1 m)\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n\n   θ ≈ 1.22 * (5.5 x 10^-7 m) / (0.1 m) ≈ 6.7 x 10^-6 radians\n\n* **Image Size:** To get the linear size of the Airy disk (the blurred spot), we multiply the angular resolution by the distance to the object (focal length):\n\n   Linear Size ≈ θ * Focal Length ≈ (6.7 x 10^-6 rad) * (5 m) ≈ 3.4 x 10^-5 m = 0.034 mm\n\n\n**Off-Axis Resolution**\n\nOff-axis, the resolution degrades due to several factors:\n\n* **Spherical Aberration:** A perfect parabola would focus all rays to a single point. However, real mirrors have imperfections, causing some rays to focus slightly away from the ideal point. This becomes more pronounced off-axis.\n* **Astigmatism:** Another imperfection that causes different directions of light to focus at different points, further degrading off-axis resolution.\n\nThese aberrations make the image blurrier and less sharp than on-axis.

It's measured in lumens (lm).  The relationship between luminous flux, intensity (I), and area (A) is:\n\n Φ = I * A\n\n**Step 2: Consider Geometry**\n\n* **Sun as Source:** The sun acts as our point light source. Its rays spread out uniformly in all directions.\n* **Lens Action:** The lens focuses these parallel rays onto a smaller area, effectively concentrating the light. This means the intensity increases while the area decreases.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Initial Flux**\n\nLet the initial luminous flux incident on the flat surface be Φ<sub>initial</sub>. We don't know its exact value, but we can express it in terms of the sun's luminosity (which we also don't know explicitly) and the area of the surface.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Image Area**\n\nThe image formed by the lens will have an area proportional to the square of the ratio of the focal length to the object distance. Since the sun is very far away, we can approximate the object distance as infinity.

Here's a general description:\n\n* **Central Maximum:** Still the brightest region.\n* **Secondary Maxima:** Multiple secondary maxima will appear on either side of the central maximum. However, their intensities will vary depending on the relative phase differences created by the path lengths traveled by light waves from each slit.\n* **Minima:** Darker regions will occur where destructive interference takes place. There will be several sets of minima interspersed between the maxima.\n\n**Calculating the Intensity Distribution:**\n\nTo precisely calculate the intensity distribution, we need to use the concept of superposition and consider the contributions from all three slits. This involves using trigonometric functions and summing up the amplitudes of the individual wavelets emanating from each slit. The result will be a function describing how the intensity varies across the screen.

We need to check for irregularities or \"bumps\" on the surface using interferometry.\n* **Parallelism within 5 seconds of arc:** This refers to the angle between the two surfaces.

This value is approximately 1360 W/m².  We can denote this as *I<sub>sun</sub>*.\n\n* **Image Brightness:** We want to find the brightness of the image formed by the lens, which we'll call *I<sub>image</sub>*.\n\n**2. Consider Lens Properties:**\n\n* **Focal Length:** The focal length (*f*) determines how strongly the lens converges light rays. A shorter focal length means stronger convergence.\n\n* **Area Considerations:** When light passes through a converging lens, it gets focused onto a smaller area called the focal plane.\n\n**3. Apply Geometric Optics:**\n\n* **Similar Triangles:** Imagine two similar triangles: one formed by the Sun, the lens, and the point where the sunlight intersects the focal plane; and another formed by the Sun, the lens, and the center of the lens itself. These similarities allow us to relate distances.\n\n* **Magnification:** The magnification of the lens tells us how much larger or smaller the image appears compared to the object. Since the image forms at the focal plane, the magnification will be equal to the ratio of the focal length to the distance between the Sun and the lens. Let's denote this distance as *d*. So, the magnification is *M = f / d*.\n\n**4. Calculate Image Area:**\n\nThe area of the image projected on the focal plane is related to the area of the Sun and the magnification squared:\n\n* *A<sub>image</sub> = M² * A<sub>sun</sub>*\n\nWhere *A<sub>sun</sub>* is the apparent area of the Sun as seen from Earth.\n\n**5.

We again want the intensity at the point directly behind the center of the hole.\n\nThe key concept here is diffraction – the bending of waves as they pass through an aperture or around an obstacle.

However, the intensity at this point won't be equal to $I_0$ because some light is blocked by the disk.\n\n4. **Approximation:** For $L >> R$, we can use the small angle approximation.

In what way, if any, will this change the emitted radiation? Explain qualitatively.\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "Here's a breakdown of how to approach this problem:\n\n**(a) Frequency Dependence on Direction**\n\n* **Understanding the Phenomenon:** The emission of radiation arises due to the acceleration of the charged particles as they interact with the periodic structure of the grating.  This interaction can be understood through the concept of induced electric dipoles within the metal. As the charged particles pass by, they induce oscillating electric dipoles in the metal atoms. These oscillating dipoles then radiate electromagnetic waves.\n\n* **Diffraction Grating Effect:** The periodicity of the grating acts like a diffraction grating for these radiated waves. This means the intensity of the emitted radiation will vary depending on the angle θ relative to the normal to the grating surface.

This change in speed causes the light to bend, a phenomenon called refraction.  The amount of bending depends on the indices of refraction of the two media.\n* **Doppler Effect for Light:** The Doppler effect applies to all waves, including light. It describes the change in frequency of a wave (light) as the source and observer move relative to each other. For light, if the source and observer are moving closer together, the observed frequency increases (blue shift).

We can decompose this into two orthogonal linearly polarized components: one aligned with the x-axis (let's call it $I_x$) and another aligned with the y-axis ($I_y$).\n\n* **Intensity Transmission Through Linear Analyzer:** A linear polarizer only transmits light whose electric field is parallel to its transmission axis. Therefore:\n    * When the analyzer is along the x-axis, the transmitted intensity is $I_x$. Since we know this is maximum and equal to $1.5I_0$, we have $I_x = 1.5I_0$.\n    * When the analyzer is along the y-axis, the transmitted intensity is $I_y$.

In this case, since the quarter-wave plate axes are aligned with the x and y axes, it will convert any initial elliptical polarization into a specific type of circular polarization.\n\n* **Maximum Intensity Condition:** The fact that the maximum intensity occurs when the analyzer is at 30 degrees suggests that the quarter-wave plate has converted the input light into right-circularly polarized light (or left-circularly polarized light). Right-circularly polarized light will be maximally transmitted by an analyzer oriented at 45 degrees. However, since our maximum intensity occurs at 30 degrees, the light must be left-circularly polarized.\n\n* **Calculating Maximum Intensity:** Let $I_{c}$ represent the intensity of the circularly polarized light after passing through the quarter-wave plate.

The key difference here is the phase shift introduced by the filter on the middle slit. This will affect both the diffraction pattern (due to the individual slit widths) and the interference pattern (due to the path differences between waves from different slits).\n\n**Key Formulas**\n\n* **Diffraction:** For single-slit diffraction, the minima occur at angles given by:\n   $$a \\sin{\\theta} = m \\lambda$$ where *m* is an integer representing the order of the minimum.\n\n* **Interference:** For two interfering waves, constructive interference occurs when the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength:\n    $$d \\sin{\\theta} = m \\lambda$$\n   where *d* is the distance between the slits.

The refractive index of most materials is very close to 1 for X-rays, meaning they don't bend significantly when passing through them. This makes it difficult to focus X-rays using traditional lens designs. Instead, techniques like grazing incidence reflection or focusing crystals are employed.\n\n* **Near 5000 Å:** Glass lenses work well for visible light because the refractive index of glass is substantially different from that of air. This allows for significant bending of light rays, enabling us to create converging and diverging lenses for focusing and manipulating beams.\n\n**(b) Use of Mirrors**\n\n* **Near 100 Å:** Highly polished metal mirrors can be used to reflect X-rays effectively. Due to the high reflectivity of metals at these wavelengths, multiple reflections can be used to achieve focusing. Special coatings may be applied to enhance reflectivity further.\n\n* **Near 5000 Å:** While mirrors can also reflect visible light, their use is less common than lenses. Reflecting surfaces need to be extremely smooth to avoid scattering, which degrades image quality. Additionally, prisms are often preferred for dispersion (separating white light into its constituent colors).\n\n**(c) Chromatic Resolving Power of Gratings of Fixed Width**\n\n* **Near 100 Å:** A grating with a fixed width will have a higher resolving power for X-rays. This is because the shorter wavelength leads to smaller diffraction angles, allowing for finer separation of closely spaced spectral lines.\n\n* **Near 5000 Å:** Grating resolution is lower for visible light due to the longer wavelengths resulting in larger diffraction angles. To achieve comparable resolution, gratings would need to be much wider.\n\n**(d) Minimum Resolvable Angular Separation of an Image-Forming System of Fixed Diameter**\n\n* **Near 100 Å:** An imaging system of fixed diameter will have a smaller minimum resolvable angular separation for X-rays. This is directly related to the Rayleigh criterion, which states that two point sources are just resolved if the center of one diffraction pattern falls on the first minimum of the other. Since the diffraction angle is inversely proportional to wavelength, shorter wavelengths lead to better resolution.\n\n* **Near 5000 Å:** For visible light, the same sized aperture will result in a larger minimum resolvable angular separation due to the longer wavelengths.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions!\n\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)} \\quad \\text{X-rays require specialized methods like grazing incidence}\\\\ &\\qquad \\text{reflection or crystal focusing; Visible light uses lenses.}\\\\\n&\\text{(b)} \\quad \\text{Mirrors are effective for both, but lenses are more common for}\\\\ &\\qquad \\text{visible light.}\\\\\n&\\text{(c)} \\quad \\text{Higher resolving power for X-rays due to shorter wavelengths.}\\\\\n&\\text{(d)} \\quad \\text{Smaller minimum resolvable angular separation for X-rays.}\n\\end{aligned}}\\]"}

This coherence is crucial for constructive and destructive interference patterns to emerge. Secondly, the distance between the sources relative to the wavelength of the wave needs to be significant. If the separation is much smaller than the wavelength, the waves will appear as if coming from a single source, and interference won't be noticeable. Conversely, if the separation is much larger than the wavelength, the individual wavefronts will spread out too much, diminishing the interference effect.
