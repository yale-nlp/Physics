'a' is a constant related to the strength of this interaction.\n\n* **Term 2:** `(|e|/mec) s<sub>e</sub> ⋅ B` describes the **Zeeman splitting** energy of the electron spin in the magnetic field.

However, since muons have a positive charge, their spin aligns *opposite* to the magnetic field direction.\n\nThe dominant term depends on the relative magnitudes of the spin-spin interaction ('a') and the Zeeman splittings.

{"id": "quantum/8007", "solution": "##  Advanced Physics Solutions: WKB Approximation & Atomic Ground State Energy \n\n**(a) Validity Conditions for the WKB Approximation**\n\n\nThe Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method provides an approximate solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation for potentials where the potential varies slowly over distances comparable to the de Broglie wavelength of the particle. Let's derive its validity conditions and analyze its failure near turning points.\n\n1. **Schrödinger Equation:** We start with the time-independent Schrödinger equation:\n\n   $$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2 \\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x)\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x)$$\n\n2. **Wave Function Ansatz:** The WKB approximation assumes a wave function of the form:\n\n   $$\\psi(x) = A e^{\\pm iS(x)/\\hbar}$$\n\n   where $A$ is a constant amplitude and $S(x)$ is a real phase function. This ansatz reflects the idea that the wavefunction oscillates rapidly as it propagates through regions of classically allowed motion and decays exponentially in classically forbidden regions.\n\n3. **Substituting and Simplifying:** Substitute this ansatz into the Schrödinger equation and simplify. You will obtain two equations:\n\n    * One relating the derivative of $S(x)$ to the kinetic and potential energies.\n    * Another involving the second derivative of $S(x)$.\n\n4. **Validity Condition:** The WKB approximation holds well when the following condition is satisfied:\n\n   $$\\left| \\frac{d S(x)}{dx} \\right| >> \\hbar $$\n\n   This means the phase function changes significantly over a distance much smaller than the de Broglie wavelength of the particle. In other words, the potential should vary slowly compared to the characteristic length scale set by the particle's momentum.\n\n5. **Failure Near Turning Points:** At a classical turning point, the particle momentarily comes to rest ($p=0$). Consequently, the slope of the phase function becomes infinite, violating the WKB condition. Therefore, the WKB approximation breaks down in the immediate vicinity of turning points.\n\n\n\n**(b) Perturbation Theory Explanation for Ground State Energy Decrease in Electric Field**\n\nWhen an atom is placed in an external electric field, the Hamiltonian of the system gets modified due to the interaction between the electron charge and the field. This modification acts as a perturbation to the unperturbed atomic Hamiltonian.\n\n1. **Perturbed Hamiltonian:** The perturbation term can be written as:\n\n   $$H' = -eE z$$\n\n   where $e$ is the electron charge, $E$ is the electric field strength, and $z$ is the position coordinate along the direction of the field.\n\n2. **First Order Correction:** Using first-order perturbation theory, we can calculate the correction to the ground state energy:\n\n   $$\\Delta E_0^{(1)} = \\langle \\phi_0 | H' | \\phi_0 \\rangle$$\n\n   Here, $|\\phi_0\\rangle$ represents the unperturbed ground state wavefunction. Since the electric field interacts primarily with the electron's spatial distribution, which extends beyond the nucleus, the expectation value of $H'$ will generally be negative.\n\n3. **Energy Decrease:** As the expectation value of $H'$ is negative, the first-order correction to the ground state energy is also negative. This implies that the ground state energy of the atom *decreases* when placed in an external electric field.\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, placing an atom in an external electric field lowers its ground state energy due to the attractive interaction between the negatively charged electrons and the positive field.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or would like more details on specific steps!\n", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

Let's analyze its symmetries:\n\n* **Translation Symmetry:** The Hamiltonian is invariant under simultaneous translation of both particles. This means if we shift both $\\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\\mathbf{r}_2$ by the same vector, the equation remains unchanged. Therefore, there is translational symmetry in both spatial directions (x, y, z).\n\n* **Rotation Symmetry:** The potential only depends on the relative distance between the particles, not their individual positions. This implies rotational invariance. Shifting the entire coordinate system while keeping the relative distances fixed doesn't change the potential.\n\n* **Permutation Symmetry:** Swapping the labels of the two particles leaves the potential unchanged.

Understand Nuclear Spin and its Effect:**\n\n* Nitrogen-14 nuclei have a nuclear spin quantum number *I* = 1, meaning they possess an intrinsic angular momentum.  This leads to different possible orientations of their magnetic moments within the molecule.\n\n* Since N₂ is homonuclear (both nuclei are identical), there are two possible relative orientations of the nuclear spins: parallel (spin up on both nuclei) or antiparallel (one spin up, one spin down). These states are called \"ortho\" and \"para\" states respectively.\n\n**2. Molecular Rotational Energy Levels:**\n\n* The energy levels of a diatomic molecule like N₂ depend on its rotational quantum number *J*, which determines the total angular momentum of the molecule.\n\n* For molecules with non-zero nuclear spin, the rotational energy levels are further split due to the interaction between the nuclear spins and the molecular rotation. This splitting is known as hyperfine structure.\n\n**3. Selection Rules:**\n\n* Transitions between rotational energy levels occur when the molecule absorbs or emits radiation corresponding to the energy difference between the levels.\n\n* **Selection rule:** ΔJ = ±1. This means only transitions where the rotational quantum number changes by +1 or -1 are allowed.\n\n**4. Intensity Ratios:**\n\n* The intensity of a spectral line depends on the population of the initial state from which the transition occurs.\n\n* In thermal equilibrium, the populations of ortho and para states are related by Boltzmann statistics. At room temperature, the ortho state is more populated than the para state because it corresponds to lower energy.\n\n\n* Due to this population difference, transitions originating from the ortho state will be more intense than those originating from the para state.\n\n\n\n**5. Calculating the Ratio:**\n\nThe exact ratio of intensities for adjacent rotational lines depends on several factors, including the specific values of J involved and the temperature.

We need to use this information to relate states with a specific magnetic quantum number ($m=l-1/2$) to states described in terms of individual spin and orbital angular momenta ($|l, m_l; s, m_s\\rangle$).\n\n**Key Concepts**\n\n* **Angular Momentum Operators:**  The total angular momentum operator is denoted as  $\\mathbf{J}$ and has components $J_x$, $J_y$, and $J_z$. The square of the total angular momentum is $\\mathbf{J}^2$.\n* **Raising and Lowering Operators:** These operators, $J_+ = J_x + iJ_y$ and $J_- = J_x - iJ_y$, increase or decrease the magnetic quantum number ($m$) of an angular momentum eigenstate.\n* **Eigenvalues:** Eigenstates of an operator have definite values (eigenvalues) when measured. For example, $|j, m\\rangle$ represents an eigenstate of $\\mathbf{J}^2$ with eigenvalue $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$ and $J_z$ with eigenvalue $\\hbar m$.\n* **Spin Angular Momentum:** Spin angular momentum is quantized and associated with intrinsic angular momentum. It has its own set of operators and eigenstates. A particle with spin $s$ has possible magnetic quantum numbers for spin ranging from $-s$ to $+s$.\n\n\n**Solution**\n\n1. **Relate Total Angular Momentum to Orbital and Spin Angular Momenta:** In this case, we are dealing with a system where the total angular momentum arises from both orbital angular momentum ($\\mathbf{L}$) and spin angular momentum ($\\mathbf{S}$). Therefore, we have:\n\n   $$\\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{L} + \\mathbf{S}$$\n\n2. **Consider the Given Information:** We know that $m = l - 1/2$. This means the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum is related to the magnetic quantum numbers of the orbital and spin angular momenta. Let's denote the magnetic quantum numbers for orbital and spin as $m_l$ and $m_s$, respectively. Then:\n\n   $$m = m_l + m_s = l - 1/2$$\n\n3. **Use Raising and Lowering Operators:** Since the problem asks us to express the state $|j, m\\rangle$ in terms of $|l, m_l; s, m_s\\rangle$, we can try using the raising and lowering operators to manipulate the state until it matches the desired form. However, without more specific information about the relationship between $j$ and $l$, and the allowed values of $m_l$ and $m_s$, it's difficult to proceed further.\n\n\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nWithout additional constraints on $j$, $l$, and the allowed combinations of $m_l$ and $m_s$, we cannot definitively express the state $|j, m\\rangle$ with $m = l - 1/2$ solely in terms of $|l, m_l; s, m_s\\rangle$.

Apply Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\n\n* The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two fermions (like electrons) can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. Since both electrons in helium occupy the same orbital but with opposite spins, their total orbital angular momentum is also zero.\n\n**4. Determine Total Angular Momentum:**\n\n* The total angular momentum (J) of an atom is the vector sum of its orbital angular momentum (L) and spin angular momentum (S). In this case, L = 0 and S = 0, so J = 0.\n\n**5. Relate Angular Momentum to Magnetic Moment:**\n\n* An atom's magnetic moment (μ) is proportional to its total angular momentum: μ = γJ, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\n**6.

They dictate which transitions are allowed based on changes in the quantum numbers associated with the electronic states. \n\n* **Δl = ±1:** The orbital angular momentum quantum number (l) can change by +1 or -1. This means that a transition can occur between states with l=0 to l=1, l=1 to l=2, etc., but not directly between states with the same l value.\n* **Δm<sub>l</sub> = 0, ±1:** The magnetic quantum number (m<sub>l</sub>) can change by 0, +1, or -1. This reflects the fact that photons carry angular momentum along their direction of propagation.\n* **ΔS = 0:** The total spin angular momentum quantum number (S) remains unchanged during the transition.\n\n\n**(b) Interpretation in Terms of Photon Properties**\n\nLet's break down how these selection rules relate to photon properties:\n\n* **Orbital Angular Momentum:** The Δl = ±1 rule arises because the interaction between the oscillating electric dipole moment of the atom and the electromagnetic field of the photon involves exchange of one unit of angular momentum. Photons have intrinsic orbital angular momentum given by |l|ħ, so they must transfer this amount to the atom.\n\n* **Spin:** Since ΔS = 0, both the initial and final atomic states have the same spin multiplicity.\n\n* **Helicity:** Helicity refers to the projection of the photon's spin angular momentum along its direction of motion. It can be either +1 (right-circularly polarized) or -1 (left-circularly polarized). The selection rules imply that only specific combinations of photon helicity and atomic orbital angular momentum lead to allowed transitions. For example, a right-circularly polarized photon can excite an electron from an s state (l=0) to a p state (l=1) if m<sub>l</sub> changes by +1.\n\n* **Parity:** Parity relates to the behavior of wavefunctions under spatial inversion. A system has even parity if it remains unchanged upon reflection through the origin, while odd parity implies a sign change.

In the Bohr model, this energy difference is given by:\n   $$E_{2p} = -\\frac{me^4}{8\\epsilon_0^2 h^2 n^2}$$\n   where *n* = 2 for the 2p state.\n\n4. **Express everything in terms of known constants:** Substitute the expressions for P and E<sub>2p</sub> into the equation for τ and simplify.

Understanding the Born Approximation**\n\nThe Born approximation is a method used in quantum mechanics to calculate scattering amplitudes (and hence cross sections) when the interaction potential between particles is weak.

{"id": "quantum/5037", "solution": "Here's a breakdown of why excited states of hydrogen exhibit a linear Stark effect while those of sodium display a quadratic one:\n\n**Understanding the Stark Effect**\n\nThe Stark effect describes the shift in energy levels of atoms or molecules when placed in an external electric field.  This shift arises from the interaction between the electric field and the atom's electron cloud. \n\n* **Linear Stark Effect:** A linear Stark effect means that the energy level shift is directly proportional to the strength of the applied electric field (E). This occurs when the wavefunction describing the electronic state has a non-zero dipole moment.\n\n* **Quadratic Stark Effect:** A quadratic Stark effect means the energy level shift is proportional to the square of the electric field strength (E²). This happens when the initial wavefunction doesn't have a permanent dipole moment. The electric field induces a temporary dipole moment, leading to this squared dependence.\n\n**Hydrogen vs. Sodium**\n\n1. **Atomic Structure:**\n\n   * **Hydrogen:** Hydrogen has a single electron orbiting a proton. Its ground state wavefunction (1s) is spherically symmetric, meaning it has no inherent dipole moment. However, when excited to higher energy levels (like 2p), the electron distribution becomes more asymmetric, resulting in a non-zero dipole moment.\n\n   * **Sodium:** Sodium has a [Ne]3s¹ configuration.

Even in excited states, the dominant configurations often involve orbitals with some degree of symmetry, preventing a significant permanent dipole moment.\n\n2. **Electric Field Interaction:**\n\n   * **Hydrogen Excited States:** When an electric field is applied to an excited hydrogen atom, the asymmetry in the electron distribution interacts strongly with the field. This leads to a direct shift in energy levels proportional to E, causing a linear Stark effect.\n\n   * **Sodium Excited States:** While sodium's excited states might experience some distortion due to the electric field, their overall symmetry remains relatively preserved.

{"id": "Quantum Mechanics/26-1", "solution": "Here's a breakdown of the solutions:\n\n**(a) Central Field Approximation**\n\n* **Definition:** The central field approximation simplifies the many-body problem of interacting electrons in an atom by assuming that each electron moves independently in an average potential created by all other electrons. This potential acts like a spherically symmetric \"central\" field around the nucleus.  \n\n* **Why it Works (Leading Order):** While not perfectly accurate, this approximation works well because:\n    * Electrons spend most of their time far from the nucleus where interactions between them become weaker due to the inverse square law.\n    * The spherical symmetry averages out some of the more complex interactions.\n\n* **Quantum Numbers:** To leading order, the central field approximation allows us to treat each electron as if it were orbiting the nucleus individually. This leads to the familiar set of quantum numbers:\n    * **n (Principal Quantum Number):** Determines the energy level of the electron (shell). Higher *n* means higher energy and larger orbital size.\n    * **ℓ (Angular Momentum or Azimuthal Quantum Number):** Defines the shape of the electron's orbital (subshell). It ranges from 0 to n-1, corresponding to s, p, d, f orbitals, etc.\n    * **m<sub>ℓ</sub> (Magnetic Quantum Number):** Specifies the orientation of the orbital in space. It ranges from -ℓ to +ℓ.\n    * **m<sub>s</sub> (Spin Quantum Number):** Describes the intrinsic angular momentum of the electron, which can be either +½ (spin up) or -½ (spin down).\n\n   The combination of these four quantum numbers uniquely describes the state of a single electron within the central field approximation.\n\n\n**(b) Periodicity of the Periodic Table**\n\n* **Diagram:** [Insert a simple diagram here showing the first four periods of the periodic table with squares representing each element.]\n\n* **Explanation:** The periodicity arises directly from the filling of electron shells and subshells according to the Aufbau principle. As we move across a period, the number of protons in the nucleus increases, increasing the positive charge attracting electrons. This generally leads to electrons being added to the same principal shell (*n*) but different subshells (*ℓ*). When a new subshell fills completely, we start a new period.\n\n* **Filling Lowest ℓ States First:** Within a given shell, electrons preferentially occupy lower values of *ℓ*. This is because lower *ℓ* corresponds to lower energy levels.\n\n\n\n**(c) LS Coupling Scheme**\n\n* **LS Coupling:** In the LS coupling scheme, we consider the total orbital angular momentum (L) and total spin angular momentum (S) of a group of electrons before combining them into a total angular momentum J.\n\n* **Quantum Numbers:**\n    * L (Total Orbital Angular Momentum): Ranges from 0 to N-1, where N is the number of electrons involved. Each value corresponds to a specific term symbol (e.g., S, P, D, F).\n    * S (Total Spin Angular Momentum): Ranges from 0 to N/2, where N is the number of electrons involved.\n    * J (Total Angular Momentum): Ranges from |L-S| to L+S.\n\n* **Carbon (Z=6)**\n    1. **Electron Configuration:** 1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>2</sup>\n    2. **Possible Terms:** Carbon has two unpaired electrons in its 2p subshell. We have:\n        * Total spin S = 1 (parallel spins)\n        * Total spin S = 0 (antiparallel spins)\n        * Possible combinations of L (P state) lead to:\n            * ³P (L=1, S=1)\n            * ¹D (L=2, S=0)\n    3. **Ground State:** The ground state of carbon is ³P.

The Photoelectric Effect:**\n\n* **Experiment Description:** In this experiment, light shines on a metal surface, and electrons are emitted from the metal (the photoelectric effect). Key parameters include:\n    * **Frequency (ν):** Of the incident light.\n    * **Intensity (I):** Of the incident light (related to the number of photons per unit area per second).\n    * **Kinetic Energy (KE):** Of the ejected electrons.\n    * **Work Function (Φ):** A material property representing the minimum energy required to remove an electron from its surface.\n\n* **Classical Prediction:** Classical wave theory predicted that:\n    * Increasing intensity should increase KE of electrons proportionally.\n    * Any frequency above zero should cause electron emission, with higher frequencies leading to higher KE.\n\n* **Experimental Observations:**\n    * Electrons are only emitted for frequencies *above a threshold value*, called the cutoff frequency (ν₀). Below this frequency, no matter how intense the light is, no electrons are emitted. This contradicts classical predictions.\n    * The KE of emitted electrons depends linearly on the *frequency* of the light, not its intensity. Higher frequency means higher KE, regardless of intensity.\n\n* **Quantum Explanation:** Einstein explained these observations by proposing that light exists in discrete packets of energy called photons. Each photon carries energy E = hν, where h is Planck's constant. When a photon strikes the metal, it transfers all its energy to a single electron. If the photon's energy exceeds the work function (E ≥ Φ), the electron is emitted with kinetic energy:\n\n   \\[KE_{max} = hν - Φ\\]\n\nThis equation beautifully explains both the threshold frequency and the linear dependence of KE on frequency.\n\n\n**2. Blackbody Radiation Spectrum:**\n\n* **Experiment Description:** A blackbody is an idealized object that absorbs all electromagnetic radiation incident upon it and emits radiation based solely on its temperature. Measuring the spectral distribution of this emitted radiation reveals characteristic patterns.\n\n* **Classical Prediction:** Classical physics failed to accurately predict the observed spectrum. It predicted that the intensity of emitted radiation would increase infinitely at shorter wavelengths (ultraviolet catastrophe).\n\n* **Experimental Observations:** The actual spectrum showed a peak intensity at a specific wavelength depending on the temperature, followed by a rapid decrease towards shorter wavelengths.\n\n* **Quantum Explanation:** Max Planck proposed that the energy of oscillators within the blackbody could only take on discrete values proportional to their frequency:\n\n   \\[E = nhν\\]\n\nwhere n is an integer (n=1, 2, 3,...). This idea introduced the concept of quantization of energy. By incorporating this quantization into his calculations, Planck successfully derived the correct blackbody radiation spectrum.\n\n\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\nBoth the photoelectric effect and blackbody radiation demonstrated that energy is not continuous but comes in discrete packets (quanta).

{"id": "Quantum Mechanics/26-2", "solution": "Here's how to determine the term symbols for the ground states of the first ten elements:\n\n**Understanding Term Symbols**\n\nA term symbol is a shorthand notation that describes the electronic state of an atom. It provides information about:\n\n* **Total orbital angular momentum (L):** Represented by letters S, P, D, F... corresponding to L = 0, 1, 2, 3,... respectively.\n* **Total spin angular momentum (S):**  Represented numerically (e.g., S=1/2, S=1).\n* **Multiplicity:**  Calculated as 2S + 1. This indicates the number of possible spin orientations.\n\nThe general form of a term symbol is: ²S+1LJ\n\nwhere J is the total angular momentum quantum number (J = |L-S|, |L-S| + 1,..., L+S)\n\n**Step-by-step Determination**\n\n1. **Electron Configuration:** Determine the electron configuration of each element using the Aufbau principle and Hund's rules.\n\n2. **Identify Orbitals:** Identify the filled orbitals contributing to the valence shell. Remember that electrons fill orbitals with parallel spins before pairing up (Hund's rule).\n\n3. **Calculate L:** Sum the individual orbital angular momenta (l values) of the unpaired electrons. For example:\n    * s orbital: l = 0\n    * p orbital: l = 1\n    * d orbital: l = 2\n    * f orbital: l = 3\n\n4. **Calculate S:** Sum the individual spin angular momenta (ms values) of the unpaired electrons. Each electron has ms = +1/2 or -1/2.\n\n5. **Calculate J:** Calculate all possible values of J using the formula J = |L-S|, |L-S| + 1,..., L+S. The lowest value of J usually corresponds to the ground state.\n\n6. **Write the Term Symbol:** Assemble the term symbol using the calculated values of multiplicity (2S+1), L, and J.\n\n\n**Ground State Term Symbols for First Ten Elements:**\n\n1. **Hydrogen (H):** [He] 1s¹ → ¹S₀\n2. **Helium (He):** [He] 1s² → ¹S₀\n3. **Lithium (Li):** [He] 2s¹ → ²S₁/₂\n4. **Beryllium (Be):** [He] 2s² → ¹S₀\n5. **Boron (B):** [He] 2s² 2p¹ → ²P₁/₂\n6. **Carbon (C):** [He] 2s² 2p² → ³P₀, ³P₁, ³P₂\n7. **Nitrogen (N):** [He] 2s² 2p³ → ⁴S₁/₂, ⁴P₃/₂ , ⁴P₁/₂ , ⁴P₀\n8. **Oxygen (O):** [He] 2s² 2p⁴ → ³P₂ , ³P₁ , ³P₀\n9. **Fluorine (F):** [He] 2s² 2p⁵ → ²P₃/₂ , ²P₁/₂\n10. **Neon (Ne):** [He] 2s² 2p⁶ → ¹S₀\n\n\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{H}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{He}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{Li}: {}^2S_{1/2} \\\\\n&\\text{Be}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{B}: {}^2P_{1/2} \\\\\n&\\text{C}: {}^3P_0, {}^3P_1, {}^3P_2\\\\\n&\\text{N}: {}^4S_{1/2}, {}^4P_{3/2}, {}^4P_{1/2}, {}^4P_0\\\\\n&\\text{O}: {}^3P_2, {}^3P_1, {}^3P_0\\\\\n&\\text{F}: {}^2P_{3/2}, {}^2P_{1/2}\\\\\n&\\text{Ne}: {}^1S_0\n\\end{aligned}}\\]\n\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{H}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{He}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{Li}: {}^2S_{1/2} \\\\\n&\\text{Be}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{B}: {}^2P_{1/2} \\\\\n&\\text{C}: {}^3P_0, {}^3P_1, {}^3P_2\\\\\n&\\text{N}: {}^4S_{1/2}, {}^4P_{3/2}, {}^4P_{1/2}, {}^4P_0\\\\\n&\\text{O}: {}^3P_2, {}^3P_1, {}^3P_0\\\\\n&\\text{F}: {}^2P_{3/2}, {}^2P_{1/2}\\\\\n&\\text{Ne}: {}^1S_0\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{H}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{He}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{Li}: {}^2S_{1/2} \\\\\n&\\text{Be}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{B}: {}^2P_{1/2} \\\\\n&\\text{C}: {}^3P_0, {}^3P_1, {}^3P_2\\\\\n&\\text{N}: {}^4S_{1/2}, {}^4P_{3/2}, {}^4P_{1/2}, {}^4P_0\\\\\n&\\text{O}: {}^3P_2, {}^3P_1, {}^3P_0\\\\\n&\\text{F}: {}^2P_{3/2}, {}^2P_{1/2}\\\\\n&\\text{Ne}: {}^1S_0\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{H: } {}^2S_{1/2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{H}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{He}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{Li}: {}^2S_{1/2} \\\\\n&\\text{Be}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{B}: {}^2P_{1/2} \\\\\n&\\text{C}: {}^3P_0, {}^3P_1, {}^3P_2\\\\\n&\\text{N}: {}^4S_{1/2}, {}^4P_{3/2}, {}^4P_{1/2}, {}^4P_0\\\\\n&\\text{O}: {}^3P_2, {}^3P_1, {}^3P_0\\\\\n&\\text{F}: {}^2P_{3/2}, {}^2P_{1/2}\\\\\n&\\text{Ne}: {}^1S_0\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{He: } {}^1S_0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{H}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{He}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{Li}: {}^2S_{1/2} \\\\\n&\\text{Be}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{B}: {}^2P_{1/2} \\\\\n&\\text{C}: {}^3P_0, {}^3P_1, {}^3P_2\\\\\n&\\text{N}: {}^4S_{1/2}, {}^4P_{3/2}, {}^4P_{1/2}, {}^4P_0\\\\\n&\\text{O}: {}^3P_2, {}^3P_1, {}^3P_0\\\\\n&\\text{F}: {}^2P_{3/2}, {}^2P_{1/2}\\\\\n&\\text{Ne}: {}^1S_0\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{Li: } {}^2S_{1/2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{H}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{He}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{Li}: {}^2S_{1/2} \\\\\n&\\text{Be}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{B}: {}^2P_{1/2} \\\\\n&\\text{C}: {}^3P_0, {}^3P_1, {}^3P_2\\\\\n&\\text{N}: {}^4S_{1/2}, {}^4P_{3/2}, {}^4P_{1/2}, {}^4P_0\\\\\n&\\text{O}: {}^3P_2, {}^3P_1, {}^3P_0\\\\\n&\\text{F}: {}^2P_{3/2}, {}^2P_{1/2}\\\\\n&\\text{Ne}: {}^1S_0\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{Be: } {}^1S_0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{H}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{He}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{Li}: {}^2S_{1/2} \\\\\n&\\text{Be}: {}^1S_0 \\\\\n&\\text{B}: {}^2P_{1/2} \\\\\n&\\text{C}: {}^3P_0, {}^3P_1, {}^3P_2\\\\\n&\\text{N}: {}^4S_{1/2}, {}^4P_{3/2}, {}^4P_{1/2}, {}^4P_0\\\\\n&\\text{O}: {}^3P_2, {}^3P_1, {}^3P_0\\\\\n&\\text{F}: {}^2P_{3/2}, {}^2P_{1/2}\\\\\n&\\text{Ne}: {}^1S_0\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{B: } {}^2P_{1/2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
