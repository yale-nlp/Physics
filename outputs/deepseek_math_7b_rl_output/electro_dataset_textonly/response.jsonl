If you think about it clearly most of the magnetic field lines produced by every small segment located near the outer parts of the solenoid cross the solenoid's surface exactly once before going to the next such segment. However, the magnetic field lines produced by segments nearer to the center of the solenoid cross the surface twice -once entering and once leaving. Thus, there will not be any net magnetic field inside the solenoid because the magnetic field due to these two sets of field lines cancel each other out. But since your observation point lies way closer than the dimensions of the solenoid then almost entire magnetic field is confined strictly inside the solenoid and therefore neglecting some fringe effects one could say whole magnetic field has crossed the surface just once giving rise counterencircled currrent equal NI thus yielding same formula derived earlier!"}

A \"real\" conductor will always distribute charges over its outer surfaces until it reaches equilibrium where all internal fields equal zero meaning any excess electron added via induction/ polarization effects due do influence exerted upon them ,will migrate entirely to those areas most exposed outwardly hence resulting typically negative regions near earth ground point & positive region facing said imposed force ... This means if one were able somehow forcibly place differing amounts densities onto specific localized segments along cylindrical structure's lengthwise direction while maintaining overall electroneutrality there would be no observable effect other than redistribution amongst various patches . On contrary insulators like PVC won‚Äôt readily shift around embedded protons /electrons without applying high degrees heat energy causing dissociation thus allowing net polarity buildup ..

Therefore ans would remain **zero** even if œÉ varied non-linearly wth applied voltage V or any other parameter!! Answer comes Out to Be [Zero]The value K does not affect anything about how much resistance exists across these conductors because changing k only changes relationship btwn sigma n E but still they both vary linearly ..so den their ratio remains same nd thus resistivity doesn;t change"}

For our problem consider concentric cylindrical Gaussian surface with r as its Radius . As it encloses only one wire carrying i=qv for total time t = L/(velocity v ) so : $$‚àÆbdl$$ becomes BL or just simply $$\\mu _o qL / (\\pi R^2)$$ because each loop has circumference equal to C=\\(\\frac {perimeter}{length}\\)=$$\\Pi D/\\lamba =\\Pai*D*\\lambda ^{-1}$$and from ampre law every turn will produce flux density b=$¬µoi /\\($$\\pari *d)$$(or Biot savart‚ÄôS LAW ).

So now looking back againt original equation curl$(E)= -\\overrightarrow {dB}/dt$, taking divergence both sides gives us div$(\\text{curl}(E))= ‚àídiv (\\dfrac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}} dB)$.

Now using Ampere‚Äô Law relating magnetics&electricity like below :$$\\oint _S ŒºH‚ãÖdl=\\int\\!\\!\\!\\int_A Js‚ãÖda$$ We get after some manipulation following result wich basically says how much magentic flux changes per unit area will induce certain amount electrical potential difference across concerned region...i think you already know what follows next :-). The motional emf around loop formed closed path encircling entire spherical shell must equal line integral taken along circle having circumference same length sph erical boundary thus giving rise finally well known Lorentz force relation between velocities etcetera ..which when equated correctly leads exactly formularized version found earlier involving divergences gradients curls all those terms mentioned before .In other words one could say these steps lead directly towards finding desired quantity namely said Surface Charge Density denoted symbolically œÉ ,since rest follow straightforwardly afterwards once initial setup done right !

Therefore when we bring charged particles into such region no force acts upon them except coulombic ones due only those points where they're outside sphere i..e.,infinity or just near point(center). So all you need do find out potential difference between these two regions using formula $\\Delta V = -\\int_{r_1}^{ r _2} \\vec E\\cdot d{\\vec s}$ . Here since magnitude &direction both changes w/respect position so better use numerical method like integration etc but here notice one thing : Electric Field lines radially outward hence angle bwn vector ds nd radial displacement 'dr'(small change n distance )is 0 thus making dot product easy as multiplication itself !

When you change this insulator from something like vacuum/air which has Œµ=1to another substance whereŒµis different then obviously there will be changes because these materials affecthow easily electric fields can pass through them! In equation form if U have parallel plate capacitor formula Q=(Eo*A)/d but here E becomes Edielctric so its becomeQ =(epsilon * A / d ) . Now since C was originally defined as ratio Of Charge Stored On Plates Over Voltage Across Them i e Capacitance c equals q over v , If We increase 'q'(charge stored), voltage also increases proportionally hence maintaining same ration still gives us original value for Capcitiance !! So basically filling up one side doesn‚Äôt effect things happeningonotherside .. Hence NewCapacitor Will Be Same As Old One That Is Just \"c\" !!!!! Answer would simply b√©$\\boxed{}$"}

{"id": "Electricity and Magenetism/6-2", "questions": "It may have occurred to you that since parallel currents attract, the current within a single wire should contract into a tiny concentrated stream along the axis. Yet in practice the current typically distributes itself quite uniformly over the wire. How do you account for this? If the positive charges (density œÅ<sub>+</sub>) are at rest, and the negative charges (density œÅ<sub>-</sub>) move at speed v (and none of these depends on the distance from the axis), show that œÅ<sub>-</sub> = -Œ≥¬≤œÅ<sub>+</sub>, where$\\gamma=1 / \\sqrt{1-(v / c)^2}$ and c¬≤ = 1/Œº<sub>0</sub>œµ<sub>0</sub>. If the wire as a whole is neutral, where is the compensating charge located? [Notice that for typical velocities, the two charge densities are essentially unchanged by the current (since Œ≥ ‚âà 1). In plasmas, however, where the positive charges are also free to move, this so-called pinch effect can be very significant.]", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": " The fact remains true even when we consider relativity because it's derived using basic principles like conservation laws which don‚Äôt change with special theory or general theories if they follow those rules only! So let us proceed further without worrying about relativistic effects too much right now(we will come back later!). We know total electric field inside conductor must add up exactly zero i..e no net force acts upon any charged particle there hence all +ve chages pushed towards one side while equal amount get accumulated onto other making them appear negatively due balance requirement keeping system electrically balanced overall maintaining electrostatics condition . This means some external agency has done work here but once equilibrium reached ,no more energy required therefore electrostatic conditions prevail throughout process ! Now coming down mathematical part : Let say linear dimension shrinks upto $L$ then new volume would become $\\frac{\\pi R^2 L}{\\gamma ^2}$. As number electrons doesn t vary thus implying both cases hold same electron count remember ? Thus old density times original vol equals New denisty time new Volume implies ${\\rho}_{new} =\\frac{{\\rho}}{\\gamma^{2}}$. But neutrality demands sum of postive & negatives shud bero ie ${ {\\rho}_{+}}_{new}+ {{\\rho}_{-}}_{new}= {-\\left(\\dfrac{{ -\\rho }}{{\\gamma}^{2}}\\right) }_{old}\\implies\\Rightarrow$. Since magnitude comes out different than previous value indicating redistribution across length direction causing compression bringing protons closer together forming positively ionised plasma core known commonly among astrophysicists astrosphere community etcetera‚Ä¶QED"}
