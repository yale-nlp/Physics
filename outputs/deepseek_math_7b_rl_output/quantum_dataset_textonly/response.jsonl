Here' s my attempt :   \nCase:(A). Distinguishable Particles i.e Bosons & Fermions :- Since these types can be distinguished then they must have distinct sets if quantum nos hence no symmetrization / antisymmetrisation process involved ..! So all individual eigenstates can form combined eigenstates without any regard to indistinguishability ! We simply use the notation $$\\Psi_{total}=\\psi(x_1)\\psi(x_2)|S_1,m_{S1}\\rangle|S_2,m_{S2}\\rangle $$ where $|S_i,m_{Si}\\rangle$'s represent the spins eigenkets while keeping space parts separated out explicitly !! Now comes the task of working out allowed combinations given the energy level scheme provided above.:- As per the Pauli Exclusion Principle only two fermions could occupy the lower of the two energy levels whilst the higher level would contain just one fermion since only that many can exist in a state according to it‚Äôs definition preventing two fermions from sharing the same set of quantum numbers simultaneously!! If instead were bosons ALL 4 bosons could share those two energy levels since they are now considered indistinguishable so obey the bosonic enhancement principle allowing more particles fill up a given state than either fermions or distinguishable particles‚Ä¶.(B)..Indistinguishable spin -1/2 Particles (Fermions):- This case will involve symmetrization / anti-symmetrization processes due to indistinguisha bility thus making the overall wave function either even or odd under permutation of the two particles governed by whether you employ symmetric o r antisymmetric forms respectively....The general form for the combined wavefunction accounting for both position x AND spin S variables is given by Slater Determinants for fermions but we shall not go into mathematical details over here except to say that ONLY the spatial parts will be affected by said symmetrization / antisymmetrization leaving the spin parts untouched because they depend only on the individual particle spins and not positions !! Thus our combined wavefunctions now take the form;$$\\Psi_{Total}=N[\\psi_a(x_1)\\psi_b(x_2)+\\psi_b(x_1)\\psi_a(x_2)] |\\!\\uparrow \\downarrow\\rangle \\\\or\\\\ N[\\psi_a(x_1)\\psi_b(x_2)-\\psi_b(x_1)\\psi_a(x_2)] |\\!\\uparrow \\downarrow\\rangle .$$ Where \\(N\\) represents normalization constant ensuring the wavefuntion is normalized w.r.t the entire system including both position X AND spin S variables ... And yes I know the arrows indicate the direction of electron spins though strictly speaking that language is obsolete theoretically having been replaced by talking about spin z-components +1/2 or -1/2 along with corresponding kets rather than representing specific directions in space although the latter formalism remains useful pedagogically especially for beginners who find abstract spin z-components difficult to grasp straightaway !!! Finally coming back full circle onto your original question itemized requested answers Case-(C)...Identical spinless particles:- These truly areBosonsthus obeying the rule whereby any number may occupy ANY energy level despite there being TWO particles in the system owing to their sameness leading to enhanced occupancy in accordance with BE statistics principles applied to identical particles ....Thus combining the Spatial and spin parts straightforwardly via simple multiplication yields;- Œ®_(Total)=œà‚Çê(x‚±Ω)œà·µ¶(x‚ÇÅ ) ; OR ;Œ® _(To tal)=œàÀ¢ ô‚Å∫¬π·¥π«ªÀãX‚ÇÇ); Or ;∆üÃ≤(_Tota l)=(œáŒ±)(œÜŒ≤)+ (œá Œ≤ )( œÜ Œ± ); All the Best !!"}

We have to couple $(l=1; s=\\frac{1}{2})$ such that total spin is either $(\\frac {3} {2}, -\\frac {3} {2}), (\\frac {3} {2},-\\frac {1} {2})$. For part A), only one possibility exists as given there : $| j= \\tfrac {3} {2}; \\; m =\\tfrac {3} {2}\\rangle \\, =\\, | l=1;\\; s=\\tfrac {1} {2}\\rangle $ . This gives us our first coefficient equal oone i..e ${(\\tfrac {3} {2},\\,\\tfrac {3} {2})|}(1,\\,\\tfrac {1} {2})={1}$. Now let's find other missing ones needed using above mentioned resource site etc... Thus another important clebsch gordon rule of negative sign comes into play when you change the order so now your equation changes like this $(-)\\times(-)=+$ then it becomes easy $$|\\tfrac {3} {2},\\, \\tfrac {1} {2}\\rangle=\\, -|1,\\, 1\\rangle |\\tfrac {1} {2},\\, -\\tfrac {1} {2}\\rangle.$$ So value turns out be $-{\\sqrt {\\tfrac {1} {2}}}$. Hence both parts get normalized properly wihout any further calculation since all others will give zero due to orthogonality principle between different eigenstates having diffent eigenvalues wrt same operator say Hamiltonian H eigenstate property $[H,|jm\\rangle=E|jm\\rangle$.Now coming back do reaction stuff ... First note isospin has no spatial component thus Kp->Sigma pi simply mean coupling of initial Isospin 1/2 and 1 giving total isospin 1 or 0. Since question asks for rate based on conserved quantity thus only resonant state of isospin 1 can take place leaving out option D which has I=0 case left undone! Clearly C part follows almost similar lines albeit with swapped spins i.e., now its $1/2$and $1$ coupled to give $1$(again) Total isospin.Thus again applying rules of cgc enlisted earlier u would arrive at following result :- $$\\langle 1,\\; 1\\; ;\\;\\tfrac {1} {2},\\, -\\tfrac {1} {2}|K^-\\, p\\rangle=-\\sqrt {2}.$$ Again normallzation issue resolved automatically via orthogonal properties of eigenstates."}

These electron states have quantized energies because their motion inside the material has been restricted through Bragg scattering off the atomic cores forming the structure.[1]  This restriction causes some allowed electronic \"orbits\" while other orbits become forbidden as per Pauli's exclusion principle which prevents more than two electrons from occupying same state with opposite spins[2][3], thus creating distinct regions where no electrons exist known commonly for semiconductors & insulators respectively(energy gap) .The width between adjacent levels decreases exponentially until it reaches zero; this phenomenon creates continuous ranges rather discrete individual orbitals resulting into what we call Energy Bands instead!

{"id": "quantum/8028", "questions": "It is generally recognized that there are at least three different kinds of neutrinos. They can be distinguished by the reactions in which the neutrinos are created or absorbed. Let us call these three types of neutrino $\\nu_e, \\nu_\\mu$ and $\\nu_\\tau$. It has been speculated that each of the neutrinos has a small but finite rest mass, possibly different for each type. Let us suppose, for this exam question, that there is a small perturbing interaction between these neutrino types, in the absence of which all three types have the same nonzero rest mass $ M_0 $. Let the matrix element of this perturbation have the same real value $\\hbar \\omega_1$ between each pair of neutrino types. Let it have zero expectation value in each of the states $\\nu_e, \\nu_\\mu$ and $\\nu_\\tau$.\n\n(a) A neutrino of type $\\nu_e$ is produced at rest at time zero. What is the probability, as a function of time, that the neutrino will be in each of the other two states?\n\n(b) [Can be answered independently of (a)] An experiment to detect these neutrino oscillations is being performed. The flight path of the neutrinos is 2000 meters. Their energy is 100 $\\text{GeV}$. The sensitivity is such that the presence of 1% of neutrinos of one type different from that produced at the start of the flight path can be measured with confidence.

In context presented question however doesn‚Äòt require any further elaboration beyond already provided outline nor does calculation itself turn too complex either hence I shall now move onto next topic‚Ä¶.."}

An electron orbiting around nucleus would be such example because while moving on circular path ,it experiences centripetal acceleration towards center due attraction force between them which makes this motion non uniform as per newton laws so according maxwell equation charges under go accelerating motions produce EM wave thus making emission continuous not discrete like we observe with atomic spectra! This issue lead Niel Bohr propose his model where he assumed quantized orbits but still couldn; t explain why only certain frequencies were emitted when electrons jumped down energy levels.. Then came quantum mechanics through Schrodinger Equation & Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle etc., These theories provided better understanding about subatomic particles including their behavior within nuclei leading us closer toward accurate predictions regarding spectral lines produced during electronic transitions inside isolated neutral Atoms/Ions without involving external forces(like fields) acting upon those systems ! The key difference here lies mainly into how these two periods approached problems rather than actual nature itself since both Classical Electromagnetics&Quantum Mechanic try describe same reality albeit using different mathematical tools respectively giving rise similar results yet based entirely distinct premises hence justifying need separate treatment depending context being considered!. As far goes question asking what causes exited state Atom s To Emit Light ? Well once again It all comes back full circle : According Postulates Of QM if system initially prepared i n Excited State then time evolution will cause probability amplitude associated wth some specific set Observable values become nonzero over course long enough duration allowing measurement made thereupon yield result corresponding particular eigenvalue belonging said observable quantity accordingly resulting observed outcome corresponds directly photon Emission process taking place ..
