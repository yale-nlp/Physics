{"id": "statistics/1-9", "solution": " To solve this problem we will use partial derivatives extensively so let's start off recalling what they represent from calculus class; if z is some function ƒ(x , y), then $\\dfrac {\\delta f }{\\delta x}$ represents how much 'z changes when only \"x\" increases', keeping all other variables fixed i..e its just like differentiating w/ respect to `x` but treating everything else as constants! The same logic applies here too where $(\\tfrac{\\partial ...}{\\partial...})_X means differentiate wrt whatever inside brackets while holding X value fix during differentiation process\". Now lets get started on part A : Given equation was already provided which says $$dQ= dU+dW.$$ We know well enough now about internal energies etc., hence can write it down more explicitly using our new notation system used throughout these notes thusly:\"\"$C_{P}- C_{V}= (\\text {change In } Q)_{pressure}(\\Delta P)=0+(\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial T})_{Pressure}.$Now work done formula comes out be definition itself:$W=\\intop Fdx.$Here force would simply become Pressure times Area($PA$) since thats exactly Force=$F$= PA . Hence change becomes$\\oint op pdV,$which gives us second half required quantity needed namely$(\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial t})_{Pres}$.

{"id": "statistics/1-13", "solution": " To find out how much energy can be used as useful (external) work when expanding or compressing gases under different conditions we need to look into some thermodynamic concepts such entropy change ($\\Delta S$), enthalpy ($H$) , internal enery($U$).  The first law states that $\\delta Q = d U + \\delta W$, where $Q$ represents thermal transfer between system & environment(heat), while $-W$= mechanical/work done on surroundings; here \"d\" denotes infinitesimal changes . When volume expands against atmospheric presssure then pexdV=-dW' so above equation becomes :$\\delta q=du+pexdv$. Enthalphy H defined through:$h\\equiv u+pv$; hence du=(dh-pdv).

This makes them useful because they give us direct readings without needing calibration curves unlike most liquid filled ones do; also being able todo so over wide ranges means less frequent recalibration required too! A further advantage comes from their ability not only topickup very small differences but even tiny fluctuations due mainlyto thermal noise generated within materials themselves during operation - something difficultfor anyother type device tryingtoperformthis task successfullywithout sufferingfrom significant errors causedby external factors affecting performance significantlyover time periods longerthan those neededforthe given application(s)..

So now let us find out how much extra volume was created when air mass moved from inner part towards outer curved portion while increasing its size? Well initially there were no such thing like \"extra\"volume but after increase they came into existence only because our system has expanded! And if you think about infinitesimally small steps then every time some new space would have been added having dimensions dx * dy *(dz+dn), here n tends to zero...so basically very close packed layers one upon another with thickness tending to infinitesimal value..now coming back , amount gained or lost during change depends solely dependson differencein volumes ! so initial had none [rememberwe started w/o any term called EXTRA]and finally ended upwith something[that what i said above!] well thats exactly increment ..or decrease whatever u wanna call....So lets denote dv=\"change In Volume\".

{"id": "statistics/2-152", "solution": " The reason why even with such close proximity between electrons, their collisions have relatively large distances to travel without colliding again can be attributed mainly due two factors; quantum effects as well phase space restrictions on available states that they may collide into or scatter from during motion through material medium like metals under consideration here.. As per Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle which says \"the product $\\Delta x\\cdotp m_{\\text {particle }}\\geq h/(2π)$ where Δ𝑥 represents uncertainty/spread around position coordinate axis while moving along trajectory & mass denoted via symbol 'm_ particle\" implies greater certainty about momentum transfer(or scattering) means shorter distance before next encounter takes place! This essentially limits how closely particles approach one another thus reducing chances /probability associated wth intermolecular interactions leading us back towards original premise regarding longer than expected separations observed experimentally when compared against calculated values based upon classical mechanics alone .. Additionally ,another contributing factor comes forth once we consider concept known popularly referred too often times simply put forward rather loosely but effectively enough : Pauli Exclusion principle . It basically suggests no more then TWO fermions could possibly occupy same Quantum state simultaneously meaning if multiple Electrons were very near each other within metallic lattice structure described above some would need necessarily possess different spins hence increasing likelihood those nearby charges sharing similar kinetic energies might indeed interact indirectly thru intermediary photons instead depending solely purely classically determined spatial relationships amongst them !

In our setup upper surface U initially had temp ${T}_{upper}= {T}_u$; lower boundry condition set by system designer says L will have fixed but unknown now variable value i.e.,${T}_{lower}\\equiv ({T }_{L})=constant<{T}_{up}>$. So basically outward radiative powers going outwards would be : $$P_{outgoingfromaboveplate\\Rightarrow }={A}.\\sigma .{(T )}_{Upper}^{4}$$and$$ P_{{OutGoingFromBelowPlate}}={\\sigma}. {(T)}_{Lower}^4.$$Now obviously difference Qinflow=(Difference OutgoingRadiation)$=(\\Delta )\\Rightarrow {\\delta }{Q}_{\\text{InFlow}}={{({p}_{Upward}- p_{\\downarrow})}}$or rearranging further gives $$\\Longrightarrow {{\\delta}}{{{q}}}_{inflow}={\\sigma.[}{{({t}}_{UP})^{4}}-(({ t}_{LOW})^4)]}.$$So far so good?!
