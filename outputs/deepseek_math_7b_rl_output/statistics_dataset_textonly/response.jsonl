Sixty calories of heat are added to the system. The total volume is kept constant. Calculate to within 2% the masses of ice, water, and water vapor now present in the container. Justify your answers.\n\n(Hint: For water at $0.01°C$, the latent heat of fusion is 80 cal/g, the latent heat of vaporization is 596 cal/g, and the latent heat of sublimation is 676 cal/g.

Now let us assume x grams of Ice has converted into vapour so remaining ice would be $(1-x)$ while there won’t be any chnage in Liquid Water content since its boiling point hasn;t reached yet only saturated steam above water with certain mass y formed during whole heating process upto given conditions... So applying conservation of Energy [since no work done] : $$\\Delta Q = L_sx+L_gy$$ where \\(L_s\\) denotes specific latent heat of Sublimation wich is equivalent to \\(L_sub.=676\\frac{cal}{g}\\) & similarly\\(L_v=\\frac{{c al}}{g}\\). Plugging values gives you following equation after simplifying $$60=(676)(X)+(596y)$$ ...(A) We also know Volume is conserved thus if Vi refers to Initial volme of everything inside e.g. sum of volumes of ice, liqiud water and vapour then Final Volume VF must refer to same ref referred to as volume of Steam only (Why? because volume occupied by water is ignorable in comparision to steam ) Mathematically speaking when x gm of ice sublimes it converts into x gm of vapour therefore mass of vapours becomes X+(Y - x)..

", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": " To find out how much energy can be used as useful (external) work when expanding or compressing gases under different conditions we need to look into some thermodynamic concepts such entropy change ($\\Delta S$), enthalpy ($H$) , internal enery($U$).  The first law states that $\\delta Q = d U + \\delta W$, where $Q$ represents thermal transfer between system & environment(heat), while $-W$= mechanical/work done on surroundings; here \"d\" denotes infinitesimal changes . When volume expands against atmospheric presssure then pexdV=-dW' so above equation becomes :$\\delta q=du+pexdv$. Enthalphy H defined through:$h\\equiv u+pv$; hence du=(dh-pdv). So our earlier eqn now reads:\"TdS=C_vdT+(RdT)/(\\gamma -1)\" ;where Cp& CV denote molar specific heats @constant Pressures v respevtively.. Also gamma =(cpcv)^(-1)..

This makes them useful because they give us direct readings without needing calibration curves unlike most liquid filled ones do; also being able todo so over wide ranges means less frequent recalibration required too! A further advantage comes from their ability not only topickup very small differences but even tiny fluctuations due mainlyto thermal noise generated within materials themselves during operation - something difficultfor anyother type device tryingtoperformthis task successfullywithout sufferingfrom significant errors causedby external factors affecting performance significantlyover time periods longerthan those neededforthe given application(s).. On another note though.. They aren’t portable enough sometimes since bulky tanks containing pressurized gasses might make transportation tricky depending upon how much space/weight restrictions exist beforehand ..

Again Differentiating Gibbs free energy G=$U+PV−TS$:with respecttomatterdensityρwhile holding Entropy('’$) Fixed gives us:- ($P+\\Delta_{pressure})(dv)_{{{},}_ext}-vd\\rho-\\delta _{temperature}(dT)=0$.
