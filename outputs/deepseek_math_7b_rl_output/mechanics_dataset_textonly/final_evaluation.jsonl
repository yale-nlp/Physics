The 'action' $$S$$ is defined as \\[ S = \\int_{t_i}^{t_f} L \\, dt \\] where `\\(L\\)` denotes the \"Lagrangian\" given by kinetic energy minus potential energy (\\(T-V\\)). For our purposes, let positions be specified by generalized coordinates $$\\mathbf{q} = (q_1,...,q_n)$$ then the kinetic energy is given by\\[ T = \\frac{1}{2} M_{ij}\\dot{q}_i\\dot{q}_j\\]where summation convention has been used ($M_{ij}$ being the symmetric mass matrix),and similarly the potential energy takes the form\\[ V= V(\\mathbf{q}).\\]Lagrange's equation follows for each coordinate via variation of the action:\\[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L }{\\partial \\dot{q}_i }\\right)-\\frac{\\partial L }{ \\partial q_i }=0.\\]For more details see any classical mechanics textbook such as Goldstein et al.(Part $\\textit{(a)}$): To find th emoment o f i nertia Iof abeamofradiusRanda uniform density\\[\\rho=\\dfrac {m}{{pi R^{2}}}\\]with respecttoanaxisperpendiculartothebeamthroughthesamecenterC ,weuseformulausedinpart$\\text {(ii)}$.Thedistancefromtheelementtodescribedby$r,\\phi$,isthedistancefro m C .Thus :I =\\iint _{D}( x ^{2}+ y ^{2}) {\\rm d}A Where D denotestheregionenclosedwithintheringformedwhenarayisrotatedthroughangle œÜ aroundpointCareferenceoriginO As,$ r varies between zero And Ris &œÜvariesbetweenzeroAnd$.Hence ,\\[dA=(rdrd\\varphi ) ;also,( x^{2}=y^{=}rcos^{\\wedge}Œ∏rsinv)^{\\wedge}{} Œ∏=>œÅ‚à´_{{}}^{{}R}_{Œø}drŒô‚ÇÇœÄœÅŒøœÉœÖŒΩ¬≤v+sin·µídv =>p‚Ö± ≥À£‚ÇÄ‚Åª¬π·¥æcosu¬≤udus + p¬≥Œπ sinucos ud u s·ªënd Sinceintegrating cosinesquaredoveroneperiodgives œÄ /two ndsimilarsine squared givesnoresult,[Onlyorsquaretermscontribute], Thus ,[lettinguv dv du vdu ] :-[[email protected]]@5mm {{3}} mm{{Figure}}{{6}}.8 Integrationregionforproblem${4}$.

An Earlier theories were those based upon Newton mechanics where Absolute space & time existed but later experiments like Michelson Morley interferometer showed null result thus disproving these concepts !

{"id": "mechanics/1_79", "solution": " The Law of Conservation of Energy states that \"energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only change forms.\" In this case however we have observed something which seems contrary - two sources producing sound waves with no resultant amplitude (and hence lower total Intensity) than when each source was played separately! This apparent violation appears due our misunderstanding about how interference works between coherent wavefronts like those produced from musical instruments such as tuning forks etc.. When multiple waves meet head-on they may destructively interfere resulting into reduced overall Amplitude/Intensity compared individually added up values but without violating any fundamental physical principle here since these phenomena occur because both individual contributions were already present before meeting together i.e., there wasn't creation nor destruction happening just redistribution within space itself!.
