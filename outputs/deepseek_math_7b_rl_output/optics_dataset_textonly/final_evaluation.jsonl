For light passing through or around apertures (like holes), it's possible under some conditions not only diffract but also interfere with itself constructively - creating bright spots where you wouldn’t expect them! The shape of these interference patterns depends on how far away from our original point source they form; specifically if there were multiple paths between us & whatever object emitted those photons originally had different lengths then waves could arrive outof phase causing destructive/constructive interferences which lead directly into diffraction pattern formation seen when looking thru small openings like slits etc.. One way mathematicians describe such situations involves considering concentric circles centered upon said emitter called 'zones'. Each successive zone has twice as much extra distance travelled compared against its predecessor thus accounting nicely bothforour increased radius ANDthe additional path length due solely thereto .

{"id": "optics/2-31", "solution": " (Note that this problem requires knowledge about diffraction patterns, which may not be covered in all high school curricula.) In optics, when monochromatic light passes through or around an aperture whose size is comparable to its wavelength, it will diffract into a pattern behind the aperture due to wave nature of light; specifically here we consider Fresnel's approximation where distances involved ($R$, source-aperture separation/distance between sources etc., should much larger than wavelengths). For simplicity let us assume unit amplitude incident plane waves coming perpendicularly towards our system so $|\\psi_{inc}|^2=1$; then Fraunhofer far field complex electric field after going though / being diffracted off such apertures can still written via scalar diffraction theory [Goodman]as follows $$\\Psi(\\rho, \\phi)=A\\iint_{\\text{aperture}} d\\sigma e^{-ik\\rho'\\cdot\\cos(\\theta)}U(\\rho') $$where A some constant,$k=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$is wavenumber ,$\\vec{\\rho}'=(x',y')$and observation angle $(\\theta,\\phi)$are related to integration variablevia simple geometry relation i.e.$$\\cos\\theta =\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{f}\\right)^2}\\approx 1-\\frac{\\rho^2}{2f^2}$$if paraxial approximations holds ($\\rho<\\!\\!<f$) .

The required angle is given as θ=$${λ}/{d}$$ where d represents diameter . Now ,we need find out value for 'D'. We know D*f=(Focal length) f_obj * F#_(objective)=constant; here I am assuming it constant because both lenses will move simultaneously towards their respective focal points during focusing operation without changing relative position between them.(This assumption might not hold good when working under different conditions like atmospheric turbulence etc.) So now using above relation $$ {θ}*{R}_{moon}={( λ)}/{({π}{D}/{{4}})}$$; solving further gives us ${Diameter}\\approxeq {{8m}}$. This seems too big but remember there was no constraint mentioned about size limitations so far!Now coming back into real world scenario which does take such huge telescopes then what should replace? Well instead considering single dish type setup why don’t try something more feasible rather than going crazy over gigantic structures!! That thing comes up pretty handy indeed -yes array concept !! Here each individual unit acts independently while collectively they work handinhand providing better results compared earlier proposal involving only giant monolithic structure capable enough handling those enormous dimensions…So basically idea behind incorporating multiple units lies within making system adaptive against external factors causing degradation/deformation due various reasons including natural calamities & man made disasters alike !Coming toward second part i..e choosing suitable values needed put forth following formula derived already before namely sinΦ =(n+½)*wavelength / slit separation ; setting n equal zero yields minima location wrt central maximum thus giving expression Sinφmin=[¼]∗〖Wavelength/(slit seperation )or simply S≈[ Wavelenth]/ [Angular widht ] Plugging numbers yield s~=~[{5 x10^(-7)}] m ~={widthof slits}.

In optics terms though it usually just describes how much light enters your system - larger numbers mean less incoming photons per unit time which results from smaller apertures relative size compared against other things such fixed distances away etc... Now let us consider our scenario here involving moving around objects near cameras often referred too loosely but accurately enough when talking about photography called depth offield .

Let us now address these one after another :   \\\\\\\\\n$\\textbf{(Part A)}$\\\\\\\\ As per given information , we have electron / proton traveling through space close vicinity towards such planar structure called as \"Diffractive Grid\" . Now since according classical theory due passage presence nearby structured surfaces leads generation new form Electromagnetic wave known also under Bragg Scattering Phenomenon where constructive Interference takes place between two reflected beams diffracted off opposite sides wavetrain producing observable peak intensity values corresponding specific angles defined upon interplanar distance present within said lattice arrangement... Thus mathematically speaking Frequency($\\nu$) can be expressed using following relation derived directly based Braggs Law which states $\\sin\\theta = \\frac{n.\\lambda}{D}$ ; here n=order number integer value representing particular spectral line being observed while D represents Spacing Between Adjacent Planes & lambda wavelength associated respective color band detected during experiment.\\\\ So rearranging above equation yields :- $$\\Rightarrow v=\\cfrac { c }{ (\\dfrac {(m*wavelength)}{spacing}) } $$ thus clearly seen variation indeed exists depending both m&Spacing factor but not dependent explicitly angle theta rather indirectly via Wavelength term ! Therefore conclusion drawn would read something along lines:\"Frequency Of Emission Depends On Direction But Not Directly Proportional To It\". This result holds true regardless whether Material used was metal vs nonmetal type medium! Hence no difference there .. just underlying Physics principle remains intact despite choice chosen !!

{"id": "optics/2-79", "solution": " The Malus' Law states that when a polarized light passes through another polarization filter, its amplitude (and therefore also it’s energy) will be reduced according $I = I_o \\cos^2\\theta$, where $\\theta$ represents angle between their transmission axes; Io stands for initial luminous flux density while Ι denotes remaining one after passing though second sheet . In this case we have four sheets , all rotated relative from previous ones just about same value - namely thirty degrees counterclockwise ! This means first & last would make zero degree or rather parallel orientation whereas two middle filters possess tilt difference equivalent exactly ninety-degree separation therebetween! Thusly if initially full quantity(1 unit )of incoming ray has gone via both ends then what comes outnother extreme equals cos²θ= Cos³⁰˚*Cos60̊ *CοS₃₀ʳ which works Out To roughly :$\\frac{λ}{4}$ as follows $$\\left(\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2*\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2} \\right)*\\left(\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)=$$$$\\dfrac {3/4}{2}*{3/4}=\\dfrac{9}{32}=approx.\\lambda /4.$$So basically only quarter portion gets thru such system..

{"id": "optics/2-5", "solution": " For part $(a)$, here's how you can sketch or draw your own diagram for this problem, which will look like double-slit diffraction but without any reference to individual slit widths/heights since they aren’t given explicitly as variables! The x axis represents position on either side ($+$ve rightward; $-$ ve leftwards), while y shows relative brightness levels due mainly because our eyes perceive colors based upon their luminance values rather than absolute intensities alone - hence why graphs often show things normalized wrt some standard value such kA^2k where A stands symbolically speaking...for amplitude). At each location there should be peaks & troughs representing constructive / destructive interferences respectively depending primarily only whether path differences between waves reaching those

{"id": "optics/2-25", "solution": " Interference is a wave phenomenon that occurs when waves overlap each other such that their amplitudes add constructively (reinforcing) or destructively (cancelling). In order for humans to observe this effect visually through our eyes as color patterns on surfaces we perceive with sight; it requires three key components present simultaneously within those specific wavelengths being interfered upon reaching us from various sources along different paths before arriving together again here near where they meet up once more behind some sort-of barrier separating them apart initially due only temporarily until finally coming back into contact later somewhere else nearby afterwards forming these colorful images seen every day around everywhere including right inside ourselves too! But how does allthis work exactly?

{"id": "optics/2-76", "solution": " (a) Lenses can be used for both short wavelength like X rays or gamma ray to long wave length light such infrared radiation . But they have different properties due their nature i e dispersion ,chromatic aberration etc.. For example a lens made up from crown glass will focus visible red better than violet because it has higher refractive index but if we use flint glasses then situation gets reversed so that its focuses more on blue rather green color... So there is no universal rule applicable here.... In case when you talk about diffraction limit which comes into picture while dealing wth small aperture telescope/microscope objective ...here again size matters lot ..i mean larger apertures helps us

{"id": "optics/3-10", "solution": " A Photomultiplier Tube (PMT) is a device that converts light into electrical signals, which can then be processed or recorded for further analysis of information contained within it like images from cameras etc.. The working principle behind this process involves three main steps namely; photoemission , electron multiplication & detection . When visible/UV rays fall on photocathode material(usually made up selenium), electrons get emitted due its high work function value making them free particles inside vacuum envelope containing electrodes called dynodes each having positive potential w r t previous one thus attracting these freed e-s towards anode wire getting amplified as current pulse signal after passing through amplifier circuit connected externally .. Now coming onto our second part whether we could differentiate bw twos photon with energy diffrence being only half i think ans would definitely depend upon various factors including type o f PMTs sensitivity range dynamic ranges noise levels involved during experimentations but generally speaking if difference lies well above threshold level set according design parameters should not cause any problem while identifying individual quanta rather than registering single entity carrying sum total both their kinetic eneriges !!
