{"id": "atomic/2-1", "questions": "Discuss 4 independent arguments against electrons existing inside the nucleus.\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": " Here, I will discuss four main reasons why it is generally believed that electron cannot exist within a proton or neutron of atomic nuclei based on our current understanding about subatomic particles' properties :  1) Size argument - The size issue can be one such reason for not considering existence possibility because if we consider them to coexist then there must have been some interaction between these two entities which would lead into change (or deformation/fracture )in their sizes . Now , as per experimental results protons & neutrons appear much larger than any known elementary particle like leptons(like Electron). This difference could range from factor ~20-35 orders depending upon various models used.(Ref:- https://en.wikipedia...uclear_size ). So this clearly shows us they wonât mix with each other without changing themselves drastically..    Also another important point here should also noted down i sthat even If somehow those conditions were met still due t otheir electrical charges being equal but opposite(+ve charge n both cases), coulomb force acting b etween 'em wouldn make things highly unstable making way too less time period before decay happens thus rendering coexistence impossible !!     In conclusion according To present day knowledge its inconceivable thought process coexisting together under normal circumstances....     \rThe second Argument :- High energy required condition For pair production Of course! Another good enough arguement comes out when you see how easy task was turning creation off just needs comparatively very low amount O fenergy while creating pairs requires huge amounts so high energetic processes taking place only during nuclear reactions etcâ¦which makes living systems unable create large numbers unless extreme environmental changes take places.....       Thirdly; Quantum mechanical issues related With spin quantum number As far research goes all fundamental fermions follow special set rules called Fermi Dirac statistics w hich states no more thn Two identical fermions cna occupy same state simultaneously having half integer spins ..Now since Electrons possess unit value Spin whereas Protons&neutons carry zero values therefore mixing up violate basic laws governing nature itself leading towards system collapse ...        Last But Not Least Energy loss through radiation When u talk About bound Systems containing charged constituents moving around constantly emit electromagnetic radiations hence continuous decrements occur until eventually falling apart completely losing binding energies alongwith causing instability problematically affecting overall stability structure ....This case becomes worse once paired Up whith similar entity carrying Similar Charge again leaving little room left fo rany kind bonding formation.......So above mentioned Arguments pretty convincingly describe Reasons behind refuting idea presence Inside Atomic Nuclei"}

We know that Energy=(Mass defect)*cÂ² or E=ÎMcÂ² where Îm is the difference in invariant mass before and after the reaction. Since most of the mass comes from the \"binding\" of the nucleons to each other, rather than their rest mass, conservation of momentum does NOT require the fragments to have equal and opposite momenta; instead, it is the conservation of the total angular momentum which determines this, and this is often zero in practice, leading to the simpler result that the fragment masses are determined mainly by the binding energy considerations. Thus one may use the known values of the binding energy per nucleon Îµ(A) versus A curve to estimate the approximate value of Q using Einsteinâs famous equation above whenever particle masses are involved! To find out what happens here let us first define some variables : Let mU denote original Mass , then its equivalent Binding Energy according EB=ÎµÃAm_{ U } . Now similarly If mA denotes Final Product #1 having atomic weight/mass number 'a',and similar notation applies too XBâYC+ZD{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {X} _{B}\\rightarrow \\mathrm {Y} _{C}+\\mathrm {Z} _{D}}for product#2 ;then again corresponding BE relations apply i.e., ECâcA & ED*cD respectively !!

To find out more specifically though requires using quantum mechanics which leads one towards partial wave analysis techniques such as those used within Particle Physics experiments involving high energy particle beams colliding head-on against target atoms/nuclei etc...

Estimate roughly in electron volts the energy release per reaction and give the characteristic of nuclear forces most important in these reactions.", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": " Thermonuclear Reactions refer to a type of process where two or more atomic nuclei fuse together under extreme heat (i.e., high temperature) conditions leading into one single larger nucleus with emission(s), usually neutrons but sometimes protons as well; this is also known colloquially simply \"nuclear fission\". The term 'thermo' refers specifically hereto thermal agitation which drives such processes while '-nuclear\" implies that they occur within atoms themselves rather than between them like classical chemistry would allow for instead! In other words it describes how small bits come together when heated up enough so tightly close proximity allows strong attractive force called gravity take over from electromagnetic repulsion keeping parts apart initially due mainly because mass/energy equivalence principle holds true even inside tiny particles making things stick despite initial push away being much stronger electrically speaking compared against gravitational pull trying keep everything separate again once combined already formed bigger structure altogether now less massive hence lower overall binding energies involved

How energetic need a proton be to be above threshold for this reaction?\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": " The problem consists three parts which we will solve one after another; however I'll only give you hints on how each part should proceed due their complexity nature respectively . For all constant values please consult your textbook or online resource like Wikipedia as needed since they might not have been defined explicitly here itself :\nPart $(A)$: To find kinetic Energy required , first calculate time dilation using given proper lifetime ($t_o$)and Lorentz factor ($\\Gamma$). Then use total relativistic energy($ E=mc^{2}\\Gamma $) minus rest mass energy i.e.,$( mc^{2} - m_{rest} c^{2})$ equals Kinetic Energy where necessary conversions from MeV/C$^{2 }$to Joule etc needs careful handling keeping track of significant figures during calculations.(Answer:$7\\times {10}^{-12}\\,Joule$.)   [Hint: Use Time Dilation formula $$ t = \\frac{t_o}{\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{v}{c}\\right)^2}} $$,wherein putting $ v=\\sqrt{\\frac{(KE+ moc^2)}{mo}}$]    Part B): Magnetic force acting upon charged particle moving inside uniform static magentic fiedl having angle theta between velocity vector V and Field vector Bo would be F=qVBoSinTheta ; Here charge q=+Ze considering Z proton number & e electronic charge unit. After calculating Force then deflection Y could be found via integration of small ds whose magnitude comes out to be dy=[F*dt]/mass ; integrate over limits 0 to T seconds wher T is time taken by particke while travelling distance equal yo radius R of curvature of path followed in magnetic field .Finally do second integration limit being observed angel turned by projectile say phi wherein Sinphi=Y/R turns out proportional to Energy E under assumption electric filed component parallel to Earth Surface negligible.. At last express sinPhi in terms fo variables stated there and simplify algebraic expression obtained finally expressing result solely interms oif observable parameters asked ..[ Hint: Express momentum in term sof known quantities nd make use of circular motion equations centrepetal acceleration = v^2 / R = F/M ] Answer:(5X180)/(9 x pi ) XBoe/(Mc). Finally put numerical value into equation.]     C ):For Reaction go though conservation laws involved especially Conservation of Momentum and Total Energies states therein !! Calculate Q Value!!

What is the relationship of this to the total change in energy? (Assume uniform charge distribution; nuclear radius $= 1.2 \\times 10^{-13} A^{1/3} \\text{ cm}$) ", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": " Let's consider that initially, we have one U-238 ($A =$  238) with Z protons uniformly distributed inside it having its own electric field due to which there exists some potential energy associated within itself because all these positively charged particles repel each other as per Coulomb law but since they cannot escape out from their respective locations hence system has certain amount of stored electrical potential energy known as Electrostatic self energy or Self Energy for short denoted mathematically using symbol E_self . Now if you assume Uranium Nucleus splits symetrically say into two equal fragments namely Ba(Z=56 ,A=149 ) & Kr(Z=78 , A= 97). Then both individually also possess same kind of electroststic self energies let us denote them respectively via symbols :EBa_{Self}&EKr_{self}. So now your net Electric Potential Energy i.e. Total Energy (ETotal) would be sum of those individual Energies plus possibly few extra terms originating from surface tension etc.. But here I am only concerned about coulombic forces so will not go much deep over any such small additional effects like Surface Tension effect on binding energy origins.(you can google more details regarding Finite size corrections&Surface tension effects if interested ). Mathematically speaking we have relation :- $$ {{{{{\\bf{\\text{Total}}}}}}}_{\\textbf{Energy}}= {{}_{B}}{{\\rm{a}}}_{_{\\mathbf{S}}}{}_{{\\mathop{\\rm e}\\nolimits}lf}+~_{{K}}{{r}}^{{ }}_{\\mathop{\\rm s}\\nolimitself}+{\\color{Red}{\\Delta neg\\text{X}-like}}_{\\text{terms}}$$.Now according To BOTH Amaldi & Kroemer type of logic when two charges divided symmetrically then loss in electrostatic energy ÎEsys=-Î(-ve X term)=-[-(+term)-(another +term)]=+{(+ve Term)+(somewhat smaller positive Term)}i.e. Positive quantity always! And This Gain In Electrostatic PE originates From Coulombs Law perspective as larger The Charges get closer together Via Nuclear Symmetry Fission process thus overcoming mutual repulsive force between whole lot of Protons finally leading to overall stability in daughter products compared to parent unstable product ! Thus whenever you see a statement mentioning decrease in Electrical PE automatically know that gain in Strong PE must have occurred simultaneously (As per Conservation Of Energy Principle) making way for Overall Stability!.Coming back to our problem where initial state had one single atom converted into pair of lighter ones ; Loss msay L Esys occurs during this transformation As stated earlier Which results in gains GSEkr & GSElba For KR & BA Respectively after symmetry breakups again conservation of energy demands -L ESYS=GSKB&+GSeBA ..But gains for two stable nuclei surely cant be less than entire lost energy therefore magnitude of losses lESYs>|GKRB+| &+ |GBEA|.Thus clearly Reduction in Initial Electric Field energy was used up in forming Two Stable daughters carrying lesser Electric Potential Energy contents manifesting strong bonding connecting nucleons internally via either Spherical shape OR else via somewhat pear shaped structure depending upon quantum mechanical arguments favouring minimum energy configuration most of time spherical shapes turn out to be favourite geometries thereby explaining majority cases...Hope this helps !!The Relationship wud b Simply expressed By equation:- $$\\boldsymbol{-\\triangle {\\bf{Electric}}{\\space\\text{Field}}{\\space\\text{Energy}}\\equiv {{\\vartriangle}}_{{\\mathop{\\rm Bal}\\nolimits}^{\\prime}}{\\it n}{\\kern 1pt}ergy}$$or$$\\pmb{-L_{{\\mathop{\\rm esy}\\nolimits}}^{\\mathbf{= }}\\left({Gain}_{Kr}+{Gain}_{Ba}\\right)}$$$$\\Rightarrow -\\bigtriangleup Eq=\\pm Q.$$"}

In nuclear reactors such conversions do occur but only under certain circumstances involving extreme temperatures/pressures etc., not something that would happen spontaneously outside those environments due mainly because most forms kinetic energies arenât high enoughto overcome strong forces holding atomic nuclei together which require huge amounts heat generated during fission processes inside these machines before they become possible events! âAâ therefore gives us : $\\mu^- \\rightarrow e^-\\ +\\bar{\\nu}_e\\ +v_Î¼$ .

{"id": "atomic/3-41", "questions": "List the general properties of neutrinos and antineutrinos. What was the physical motivation for the original postulate of the existence of the neutrino? How was the neutrino first directly detected?", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": " The main property that distinguishes a particle from its antiparticle is charge conjugation (C), parity transformation(P) or time reversal symmetry operation.(T). Neutrino has negative helicity while anti-neutrino have positive helicity, which means they move opposite to each other when spinning around their direction vector with same magnitude angular momentum . This implies CP violation as well since C changes sign but P does not change under reflection so if both were equal then there would be no difference between them i.e., identical particles w/o any interaction except gravity! 2nd important thing about these two types; They interact only via weak force meaning strong & electromagnetic forces do nothing on either one due mainly because masslessness makes it hard even though very small compared against rest masses involved during those interactions yet still non zero value exists experimentally determined through various experiments conducted over decades leading up until discovery made possible thanks largely too high energy colliders like Fermi lab where scientists found evidence supporting this idea back into early '60s after many false starts along way towards understanding nature better than ever before now having been confirmed countless times afterwards including latest run done recently called IceCube detector located deep underground near South Pole region collecting tons upon tonnes worth data every day trying figure out what exactly constitutes dark matter component making universe' s composition thusly contributing significantly toward solving some long standing problems within astrophysics field itself without doubt ! As far detection goes initially thought might just come thru observation rather direct method wasnât immediately feasible given current tech limitations however later came round using nuclear reactors producing copious amounts radioactive isotopes such thorium based ones specifically used here being fission process produces lots neutrons flying off course occasionally interacting weakly enough allowing few escape unscathed hence forming detectable signal recorded electronically once registered triggers alarm bells ringing loudly indicating presence indeed something new had happened previously unseen kind phenomenon known heretofore simply referred term \"Neutrino\" derived Greek word neutros autos self neutralizing agent basically referring concept hypothesized earlier predicting elementary subatomic particl"}

From definition microscopics means \"at small scales\" hence relating back directly here would imply looking inwardly inside individual particles themselves rather than entire system considered collectively ie whole group vs particular individuals therein making them distinguishable unlike later case involving macro meaning 'large scale'.

This process accounts about half branchings i.e around ~${{{B}{r}}=({{\\Gamma }_{total}}/2)}$. Hence other possibility would become ${ {{B}{r}}}(other)=( {{\\Gamma }_{tot}}-({{\\Gamma }_{Total}}/2))/{{\\Gamma }_{Tot}}$. As per PDG values totalwidth(${{\\Gamma }_{TOL}}$)for delta resonances comes out from order ($100$-$100 MeV$) therefore taking average value say ${{\\Gamma }_{Avg}}$=$((100)+(-100)/2)$=${{}0}$MEV then putting on equation gives us our desired result ! Thus remaining possibilities come up due electromagnetic transition like dipionic etc..!which goes something along line:$Î´^{++}{\\longrightarrow }{p}+{\\pi ^{+}}+Î³ $. Now coming onto muon case here also similar situation prevails since Muons being unstable lepton will undergo either electron capture OR positron emission according to Lepton universality principle wich leads them invariourly producing neutrino antineutrino pair during said processes AND thus giving rise two main prominent channels namely :- Âµâ»âelectron + Î½_e + Î½Â¯Âµ [Electron Capture] ;OR;\\\\Î¼â»âpositron + Î½_e + Î½_Âµ [Positron Emission]\\\\Now Ï meson having mass MÏ=(1019Mev ) undergoes primarily three types Of Decay Mode suchas:\\\\Î¦->KK*,where KK* denotes strange scalar mesons Sâ(*)(980)\\\\or,\\\\Phi -> Î³ + Î³ ,\\\\Or even stronger decay occurs when Phi goesthrough rare flavor changing neutral current(FCNC): directly goinginto leptons pairs too!: ie;;Photon->{lÂ¹+{ lÂ²}-};\\{li}={e,{Î¼},{Ï}}\\\\$.Finally last but most beautiful jpsi states whose discovery was awarded noble prize recently undergoing EM transitions mostly leading towards photon production followedbyleptonicpairproduction!(depending upon phase space available!)andalso some times weakly interacting quark antiquark pairstoo!.Thus overall picture looks somewhat likethis::JÏ-->photon+(lepton pair)+(quarkantiquark pair)..!!"}

Each type has its own corresponding antiparticle with opposite charges but identical mass as well other intrinsic properties like strangeness etc., so we talk about anti-pion when referring specifically t'he antiparticles associated w/these particles denoted b y ï°Ì + / - & . The pions were first discovered during cosmic ray interactions around World War II through cloud chamber photographs taken under high energy conditions where they appeared due mainly from strong interaction processes involving nucleons(protons&neutrons).The discovery was made independently both here n America nd Europe initially thought them being some sort o muon particle until later studies showed differences especially regarding lifetime values between muons vs those found within nuclear reactions context thus leading us now know today that indeed there exist separate category apart fr om leptons namely mesons containing only quarks! Now letâs move onto discussing how one might go abt determining spn parities for each kind mentioned above along wtih what role played btwn experimenters trying figure this stuff ourâ¦ For all cases below assume non relativistic situation unless otherwise noted since most measurements done back then didn\" involve too much fancy equipment capable handling ultrahigh energies required getting precise results concerning such fundamental entities nature provides !

Explain.\n\n(b) Compare the advantages and disadvantages of the probes mentioned above.\n\n(c) What is your opinion about using photons for this purpose?", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": " (a) The choice of a suitable particle or radiation to use depends on its interaction with matter under investigation; i.e., how it interacts within atomic nuclei determines what information can be obtained from that particular type/energy level photon used . For example , high energy x-rays penetrate deeper into materials than low ones so they may reveal more detailed images but lower energies might give better resolution when looking specifically inside individual atoms themselves because their wavelengths match up well against interatomic spacings etcetera! Therefore careful selection based upon specific requirements must always occur before any experimentation begins otherwise results could either misleadingly overstate findings due lack thereof accuracy caused through improper usage methods employed during tests conducted !
