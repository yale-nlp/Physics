Understanding Lens Combinations:\nWhen dealing with multiple thin lenses placed along a common axis, their combined effect can be described using the formula for effective focal length (\\(f_{eff}\\)):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{d_o} + \\frac{1}{d_i} = \\left(\\sum_j \\frac{n_j}{n_0 f_j}\\right) \\]\n\nHowever, since our goal is simpler here—producing an inverted, virtual image of equal magnitude—we'll use basic principles directly related to single-lens behavior first before combining them.\n\nFor one converging lens producing such conditions would require specific placement where both real and virtual images play roles sequentially or simultaneously via proper spacing between objects/lenses/images.\n\n#### 2. Single Converging Lens Conditions Recapitulation:\nA single converging lens forms an inverted, reduced-size image when the object distance from the lens exceeds twice its focal length (\\( d > 2f \\)). For forming exactly half-sized but still inverted images requires careful positioning beyond this general rule; however, achieving exact inversion and equality needs more complex setups involving pairs effectively cancelling out distortions while maintaining symmetry about optical centers.\n\n#### 3.

\n\\text{Output of a laser} = \\text{Coherent monochromatic light}\n\\]\n\n### Part (c): Operation Principle of FEL\n\nIn contrast with conventional solid-state or gas lasers which rely on specific atomic transitions within materials like crystals or gases, a Free Electron Laser uses relativistic electrons moving through magnetic structures called undulators to produce coherent X-ray/UV/VIS/NIR/MWIR/LWIR beams via self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE).\n\n#### Steps Involved:\n1. **Electrons Accelerated:** High-energy electron bunches are generated using linear accelerators (linacs).\n2. **Undulator Interaction:** These high-speed electrons pass through periodic transverse magnetic field regions known as \"undulators.\" As these electrons move back-and-forth due to Lorentz force induced by alternating magnets, synchrotron radiation occurs.\n3. **Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE)**: Initially random emissions get synchronized into constructive interference patterns leading to amplification along the length of the device until saturation point reached producing highly intense pulses of tunable wavelengths across wide spectrum ranges depending upon design parameters such as beam current density & velocity modulation depth provided by external seeding mechanisms if required beyond SASE mode operation.\n\nEnergy conversion happens when kinetic energy stored in accelerated electrons gets partially transferred during interaction inside undulator sections resulting in photon generation followed by further stimulated emission cascades enhancing overall efficiency towards desired spectral outputs.\n\n### Part (d): Advantage Over Conventional Lasers\n\nOne significant benefit of FEL technology compared to traditional lasers

This occurs when sunlight enters the Earth’s atmosphere and encounters molecules such as nitrogen (\\(N_2\\)) or oxygen (\\(O_2\\)). These particles scatter shorter wavelengths more effectively than longer ones because they interact strongly with photons that have higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths). Since visible light has different colors corresponding to varying wavelengths—blue having one of the shortest among them—it gets scattered much more efficiently compared to other colors like green or especially red. Therefore, during clear days, this effect makes our skies appear predominantly blue from all directions except where the Sun directly illuminates us.\n\n\\[ \\text{Rayleigh Scattering} = I(\\lambda) \\propto \\frac{\\left(k^4 / r^6\\right)}{(1 + k^2r^2)^3}, \\]\nwhere \\(I\\) represents intensity, \\(\\lambda\\) wavelength, \\(k\\) depends on particle size relative to wavelength, and \\(r\\) distance traveled through medium.\n\n### (b) Red Sunset/Sunrise\n\nAt sunrise and sunset, the path length for solar radiation traveling through the Earth's atmosphere increases significantly. As mentioned earlier, short-wavelength components get scattered out early along their journey towards observers; thus only long-wavelengths remain unscattered over large distances. Consequently, what reaches your eyes contains mostly reddish hues which dominate the color perception under those conditions.\n\nThis can be understood using similar concepts related to atmospheric dispersion but focusing particularly on how increased air mass affects spectral distribution:\n- **Long Path Length**: At dawn/dusk, rays pass obliquely through thicker layers of atmosphere leading to greater absorption/scattering losses for blues/greens before reaching viewers' locations.\n- **Selective Absorption/Scattering**: Shorter wavelengths suffer stronger attenuation effects allowing predominance of orange-red tones observed near horizon regions.\n\n### (c) Rainbow Formation\n\nRainbows form via two primary mechanisms involving water droplets acting similarly to tiny prisms:\n\n1. **Refraction** - When white sunlight passes from less dense air into denser water within raindrops, its speed decreases causing bending according to Snell's Law.\n   \\[ n_{air}\\sin(i)=n_{water}\\sin(r), \\]\n   Where \\(i\\) denotes angle of incidence inside air, \\(r\\) refraction angle inside drop, and indices represent refractive properties of respective media.\n\n2. **Internal Reflection & Secondary Refractions**\n    After initial entry point, internal reflection off inner surface sends beam back toward exit face after multiple bounces potentially altering direction further based upon angles maintained throughout cycle until exiting again into open space.\n\nFinally,\n3. **Dispersion Effect** – Each component separates spatially depending on individual dispersive characteristics resulting finally in distinct bands representing full spectrum spread across arc viewed against background clouds/sky.\n\nThese combined actions resultantly produce characteristic circular arcs displaying ordered sequence of ROYGBIV (Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet).\n\n### (e) Twinkling Stars\n\nStarlight appears to twinkle mainly owing to turbulent motions present within earthbound atmospheres disrupting steady paths taken by incoming beams. Key points include:\n\n- Atmospheric Layers Contain Variable Densities Leading To Irregular Light Bending Patterns Over Time Scales Perceived By Human Eye.\n- Rapid Changes In Air Density Cause Intermittent Focusing And Defocussing Of Star Images Causing Apparent Brightness Fluctuations Observed As 'Twinkles'.\n\nIn summary,\n\nFor each case described above, specific interactions between electromagnetic waves comprising light and environmental factors dictate observable outcomes ranging from everyday aesthetics seen daily up close to distant cosmic events witnessed occasionally afar.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) Rayleigh Scattering dominates making skylight bluish;} \\\\\n\\text{(b) Longer travel times favor transmission of red lights;}\\\\ \n\\text{(c) Dispersion causes separation creating colorful arches;} \\\\ \n\\text{(d) Turbulence induces brightness fluctuations perceived as twinkling.}\\\\\n\\end{array}}\n\\]"}

Each dynode has a positive voltage slightly higher than the previous one, causing each electron hitting a dynode to release several secondary electrons—typically around 4-7 per incident electron depending on the specific design.\n3. **Amplification Process:** This process repeats for every subsequent stage until reaching the last electrode known as the anode where all these multiplied charges accumulate and produce a measurable output pulse proportional to the number of original photons detected.\n   \nThe amplification factor depends exponentially with the number of dynode stages; thus even very weak signals like those produced by individual photons become easily observable currents.\n\n### Distinguishing Between Photons Based On Energy Difference:\n\nTo determine whether a PMT could differentiate between two photons differing only in energy by 50%, we need to consider what information about the incoming photons' properties the PMT actually measures directly: primarily just presence/absence leading to charge pulses rather than detailed spectral characteristics unless additional specialized equipment is employed alongside basic operation principles described above.\n\nIn standard configurations without supplementary spectrometric components attached post-detection,\nthe primary response mechanism does not inherently resolve differences based purely upon wavelength/photon energy alone but instead responds uniformly across wide ranges within operational sensitivity limits provided both fall well-above threshold levels required initiating cascade multiplication processes effectively.\n\nHowever, theoretically speaking, under ideal conditions where precise timing analysis techniques were applied along sophisticated electronics capable of resolving extremely fine temporal variations corresponding uniquely mapped back onto distinct input frequencies - there might exist indirect methods leveraging quantum effects associated with different arrival timescales influenced subtly differently given varying interaction cross-sections over materials involved throughout pathlength traversed before detection conversion occurs fully.\n\nBut practically speaking using conventional setups designed merely detecting counts rates irrespective exact nature beyond simple existence criteria set forth initially via triggering mechanisms outlined earlier would fail distinguishing solely off basis specified percentage change stated here explicitly regarding intrinsic property values themselves absent further contextually relevant modifications enhancing discriminatory capabilities accordingly targeted specifically toward achieving desired outcome sought after indeed.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{No}}\n\\]"}

(You need not be quantitative, but your answer should make clear that you understand the basic physics involved.)\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "### Part (a)\n\n#### i) The Doppler Line Width:\nThe **Doppler line width** refers to the broadening effect observed in atomic or molecular emission spectra due to the thermal motion of atoms or molecules emitting light. As these particles move towards or away from an observer with varying velocities, their emitted radiation appears shifted in frequency according to the Doppler shift formula:\n\n\\[ f' = f_0 \\left(\\frac{c + v}{c}\\right), \\]\n\nwhere \\(f'\\) is the observed frequency, \\(f_0\\) is the rest-frame frequency, \\(v\\) is the velocity component along the direction of observation relative to the speed of light \\(c\\). This results in a distribution of frequencies around the central wavelength corresponding to different speeds.\n\nThus, even if all transitions were perfectly sharp without any intrinsic linewidths (\\(f_0\\)), the finite temperature would cause this spread out into what we call the *thermal* or *velocity-dependent* Doppler profile.\n\n#### ii) Natural Line Width:\nThe **natural line width**, also known as Lorentzian line width, arises because each atom emits photons spontaneously over time intervals governed by its excited state lifetime before transitioning back to ground states. Since there's no fixed moment when such emissions occur within large ensembles of identical systems, it leads naturally to a statistical spread centered on some mean transition energy/frequency.\n\nThis phenomenon can be described using Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle which relates uncertainties between position-momentum pairs and similarly applies here: \n\n\\[ \\Delta E \\cdot \\tau \\geq h/4\\pi,\\]\n \nWhere \\(\\Delta E\\) represents the range of energies across which spontaneous decay occurs, while \\(\\tau\\) denotes average life-time spent in the excited state; hence narrower peaks imply longer lifetimes and vice versa.\n\nIn summary,\n- **Doppler line width**: Broadening caused by random motions leading to variable phase shifts.\n- **Natural line width**: Intrinsic spreading due to quantum mechanical limitations on simultaneous knowledge about photon emission times & energies.\n\n---\n\n### Part (b)\nTo perform “Doppler-free” spectroscopy—measurements unaffected by Doppler effects—we typically use techniques like two-photon resonance methods where counterpropagating laser beams interact with moving atoms. Here’s how one might set up such an experimental arrangement conceptually:\n\n1. **Setup Two Counter-propagating Lasers:** Arrange lasers so they intersect perpendicularly inside a vacuum chamber containing gas sample under study. One beam travels left-to-right through the medium whereas another moves right-to-left symmetrically.\n\n2. **Resonant Conditions Across Velocities:** By carefully tuning both lasers close enough together yet still off-resonance individually against typical Doppler-shifted absorption profiles seen singly, ensure combined fields create effective resonances only near zero net momentum transfer conditions irrespective of particle movement directions.\n\n3. **Interference Effects Utilization:** When properly aligned, constructive interference happens precisely at points matching true stationary-state wavelengths rather than those distorted via individual Doppler redshift/blueshift contributions. Thus, detected signals reflect genuine internal electronic structure properties minus spurious kinematic distortions.\n\nBy employing sophisticated locking mechanisms ensuring precise control over multiple parameters including intensity ratios, polarization alignments etc., researchers achieve highly accurate determinations of fundamental constants associated directly with underlying physical processes sans complicating extraneous factors introduced merely owing to ambient temperatures affecting bulk matter dynamics.\n\nTherefore,\n\n(a)(i): $\\textbf{\\emph{(i)}}$ - Thermal motion-induced variation causing apparent frequency changes based on emitter-detector relative velocity differences.\n(ii): $\\textbf{\\emph{(ii)}}$ - Quantum mechanically dictated limits constraining exact timing information regarding discrete event occurrences tied specifically to specific energy levels’ stability characteristics.\n\nFinal Answer Box Format:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n(i)\\;\\text{Thermal-motion induced variations resulting in perceived frequency shifts depending upon mutual velocities}, \\\\\n(ii)\\;\\text{Quantum-limited precision bounds restricting perfect synchronization details linked exclusively to particular excitation durations}.\n}\n\\]"}

We'll break down our approach into several steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Given Data:\n- Radius of the lens: \\( r \\)\n- Focal Length of the lens: \\( f \\)\n- Diameter of the Sun as seen from Earth: approximately \\( 0.01 \\) radians.\n\nFirstly, let’s consider the geometry involved when using a thin convex lens for imaging purposes. When focused correctly, all parallel rays entering the lens will converge onto one point or form a small spot if not perfectly collimated due to diffraction limits but primarily geometric considerations here.\n\nThe key concept involves understanding the relationship between the size of the source (the Sun), the aperture of the lens (\\(2r\\)), and where these factors influence the resulting illumination pattern after passing through the lens.\n\n##### Flux Concentration Factor Calculation:\nFor simplicity, assume ideal conditions without considering atmospheric effects or other losses except those inherent within geometrical optics principles.\n\nIf you have a circular lens of radius \\( r \\):\n\\[ \nA_{\\text{lens}} = \\pi r^2 \n\\]\n\nSince the angle subtended by the Sun is very small (~\\(0.01\\) radian), it can be approximated that the effective illuminated portion of the lens acts like collecting solar radiation over an angular extent equivalent to the full disk of the Sun projected across the lens face.\n\nGiven the solid angle subtended by the Sun,\n\\[ \ndiameter(\\theta)= 0.01 \\implies Area(Sun)\\approx d^2/4=\\left(r\\times0.01\\right)^2/\\sin(0.5*0.01) \\sim \\frac{\\pi}{36} * (0.01*r)^2  \n\\]\nBut simplifying directly based on proportionality since angles are small,\n\nThus effectively, the fraction of total incident energy collected by the lens relative to the whole sky would scale linearly with the ratio of areas covered under similar projection assumptions:\n\\[ \nFractional\\_Collection= \\left(\\frac{DiamSunProjectedOnLens}{TotalLensedArea}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{0.01r}{2r}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{0.01}{2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{200}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{40000}\n\\]\n\nHowever, because the entire lens collects uniformly distributed incoming radiance and focuses it ideally into a smaller region defined by the focal properties, the actual concentration factor becomes inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area reduction achieved via proper alignment and focusing mechanism provided by the lens setup.\n\nSo essentially, the concentrated flux density increases by the inverse square law effect related to the magnification squared which aligns closely with the collection efficiency derived above.\n\nTherefore, the overall enhancement factor in terms of flux density upon correct focusing should then reflect:\n\\[ EnhancementFactor = \\frac{FluxDensityAfterFocusing}{InitialSkyBackgroundRadiationPerUnitArea}= \\frac{(CollectedEnergy/AreaOfFocusSpot)}{(CollectedEnergy/AreacollectedbyLens)}\n\\] \n\nConsidering perfect focusing scenario ignoring any loss mechanisms beyond basic optical laws:\n\\[EnhancementFactor = \\frac{Lens_Area}{Effective_Spot_Size} = \\frac{\\pi r^2 }{{\\pi(f/r)^2 }} = {r/f} ^2 \\]\n\nHence, the increased flux density compared to initial background uniform irradiance is thus determined solely by the ratio of lens dimensions vs. resultant spot formation dictated by chosen focal distance.\n\nNow addressing part two regarding condition for zero net gain despite concentrating action:\nSetting up equation such that there isn't additional benefit implies equal distribution post-focusing i.e., same average value maintained before & after process meaning:\n\\[ r=f \\Rightarrow NoIncreaseInIntensity \\]\n\nFinally summarizing results mathematically encapsulated below:\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left(\\frac{r}{f}\\right)^2} \\]\n\nAnd specific requirement for nullified enhancement yields:\n\\[ \\boxed{f=r} \\]"}

{"id": "optics/2-19", "questions": "﻿A 5 mm thick glass window 2 cm in diameter is claimed to have each  surface flat to within 1/4 wave of mercury green light $(\\lambda = 546 \\text{ nm})$, and the  pair of surfaces parallel to within 5 seconds of arc (1 arc sec $= 4.85 \\times 10^{-6}$  radians). How would you measure these properties to verify the manufacturer’s specifications? Your may assume the refractive index of the glass is  \n$n = 1.500$.\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "To verify the manufacturer's claims about a 5 mm thick, 2 cm diameter glass window being \"flat\" to within \\( \\frac{\\lambda}{4} \\) for mercury green light (\\( \\lambda = 546 \\text{ nm} \\)) and having its two surfaces parallel to within 5 seconds of arc:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Part A: Measuring Flatness Within \\( \\frac{\\lambda}{4} \\)\n\n**Concept:** The interference pattern from thin films can be used to determine if one or both sides of the glass plate are sufficiently smooth.\n\n1. **Setup Interference Experiment**: Place the glass between two optical flats with known precision. Use monochromatic light (mercury green line).\n\n2. **Interferometric Method**: Observe Newton rings formed due to constructive/destructive interferences when white light passes through the air gap created by non-flat surfaces. For precise measurements:\n   - Illuminate the setup using coherent laser light centered around \\( \\lambda_{green} = 546 \\text{ nm}\\).\n   \n3. **Calculation of Tolerance**: \n    - Given tolerance is \\( \\Delta z < \\frac{\\lambda}{4n_g} \\), where \\( n_g \\approx 1.500 \\):\n      \\[\n      \\Delta z < \\frac{546 \\text{ nm}}{4 \\cdot 1.500}\n      \\]\n     Simplifying,\n     \\[\n     \\Delta z < \\frac{546 \\text{ nm}}{6} = 91 \\text{ nm}.\n     \\]\n\nThus, any deviation greater than this value indicates that the surface does not meet the specification.\n\n---\n\n#### Part B: Verifying Parallelism To Within 5 Seconds Of Arc \n\n**Concept:** Measure angular deviations directly via interferometry or indirectly using autocollimators.\n\n1. **Autocollimator Setup**: An autocollimator measures small angles accurately.

Explain qualitatively.\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "To solve these problems related to the emission of electromagnetic radiation due to relativistic motion of charges past a periodic structure like a diffraction grating, we need to delve into some fundamental principles involving special relativity and wave interference effects.\n\n### Part (a): Frequency Dependence\n\nWhen considering how the frequency $\\nu(\\theta)$ depends on angle for the emitted radiation:\n\n- The key concept here involves understanding synchrotron or Cherenkov-like emissions where moving charge distributions can emit coherent waves depending on their relative velocities and spatial arrangement.\n  \nFor simplicity, let's consider the scenario as described: A stream of charged particles moves along the axis of symmetry of a periodically structured metal surface (grating). When such a system emits radiation perpendicularly to its path but within the same plane defined by both the movement vector and the normal to the grating lines, one must account for Doppler shifts induced by the relative speed between emitting sources and observation points.\n\nIn general terms:\n\\[ k = n\\frac{m}{vd} + qk_0 \\]\nwhere \\(n\\) represents integer multiples corresponding to different orders of constructive interference,\n\\(q\\) accounts for additional phase contributions possibly arising from material properties or other factors not specified directly herein (\\(k_0\\) being wavenumber associated purely with free-space propagation).\n\nGiven the relationship between angular frequency ($\\omega=ck$, c being speed of light), we have:\n\\[ \\omega(n,\\theta)=c(k_n)\\]\n\nHowever, since our primary interest lies specifically about directional dependence under given conditions, focusing more closely on classical treatment using Fourier analysis might simplify matters further without loss of essential physical insight.\n\nFrom Purcell’s work referenced, the observed frequencies would be modulated according to Bragg scattering rules adapted for dynamic scenarios:\n\\[ d|\\sin{\\phi}|=\\lambda_{emitted}\\left(m+\\delta_m\\right); m=0,±1,...; -1/2<δ_m≤+1/2.\\]\n\nHere, $\\phi$ denotes the angle measured off-axis compared to initial incident orientation, while $\\lambda_{emitted}$ corresponds effectively to wavelength seen after accounting for all relevant dopplers etc.\n\nThus, solving explicitly yields:\n\\[ f(\\theta) = \\gamma v / d |\\cos{(θ)}| ; θ ≠ π/2 ,\\] \nwith γ denoting Lorentz factor relating rest frame vs lab-frame speeds.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\\[f(\\theta) ∝ | \\cot {(\\theta)} |^{-1},\\text{for } \\theta≠π/2 .\\]\n\nThis indicates higher frequencies towards edges away from direct forward/backward directions.\n\n### Final Answer for part (a):\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(\\theta) \\propto \\left| \\cot {\\theta} \\right|}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Part (b): Transmission Gratings Impact\n\nConsidering replacing the metallic grating with another type—such as transparent media having similar groove structures—the qualitative behavior remains largely unchanged regarding basic mechanisms involved. However, there could be subtle differences attributed mainly to refractive index variations affecting effective wavelengths inside materials versus vacuum cases.\n\nKey Points:\n- Refracted paths may alter slightly based on medium-dependent dispersion relations.\n- Phase changes across interfaces introduce minor modifications potentially altering exact spectral intensities/localizations somewhat differently than pure metals which often exhibit plasmonic resonances enhancing certain modes distinctly over others.\n\nOverall though, core principle retains validity suggesting no drastic deviation expected unless specific optical characteristics significantly modify underlying assumptions made earlier concerning uniformity/symmetry aspects critical during derivation steps above.\n\nTherefore, primarily expect consistent patterns albeit nuanced adjustments possible contingent upon detailed microscopic interactions unique to each setup considered beyond generic framework outlined initially. \n\n---\nNo major quantitative shift noted thus far justifying broad applicability despite substrate variation mentioned."}

When it passes through the first polarizer (let's call it P1), only half of the original intensity gets through because the average effect on random orientations reduces the intensity by half:\n     \\[\n     I_{\\text{after }P1} = \\frac{I_0}{2}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Effect of Subsequent Polarizers:**\n   - Each subsequent polarizer will further reduce the intensity based on Malus' law which states that when linearly polarized light encounters another polarizer whose orientation makes an angle θ from the direction of polarization of the incoming wavefronts,\n     \\[\n     I_{\\text{transmitted}} = I_{\\text{incident}} \\cos^2(\\theta)\n     \\]\n     \n4. **Angles Between Successive Plates:**\n   - The second polarizer (P2) is rotated 30 degrees relative to P1; thus, for any ray passing through P1, the next filter (P2) will have an effective angle difference of 30 degrees between their axes.\n     \\[\n     I_{\\text{after }P2} = I_{\\text{after }P1} \\cdot \\cos(30^\\circ)^2 \n                         = \\left(\\frac{I_0}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2  \n                         = \\left(\\frac{I_0}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) \n                         = \\frac{3I_0}{8}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Third Plate Calculation:**\n   - Similarly, the third polarizer (P3) is also tilted 30 degrees more than P2 making the total tilt from P1 as 60 degrees.\n     \\[\n     I_{\\text{after }P3} = I_{\\text{after }P2} \\cdot \\cos(30^\\circ)^2 \n                          = \\left(\\frac{3I_0}{8}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 \n                          = \\left(\\frac{3I_0}{8}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) \n                          = \\frac{9I_0}{32}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Fourth Plate Calculation:**\n   - Finally, the fourth polarizer (P4) tilts 30 degrees more compared to P3 resulting in a cumulative rotation of 90 degrees from P1.\n     \\[\n     I_{\\text{final}} = I_{\\text{after }P3} \\cdot \\cos(30^\\circ)^2 \n                      = \\left(\\frac{9I_0}{32}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 \n                      = \\left(\\frac{9I_0}{32}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) \n                      = \\frac{27I_0}{128}\n     \\]\n\nThus, after all four polarizers, the fraction of the initial intensity remaining is given by\n\n\\[ \\frac{27}{128}. \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe amount of the intensity of the incident unpolarized beam of light that is transmitted by the stack is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{27}{128}}\n\\]"}

The key concepts involve wave optics principles such as constructive and destructive interferences due to path differences between waves coming from different slits.\n\n### Part (a): Interference Pattern\n\nWhen monochromatic coherent light passes through two closely spaced parallel slits, it creates an interference pattern on a detection surface like a photographic plate or a CCD sensor after passing through a converging lens. This setup transforms the linear spatial frequency into angular frequencies which can be visualized directly using the lens's focus properties.\n\nThe central maximum will have the highest brightness because there’s no phase difference for paths originating from both slits reaching here; hence they constructively interfere maximally. On either side of the center, secondary maxima appear where smaller but still significant bright spots occur due to partial alignment of phases leading to lesser yet noticeable constructive interference. Between these brighter regions lie dark fringes caused by complete cancellation out of interfering beams arriving 180 degrees out-of-phase.\n\nA sketch would show:\n- A strong peak centered around zero displacement,\n- Dimmer peaks symmetrically distributed away from the center along positive/negative x-axis directions representing positions corresponding to higher order minima/maxima respectively,\n- Dark bands separating each pair of adjacent bright ones indicating points of total destructive interference.\n\nMathematically speaking, if \\(I_0\\) represents the intensity at any given position within one fringe width (\\(\\Delta y\\)), then:\n\n\\[ I(y)=4I_{max}\\cos^2(kd\\sin{\\theta}/2)\\left( \\frac{J_1(B)}{(B/2)^2} \\right)^2,\\]\n\nwhere \n\\(k=2π/\\lambda\\) is wavenumber,\n\\(d=\\text{slit separation distance},\\)\n\\(\\theta = \\arctan(y/f), f=\\text{lens' focal length}, B=(kaD)/f.\\)\n\nHere, \\(y\\) denotes transverse coordinate measured relative to optical axis perpendicular to slit array direction, while \\(x\\) measures longitudinal extent across detector plane aligned perpendicularly thereto.\n\nFor simplicity though, let us just describe qualitatively: \n\n**Graph Description**: Intensity vs Position plot showing sharp spikes near origin tapering off gradually towards edges forming periodic undulations indicative of alternating high-low contrast zones characteristic of typical Young's Double Slit Experiment results under ideal conditions assuming single wavelength illumination & infinitesimal aperture sizes compared against wavelengths involved.\n\n---\n\n### Part (b): Effect of Moving Slits Further Apart\n\nIf you increase the spacing 'd', several changes happen geometrically affecting resultant patterns seen post-interaction with lenses:\n\n- **Angular Separation Increases:** As d grows larger, successive principal maxima get pushed farther apart since their locations depend inversely upon slit gap dimensions i.e., \\((m+½)d\\approx mλ\\) dictates new spacings based solely now on modified parameters without altering fundamental physical constants governing behavior elsewhere unchanged thus far.\n  \nThis means more space exists between prominent features making overall structure less dense visually despite retaining same qualitative form otherwise unaltered fundamentally save quantitative shifts alone impacting exact placement coordinates only rather than intrinsic nature itself.\n\n**Second Graph Description**: Similar curve shape retained albeit stretched horizontally implying wider gaps exist amongst individual components comprising entire assembly viewed collectively together simultaneously.\n\n---\n\n### Part (c): Increasing Source Size Subtending Finite Angle
