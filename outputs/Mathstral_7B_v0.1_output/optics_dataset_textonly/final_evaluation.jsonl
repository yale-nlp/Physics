The DOF is essentially the range of distances over which objects appear acceptably sharp when viewed through a lens or optical system. It depends on several parameters including the object distance ($q$), the focal length of the lens ($f$), the $f$-stop number (which determines the aperture size), and the acceptable circle of confusion ($c$).\n\nThe formula for calculating the depth of field is derived using the concept of hyperbolas. Here's a simplified version of the derivation:\n\n1. **Object Distance**: Let's denote the object distance as $q$. This is the distance between the object and the lens.\n\n2. **Image Plane**: The image plane is located at a distance $p = f(1 + m)$ from the lens, where $m$ is the magnification factor. Since we're considering the object distance to be much larger than the focal length, we can approximate this as $p \\approx f$.\n\n3. **Circle of Confusion**: The circle of confusion ($c$) is the maximum allowable blur spot size on the sensor. If the actual image spot size exceeds this value, the object will appear out of focus.\n\n4. **Aperture Size**: The aperture size is determined by the $f$-stop number. A lower $f$-stop means a larger aperture, allowing more light into the camera but reducing the depth of field. Conversely, a higher $f$-stop means a smaller aperture, letting less light in but increasing the depth of field.\n\n5. **Depth of Field Calculation**: Using these concepts, the depth of field ($\\Delta q$) can be calculated as follows:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta q = 2Nc\\left(\\frac{q^2}{q - f}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n   Where:\n   - $N$ is the $f$-stop number, related to the aperture size.\n   - $c$ is the circle of confusion.\n   - $q$ is the object distance.\n   - $f$ is the focal length of the lens.", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "optics/2-61", "solution": " The Fabry-Perot interferometer is a device used to measure the wavelength or frequency of light waves. It consists of two parallel mirrors that reflect light back and forth between them, creating interference patterns. When light enters the interferometer through one mirror, it reflects off the second mirror and then back onto itself, causing constructive and destructive interference depending on its phase difference. This results in bright spots (maxima) where the light waves add up constructively and dark spots (minima) where they cancel out destructively.\n\nTo derive an equation for the positions of the maxima, we need to consider the path length traveled by each wave as it bounces back and forth between the mirrors. Let d be the distance between the mirrors, λ be the wavelength of the incident light, and m be an integer representing the number of reflections. Then, the total path length L can be expressed as:\n\nL = 2md + λ/2\n\nFor constructive interference to occur, this path length must be equal to an integral multiple of the wavelength:\n\nL = nλ\n\nwhere n is another integer. Combining these equations gives us:\n\nnλ = 2md + λ/2\n\nSolving for m yields:\n\nm = (n - 1/2)(λ / 2d)\n\nThis shows that the position of the maxima depends on both the wavelength of the incident light and the spacing between the mirrors. As you increase either parameter while keeping the other constant, the maxima will shift accordingly.\n\nThe shape of the maxima in a Fabry-Perot interferometer is typically Gaussian due to diffraction effects caused by the finite size of the mirrors. However, if the mirrors have perfect flatness and infinite extent, the maxima would take the form of sharp lines with no width.\n\nFinally, let's discuss the resolving power of the instrument. Resolving power refers to the ability of an optical system to distinguish between closely spaced spectral features such as emission lines from different elements. In the case of the Fabry-Perot interferometer, the resolving power R is given by:\n\nR = λ / Δλ\n\nwhere Δλ represents the minimum separation between two adjacent maxima that can still be resolved.

The intensity distribution of the diffracted light can be described using Fraunhofer diffraction theory if the distance between the aperture and the observation point (in this case, the detector) is much larger than the wavelength of the light.\n\nThe intensity I(r) as a function of radial position r for a circular aperture of radius a is given by:\n\nI(r) = I0 * [J1(2πar/λ)/(2πar/λ)]^2\n\nwhere J1 is the Bessel function of the first kind, order one, I0 is the initial intensity, and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nTo find the values of the radius where the detector response reaches its first maximum and second minimum, we need to find the zeros of the derivative of I(r). However, since the exact form of the derivative is complex and involves Bessel functions, it's easier to plot the function and observe these points directly.\n\nUsing a computer program or graphing calculator, we can plot the normalized intensity I(r)/I0 against r/a for different values of r/a. We start with r/a = 0 (which corresponds to no aperture), and increase r/a until we see the first maximum and second minimum.\n\nFrom such a graph, we would typically find that the first maximum occurs around r/a ≈ 3.83, which corresponds to approximately 3.83 times the radius of the aperture. This means that the radius of the aperture should be adjusted so that the product of the radius and 3.83 equals the desired distance from the aperture to the detector.\n\nFor the second minimum, we continue increasing r/a until we see the next minimum. Typically, this occurs around r/a ≈ 7.02.\n\nOnce we have found these radii, we can then use them to find the positions of the maxima and minima along the axis.

Then, these light rays diverge and enter the eyepiece lens. Since the eyepiece lens is positioned so that its focal point coincides with the intermediate image, the light rays converge again after passing through the eyepiece lens.

In a lens of constant thickness but varying index of refraction, the curvature of the wavefront is determined by the gradient of the index of refraction.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have a disk of radius $a$ and thickness $d$, where the index of refraction varies radially from the center. This means that the index of refraction $n(r)$ depends on the distance $r$ from the center of the disk. Our goal is to find this function $n(r)$.\n\n2. **Snell's Law**: When light travels from one medium to another, it changes direction according to Snell's law: $\\frac{\\sin(\\theta_1)}{\\sin(\\theta_2)} = \\frac{n_2}{n_1}$, where $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction respectively, and $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the indices of refraction of the two media.\n\n3. **Thin Lens Approximation**: Since the lens is thin compared to its radius ($d \\ll a$), we can approximate that the change in angle occurs over a very small distance.

{"id": "optics/1-31", "solution": " To solve this problem, we will use the lens equation and some basic optics principles. The lens equation states that:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = \\frac{1}{f}\\]\n\nwhere \\( p \\) is the distance from the object to the lens, \\( q \\) is the distance from the lens to the image, and \\( f \\) is the focal length of the lens.\n\nFirst, let's find the distance from the object to the objective (let's call it \\( d_o \\)). Since the observer focuses for the image at infinity, the image formed by the objective is also at infinity. This means that the distance from the lens to the image (\\( q \\)) is equal to the focal length of the lens plus the distance from the lens to the focus (\\( F \\)), which can be calculated using the thin lens approximation as follows:\n\n\\[F = \\frac{d_l^2 - d_o^2}{4d_o}\\]\n\nwhere \\( d_l \\) is the distance between the two lenses.

For a ray of light to be reflected back exactly along its original path upon entering a medium with a higher index of refraction, the angle of incidence must be greater than or equal to the critical angle $\\theta_c$. This condition ensures that the light does not escape through the surface of the medium but instead gets totally internally reflected.\n\nThe critical angle $\\theta_c$ can be found using Snell's law:\n\\[ n_1\\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2\\sin(\\theta_2) \\]\nwhere $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the indices of refraction of two media, and $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and transmission, respectively. In this case, since the light should return along its original path, $\\theta_2 = \\pi - \\theta_1$, where $\\pi$ represents the straight line path.

Therefore, the sphere must have a higher index of refraction compared to the surrounding medium. Additionally, the radius of curvature of the sphere plays a crucial role in determining the range over which the retro-reflection occurs. A smaller radius would result in a narrower angular range for retro-reflection.\n\nIn summary, the key parameter enabling a sphere to retro-reflect light is having a higher index of refraction compared to the surrounding medium, and the appropriate radius of curvature to ensure total internal reflection within the desired angular range.\n\nFinal answer for part (a): \\[\\boxed{\\text{Higher index of refraction compared to the surrounding medium}}\\]\n\n(b) Scotchlite spheres work based on the principles discussed in part (a). They consist of tiny glass microspheres embedded in a plastic matrix. These microspheres have a high index of refraction compared to the surrounding plastic material. When light enters one of these microspheres, it undergoes multiple internal reflections due to the curved surfaces of the microsphere. As long as the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle, the light will continue to bounce off the inner walls until it exits the microsphere along the same path from which it entered.\n\nThe reflective efficiency of Scotchlite depends on several factors. Firstly, the size distribution of the microspheres affects their ability to capture incoming light rays. Larger microspheres may be more efficient at capturing light, while smaller ones could lead to less effective retro-reflection. Secondly, the concentration of microspheres within the plastic matrix influences the overall scattering and absorption properties of the composite material. Higher concentrations of microspheres generally improve the reflectivity, but excessive amounts could cause unwanted diffuse scattering. Lastly, the quality of the interface between the microspheres and the plastic matrix also impacts the reflective efficiency.

The principle here is based on the laws of reflection and refraction.\n\nFirst, we would use a parabolic mirror to collect the light from the source and focus it onto a smaller area. This increases the intensity of the light. Then, we could use a convex lens to further concentrate this light into a narrower beam.

Conversely, if you have circularly polarized light incident upon a quarter wave plate with its fast axis aligned along the direction of propagation, the emerging light will be linearly polarized.\n\nTo analyze the light into its circularly-polarized components, we can use another quarter wave plate followed by a linear polarizer. If the second quarter wave plate has its slow axis perpendicular to the first, then the two together act like a half wave plate, rotating the plane of polarization by 90 degrees.

In this case, we have a circularly polarized beam of light with an intensity of 1 W/m² (since power per unit area gives us intensity), and it's being absorbed by the slab. However, there seems to be a mistake in the reference solution provided. The correct formula should involve the intensity of the light rather than the energy density. Since we don't have enough information about the dimensions of the slab or the exact nature of the absorption process, we cannot calculate the torque accurately.

Then, the torque would depend on the radius of the slab and the distance from the center of mass to the point of application of the force. Without these values, we cannot proceed further.\n\n**Part (b)**\nFor a reflecting slab, the situation changes because the light is reflected back at 180° to its original direction.

{"id": "optics/1-39", "solution": " To solve this problem, we need to understand how the lens affects the luminous flux from the sun when it is focused onto a flat white surface. We will break down the solution into several steps:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the initial luminous flux (without the lens)\nThe initial luminous flux can be calculated using the formula for the intensity of sunlight, which is approximately 1367 W/m². Since the sun's diameter subtends about 0.01 radians from Earth, we can calculate the area illuminated by the sun as follows:\nArea = π * r² / sin(θ), where r is the distance between the observer and the sun, and θ is the angle subtended by the sun's diameter. However, since we don't have the value of r or θ, we cannot proceed with calculating the exact initial luminous flux without additional information.\n\nStep 2: Understand the effect of the lens on luminous flux\nA lens focuses light by bending its path, causing parallel rays to converge at a single point called the focal point. When the sun's image is focused on the flat white surface, the total energy remains constant; however, the concentration of energy per unit area increases due to the smaller area covered by the focused beam. This results in a higher luminous flux density in the image area compared to the initial luminous flux.\n\nStep 3: Determine the relationship between the lens parameters and the increased flux\nTo determine how much greater the flux in the image area is, we need to consider the properties of the lens. Specifically, we should look at the ratio of the areas illuminated before and after focusing. Let A₁ represent the initial area illuminated by the sun, and A₂ represent the area of the focused image. Then, the ratio of the areas is equal to the square of the magnification factor M:\nM = A₂ / A₁\nSince the total energy remains constant, the ratio of the fluxes F₁ and F₂ is also equal to the inverse of the magnification factor:\nF₂ / F₁ = 1 / M\nNow, let's find the magnification factor in terms of the lens parameters. Using similar triangles formed by the object (sun), the lens, and the image, we get:\ntan(θ₁) / tan(θ₂) = -dₒ / dᵢ\nwhere θ₁ represents half of the angular size of the sun, θ₂ represents half of the angular size of the image, dₒ is the object distance (distance between the sun and the lens), and dᵢ is the image distance (distance between the lens and the focused image). Rearranging the equation above, we obtain:\nM = dₒ / |dᵢ|\nUsing the thin-lens approximation, we know that the sum of the reciprocals of the distances equals the reciprocal of the focal length:\n1/dₒ + 1/dᵢ = 1/f\nSubstituting the expression for M back into the equation, we get:\nM = dₒ / |dᵢ| = dₒ / |f - dₒ|\n\nStep 4: Find the condition for no increase in flux\nFor the lens to give no increase in flux in the image, the magnification factor M must be equal to 1. Setting M = 1 in the equation derived earlier, we get:\n1 = dₒ / |f - dₒ|\nSolving for f, we obtain two possible solutions:\nf = 2dₒ or f = 0\nHowever, f = 0 does not make sense physically because it would imply that the lens has zero thickness.

The corresponding distance on the image plane is then:\n\nΔr = r * tan(θ)\n\nwhere r is the radius of curvature of the lens (which is related to its focal length).\n\nThe defocus blur for a star at infinity is simply the difference between the actual position of the focus and where it should be for an object at infinity, which is the focal length of the lens. So, the defocus blur is:\n\nΔf = |f - r|\n\nWe want these two quantities to be equal, so we set them equal to each other and solve for the diameter of the aperture:\n\nr * tan(λ / d) = |f - r|\n\nThis equation cannot be solved analytically for d, but we can use numerical methods to find an approximate value.

{"id": "optics/1-37", "solution": " 1. First, we need to understand that the intensity of light from a source decreases as it travels away from the source. This decrease can be described using the inverse square law: I = Io / r^2, where I is the intensity at distance r, Io is the initial intensity, and r is the distance from the source.\n\n2. In this case, the source is the sun's surface, which has a certain intensity Io. The lens collects this light and focuses it onto its focal plane, creating an image of the sun.\n\n3. The distance between the sun's surface and the lens is much greater than the distance between the lens and its focal plane. Therefore, when calculating the intensity of the image on the focal plane, we can approximate that all the light collected by the lens comes from a point source located at the focus of the lens.\n\n4. Using the inverse square law, we can calculate the intensity of the image on the focal plane as follows: I_image = Io * (focus)^2 / (sun-lens distance)^2. Since the focus of the lens is equal to its focal length f, we have I_image = Io * f^2 / (sun-lens distance)^2.\n\n5. Now, let's consider the area over which this intensity is spread out. On the sun's surface, the light is spread out over an area A_sun. When the light reaches the lens, it is still spread out over approximately the same area because the angle subtended by the sun at the lens is small due to the large distance between them. However, once the light passes through the lens and forms an image on the focal plane, it is concentrated into a smaller area A_image.\n\n6. We know that the ratio of areas is proportional to the square of the corresponding linear dimensions. So, if the diameter of the sun is D_sun and the diameter of the image on the focal plane is D_image, then A_sun / A_image = (D_sun / D_image)^2. Rearranging for A_image, we get A_image = A_sun * (D_image / D_sun)^2.\n\n7. Finally, we want to find the brightness B_image of the image on the focal plane, which is defined as the power per unit area: B_image = P_image / A_image. Substituting our expressions for I_image and A_image, we get B_image = Io * f^2 / (sun-lens distance)^2 * A_sun * (D_sun / D_image)^2.\n\n8. Notice that many terms cancel out in this expression, leaving us with B_image = Io * (f / D_image)^2. Recall that the focal length f of a lens is related to its diameter d by the formula f = d / 2. Thus, we can rewrite B_image as B_image = Io * ((d / 2) / D_image)^2.\n\n9. At this point, we don't actually need to know the exact values of any variables; instead, we just need to compare the relative magnitudes of B_image and Io. From our equation, it's clear that B_image will always be less than or equal to Io since both factors in front of Io are squared and positive. Furthermore, as long as the diameter of the image D_image is not significantly larger than the diameter of the lens d, then B_image should be very close to Io.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{The brightness of the image is near that of the surface of the sun}}\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{The brightness of the image is near that of the surface of the sun}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{The brightness of the image is near that of the surface of the sun}", "expr2": "L \\approx L'"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Since the energy remains constant throughout the process, we can write:\n\n$$I_{initial} \\cdot A_b = I_{final} \\cdot A_a$$\n\nSolving for the ratio between the two intensities, we obtain:\n\n$$\\frac{I_{final}}{I_{initial}} = \\frac{A_b}{A_a} = \\frac{\\pi \\times 2.5 \\times 10^{-8}}{\\pi \\times 2.5 \\times 10^{-7}} = \\frac{1}{10}$$\n\nThus, the intensity of the bright spot relative to the intensity with the opaque sheet removed is 1/10th of the original intensity.\n\nFinal answers:\nMaximum distance from the sheet: $\\boxed{200 \\text{ meters}}$\nIntensity ratio: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$", "final_answers": ["200 \\text{ meters}", "\\frac{1}{10}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "200 \\text{ meters}", "expr2": "r = 500"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "200 \\text{ meters}", "expr2": "I' = I_1 / 4"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{1}{10}", "expr2": "r = 500"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "1/10", "expr2": "500"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{1}{10}", "expr2": "I' = I_1 / 4"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "1/10", "expr2": "I/4"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

This value corresponds to the diameter of the primary mirror of a large-aperture telescope like Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nHowever, since we cannot directly control the diameter of the telescope lens or mirror, we must instead adjust the focal length of the short-focus lens placed after the telescope lens/mirror. By doing so, we effectively change the magnification factor ($M$), which scales both the object distance and image distance according to the thin lens formula:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{o} + \\frac{1}{i} \\]\n\nHere, $f$ represents the focal length of the short-focus lens, while $o$ and $i$ represent the object distance and image distance respectively. Since we want to minimize the divergence of the beam, we aim to maximize the magnification factor $M$. A larger magnification factor implies a smaller output beam size, leading to a more collimated (less divergent) beam.\n\nTo calculate the required focal length of the short-focus lens, we can rearrange the thin lens formula to solve for $f$:\n\n\\[ f = \\left(\\frac{1}{o} - \\frac{1}{i}\\right)^{-1} \\]\n\nGiven that the desired angular width is $10^{-6}$ radians, we can estimate the object distance ($o$) using the relationship between the angular size and actual size of the object:\n\n\\[ o = \\frac{\\text{size of the object}}{\\tan(\\theta)} \\]\n\nAssuming the object is a point source located at the focus of the telescope lens/mirror, its size will be negligible compared to the distance involved.

{"id": "optics/3-19", "solution": " (a) The Blue Sky:\nThe blue color of the sky is due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which occurs when light passes through a medium such as air or water. When sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules that scatter some of its energy in all directions. Shorter wavelengths of light (such as violet and blue) are scattered more than longer ones (red, orange, yellow), causing them to be scattered away from our line of sight. This leaves us with mostly blue light reaching our eyes, giving the sky its characteristic hue.\n\nFinal Answer: \\[\\boxed{\\text{Rayleigh Scattering}}\\]\n\n(b) The Red Sun at Sunset:\nDuring sunrise and sunset, we see the sun appear red because of another atmospheric effect known as Mie scattering. As the sun rises or sets, its light has to pass through more of Earth's atmosphere before reaching our eyes. In this case, larger particles like dust and water droplets scatter shorter-wavelength light (blue and green) much more effectively than they do longer-wavelength light (orange, yellow, and especially red). So, most of the blue and green light gets scattered out of our view, leaving only the remaining colors - primarily red, orange, and yellow - to reach our eyes. That's why the sun appears red during these times.\n\nFinal Answer: \\[\\boxed{\\text{Mie Scattering}}\\]\n\n(c) The Rainbow:\nA rainbow is formed when sunlight interacts with raindrops in the atmosphere. Each drop acts like a small prism, refracting (bending) the incoming sunlight into different colors based on their respective wavelengths.

If you look closely, you can even see individual bands for each color within the main arc of the rainbow.\n\nFinal Answer: \\[\\boxed{\\text{Refraction and Reflection}}\\]\n\n(d) The Twinkling of Stars:\nStars seem to \"twinkle\" because of a combination of factors related to their distance and Earth's own motion. Firstly, stars are so far away that their light takes years to reach us; thus, any changes in their brightness occur over long periods of time. Secondly, Earth itself moves around the sun, constantly changing its position relative to other celestial bodies. These movements cause slight variations in the amount of starlight reaching our eyes, creating the illusion of twinkling.

The thickness of the TiO2 film can be calculated using the quarter-wave condition, which states that maximum constructive interference occurs when the optical path difference between the reflected waves from the top and bottom surfaces of the film is equal to half a wavelength (λ/2). This condition ensures that the light waves add up in phase after reflection, resulting in maximum reflection.\n\nThe formula for calculating the thickness (d) of the TiO2 film is:\n\nd = λ / [4 * |n1 - n2|]\n\nwhere:\nλ is the chosen wavelength,\nn1 is the refractive index of the TiO2 film (2.5),\nn2 is the refractive index of the glass substrate (1.5).\n\nLet's choose a wavelength within the visible range, such as 600 nm (red light).

{"id": "optics/2-50", "solution": " To solve this problem, we need to understand that when light passes through multiple slits, it creates an interference pattern due to constructive and destructive interference. The intensity of the peaks depends on the number of slits and their spacing. In this case, we have 5 equally spaced slits.\n\nStep 1: Understand the setup\nWe have an opaque screen with 5 equally spaced narrow slits. Monochromatic plane-wave light is incident normally onto these slits. We want to find the transmitted intensity versus angle to the normal for angles up to approximately θ = 1/5 radians. We also assume d/λ = 10, where d is the spacing between the slits and λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the positions of the maxima and minima\nThe position of the maxima and minima can be calculated using the formula mλ/d = sin(θ), where m is an integer representing the order of the maximum or minimum, λ is the wavelength of the light, d is the spacing between the slits, and θ is the angle to the normal. Since we're looking for the first few orders, we set m = 0, ±1, ±2, etc., and calculate the corresponding values of θ.\n\nFor our specific case, since d/λ = 10, we get θ = arcsin(m/10). For example, for m = 0, θ = 0; for m = 1, θ = arcsin(1/10) ≈ 0.1 radians; for m = -1, θ = -arcsin(1/10) ≈ -0.1 radians; and so on.\n\nStep 3: Sketch the intensity curve\nNow we can sketch the intensity curve based on the positions of the maxima and minima. The maxima will occur at the angles we just calculated, and the minima will occur halfway between them. The intensity of each peak decreases as the order increases because there are fewer slits contributing to the constructive interference.\n\nStep 4: Find the ratio of intensities\nTo find the ratio of intensities, we would ideally use diffraction theory to calculate the exact intensities of each peak. However, without doing that calculation here, we can make some qualitative observations. The zeroth-order maximum (at θ = 0) will be the most intense peak because all five slits contribute to its formation. The other maxima will be less intense because only a subset of the slits contributes to their formation. Therefore, the ratio of intensities of the least intense to the most intense peak will be less than 1 but greater than 0. Without performing the full calculation, I cannot give you an exact value for this ratio.\n\nStep 5: Find the angular distance of the first intense peak\nAs mentioned earlier, the first intense peak occurs at θ = arcsin(1/10) ≈ 0.1 radians.

{"id": "optics/2-86", "solution": " (a) This phenomenon is known as optical activity, specifically circular birefringence. Optical activity refers to the ability of some materials to rotate the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light that passes through them. In the case of circular birefringence, the difference in the indices of refraction ($n_R$ and $n_L$) for right- and left-circularly polarized light causes the rotation. When unpolarized light enters such a medium, it can be thought of as being composed of equal amounts of both right- and left-circularly polarized components. These two components travel at slightly different speeds due to their differing indices of refraction, causing one component to \"lead\" the other upon exiting the crystal. As a result, the emerging light has its plane of polarization rotated compared to the incident light.\n\n(b) To derive an expression for the angle $\\phi$, we start with the fact that the phase velocity of light in a medium is given by $v = c/n$. For right- and left-circularly polarized light, the velocities will be:\n\n$$v_{R} = \\frac{c}{n_R}$$\n$$v_{L} = \\frac{c}{n_L}$$\n\nSince the wavelengths ($\\lambda$) are related to the frequencies ($\\omega$) and velocities ($v$) by $\\lambda = v/\\omega$, we have:\n\n$$\\lambda_{R} = \\frac{v_{R}}{\\omega} = \\frac{c}{\\omega n_R}$$\n$$\\lambda_{L} = \\frac{v_{L}}{\\omega} = \\frac{c}{\\omega n_L}$$\n\nNow, let's consider the path length traveled by each component within the crystal of thickness $d$:\n\n$$l_{R} = d\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{\\lambda_{R}}\\right)$$\n$$l_{L} = d\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{\\lambda_{L}}\\right)$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda_{0}$ is the vacuum wavelength. Since the two components emerge from the crystal at the same time, the difference in their path lengths must correspond to half a period of oscillation (since they need to be out of phase by 180 degrees to cancel each other):\n\n$$|l_{R} - l_{L}| = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}$$\n\nSubstituting our expressions for $l_{R}$ and $l_{L}$, we get:\n\n$$d\\left|\\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{\\lambda_{R}} - \\frac{\\lambda_{0}}{\\lambda_{L}}\\right| = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}$$\n\nSolving for $\\phi$, we find:\n\n$$\\phi = \\frac{\\pi d (\\lambda_{0}/\\lambda_{R} - \\lambda_{0}/\\lambda_{L})}{\\lambda_{0}}$$\n\nSimplifying further using the relationships between $\\lambda_{R}$, $\\lambda_{L}$, and $n_R$, $n_L$, we obtain:\n\n$$\\phi = \\frac{\\pi d (n_L - n_R)}{\\lambda_{0}(n_L + n_R)}$$\n\nThus, the angle $\\phi$ by which the plane of polarization of light of frequency $\\omega$ is rotated in passing through a thickness $d$ of the material is given by:\n\n$$\\boxed{\\phi = \\frac{\\pi d (n_L - n_R)}{\\lambda_{0}(n_L + n_R)}}$$", "final_answers": ["\\phi = \\frac{\\pi d (n_L - n_R)}{\\lambda_{0}(n_L + n_R)}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\phi = \\frac{\\pi d (n_L - n_R)}{\\lambda_{0}(n_L + n_R)}", "expr2": "\\text{Optical activity}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\phi = \\frac{\\pi d (n_L - n_R)}{\\lambda_{0}(n_L + n_R)}", "expr2": "\\phi = \\frac{\\omega d}{2c} (n_R - n_L)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "pi*d(0)/lambda(2*n)", "expr2": "0"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "optics/1-26", "solution": " (a) To calculate the position of the final image, we need to consider the two lenses separately. The first lens has a focal length of 10 cm and the object is 40 cm away from it.

{"id": "optics/2-5", "solution": " (a) The interference pattern produced when light passes through two parallel slits can be sketched as follows:\n\n[Insert sketch here]\n\nThe pattern consists of alternating bright and dark bands, known as maxima and minima respectively. The distance between adjacent maxima or minima is called the period of the interference pattern. In the focal plane of the lens, this pattern appears as a series of equally spaced lines perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the incident light.\n\n(b) If we move the slits further apart while keeping their separation constant, the period of the interference pattern will increase. This means that the distance between adjacent maxima or minima will become larger. To see why this happens, consider that each slit acts like a secondary source of coherent light waves. When these waves interfere constructively or destructively, they create the observed pattern. As the slits get farther apart, the phase difference between the waves emanating from them increases, leading to a wider spacing between consecutive maxima/minima.\n\n(c) Increasing the size of the source so that it subtends a finite angle at the lens has several effects on the interference pattern. Firstly, if the source is extended but still small enough such that its angular extent is much less than the diffraction limit imposed by the slits, then the overall shape of the interference pattern remains unchanged. However, there may be some loss in contrast due to partial coherence among different parts of the source. Secondly, if the source becomes large enough to significantly exceed the diffraction limit, then the interference pattern will begin to wash out because the relative phases of the light waves arriving at the slits will vary across the source. In this case, the resulting image in the focal plane would resemble a blurred version of the original double-slit pattern.", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "optics/2-15", "solution": " To solve this problem, we need to understand that when visible light is incident on a material like glass, it gets partially transmitted through the material and partially reflected back into the air. The amount of reflection depends on the index of refraction (n) of the material and the angle of incidence. However, since the light is normally incident, the angle of incidence is zero degrees, which means there will be no transmission or absorption, only reflection.\n\nThe intensity of the reflected light also depends on the phase difference introduced by the path length difference due to the different indices of refraction. This phenomenon is known as interference. When two waves interfere constructively, they add up to give a wave with greater amplitude, resulting in more intense light. Conversely, if they interfere destructively, they cancel each other out, resulting in less intense light.\n\nIn our case, the light reflects off both surfaces of the glass sheet. If the path lengths of these two reflected waves differ by half a wavelength (or any integer multiple), then they will interfere constructively, making the reflected light more intense for those specific wavelengths.\n\nLet's denote the thickness of the glass sheet as d, its index of refraction as n, and the vacuum wavelength of the light as λ. According to Snell's law, the wavelength inside the glass is reduced by a factor of n:\n\nλ_glass = λ / n\n\nFor constructive interference, the path length difference should be equal to half a wavelength (or any integer multiple):\n\nd - (-d) = k * λ_glass/2, where k is an integer\n\nSubstituting λ_glass, we get:\n\n2d = k * λ / (2n)\n\nRearranging for λ, we find:\n\nλ = 4nd / k\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n\nd = 1.2 × 10^-6 m\nn = 1.50\nk can take integer values starting from 1\n\nWe want to find the wavelengths that satisfy this equation within the range of 400 nm to 700 nm.

{"id": "optics/2-78", "solution": " (a) Let's denote the intensity of the unpolarized part as $I_{un}$ and the intensity of the elliptically polarized part as $I_{ep}$. We know that the total intensity $I = I_{un} + I_{ep}$, where $I_{ep} = 1.5 I_0 - I_0 = 0.5 I_0$. Since the unpolarized component doesn't affect the result for any specific orientation of the analyzer, we can ignore it for our calculations.\n\nThe intensity of the light passing through the analyzer depends on the cosine squared of the angle between the transmission axis and the major axis of the ellipse formed by the elliptical polarization. If we assume that the major axis of the ellipse coincides with the x-axis, then the intensity will be given by:\n\n\\[I(\\theta) = I_{ep} \\cos^2\\theta\\]\n\nSo, the answer does not depend on the fraction of the light that is unpolarized because the unpolarized component contributes equally to all orientations of the analyzer.\n\n(b) After passing through the quarter-wave plate, the elliptically polarized light becomes circularly polarized. A quarter-wave plate changes the phase of one of the components by 90 degrees. So if the initial state was $(E_x, E_y)$, after passing through the quarter wave plate it becomes $(\\frac{E_x}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\frac{iE_y}{\\sqrt{2}})$. This means that the resulting electric field vector traces out a circle in the complex plane as time evolves.\n\nWhen this circularly polarized light passes through the linear polarizer, the maximum amount of light gets transmitted when the transmission axis of the polarizer aligns with either the real or imaginary parts of the electric field vector. In other words, the maximum occurs when the transmission axis forms a 45 degree angle with both the x and y directions. However, since the problem states that the maximum intensity is achieved when the analyzer transmission axis makes an angle of $30^\\circ$ with the $x$-axis, there must have been some error in the setup or interpretation of the question. Assuming no errors, the maximum intensity should occur at 45 degrees, not 30 degrees.\n\nHowever, let's proceed assuming the maximum intensity occurs at 30 degrees due to potential experimental error. At this angle, the intensity would be maximized but not necessarily equal to the full input intensity. To find the exact maximum intensity, you would need more information about the relative magnitudes of $E_x$ and $E_y$, which isn't provided in the question.\n\nAs for determining the fraction of the incident intensity which is unpolarized, without knowing the actual values of $I_{un}$ and $I_{ep}$, we cannot calculate this fraction directly from the given data.

We also know that the shift corresponds to the movement of the zero order fringe to the 4th order fringe, which means the total shift is equivalent to three times the spacing between the orders (\\(3\\frac{\\lambda}{d}\\)). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[3\\frac{\\lambda}{d} = (n-1)\\frac{\\lambda}{\\sin\\theta}\\]\n\nwhere \\((n-1)\\frac{\\lambda}{\\sin\\theta}\\) represents the additional path length introduced by the film. Since the angle \\(\\theta\\) is not provided, we assume it to be small enough such that \\(\\sin\\theta \\approx \\tan\\theta\\).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Understanding Polarization**: When unpolarized light passes through a polarizer, only the component of the electric field parallel to the polarizer's axis gets transmitted. The rest is absorbed or reflected. This means that if you have two polarizers with their axes aligned, all the light will be transmitted because every part of the wave can pass through both filters. However, if they are perpendicular, none of the light will get through because no part of the wave aligns with both filters.\n\n2. **Effect of Rotation on Transmission**: If one filter rotates relative to another, the amount of light transmitted decreases as the angle between them increases from 0 degrees (full transmission) to 90 degrees (no transmission). For angles between these extremes, the fraction of light transmitted is given by $\\cos^2(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the polarizers.\n\n3. **Applying this to Four Filters**: In our case, we have four filters, each rotated 30 degrees clockwise from the previous one. So, the first and fourth filters are not perfectly aligned but offset by 90 degrees. Therefore, any light that makes it past the first three filters must be blocked by the last one.\n\n4. **Calculating the Total Transmission**: We know that for each pair of consecutive filters, the transmission factor is $\\cos(30^\\circ)$.

Instead, they experience phase shifts depending upon their path length inside the groove compared to the flat region.

When it hits the first surface, it bends according to Snell's Law, which states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the reciprocal of the refractive indices of the two media.

Recall that a positive focal length corresponds to a converging lens, while a negative focal length corresponds to a diverging lens.\n\nGiven that $\\Delta_c > 0$ and $\\Delta_f < 0$, we know that the crown glass component will contribute positively to the overall focal length, while the flint glass component will contribute negatively. Since we want the resulting achromatic lens to be converging, we need to choose a configuration such that the absolute magnitude of the contribution from the crown glass is greater than that of the flint glass.\n\nIn other words, we require $|f_c| > |f_t|$. Since $f_c$ is positive and $f_t$ is negative, this implies that $f_c$ must be positive and $|f_c| > |-f_t|$. Thus, we conclude that one must use a converging crown glass lens cemented to a diverging flint glass lens to get a converging achromatic lens.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n(a) $$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \\left( \\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{R'} \\right)}$$\n\n(b) $$\\boxed{\\frac{\\Delta c}{f_c} + \\frac{\\Delta f}{f_t} = 0}$$\n\n(c) One must use a converging crown glass lens cemented to a diverging flint glass lens to get a converging achromatic lens.", "final_answers": ["\\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \\left( \\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{R'} \\right)", "\\frac{\\Delta c}{f_c} + \\frac{\\Delta f}{f_t} = 0"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \\left( \\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{R'} \\right)", "expr2": "\\frac{\\Delta_c}{f_c} + \\frac{\\Delta_f}{f_t} = 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "(R + R')*(n - 1)/(R*R')", "expr2": "0"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \\left( \\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{R'} \\right)", "expr2": "f_c > 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f_t < 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{\\Delta c}{f_c} + \\frac{\\Delta f}{f_t} = 0", "expr2": "\\frac{\\Delta_c}{f_c} + \\frac{\\Delta_f}{f_t} = 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "0", "expr2": "0"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.5}
{"id": "optics/3-23", "solution": " To calculate the ratio of the intensities of the reflected wave to the incident wave, we can use Fresnel's equations for reflection and transmission. In this case, since the light is incident normally on the surface of the water, we only need to consider one component of the electric field (the s-polarization). The reflectivity R is given by:\n\nR = |r|^2\n\nwhere r is the complex amplitude reflection coefficient, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\nr = (Z\\_water - Z\\_air) / (Z\\_water + Z\\_air)\n\nHere, Z\\_water and Z\\_air represent the impedances of water and air respectively. The impedance of a medium is defined as:\n\nZ = sqrt(mu/epsilon)\n\nFor nonmagnetic materials like water and air, mu is approximately equal to that of free space (4π x 10^-7 T m/A), so we can simplify the expression for impedance to:\n\nZ = c / n\n\nwhere c is the speed of light in vacuum (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s) and n is the refractive index of the material.\n\nFirst, let's find the impedances of water and air:\n\nZ\\_water = c / n\\_water = 3 x 10^8 m/s / 1.33 ≈ 2.26 x 10^8 Ohm/m\nZ\\_air = c / n\\_air = 3 x 10^8 m/s / 1 ≈ 3 x 10^8 Ohm/m\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation for r:\n\nr = (Z\\_water - Z\\_air) / (Z\\_water + Z\\_air) = (2.26 x 10^8 - 3 x 10^8) / (2.26 x 10^8 + 3 x 10^8) ≈ (-0.59) / (5.26) ≈ -0.112\n\nFinally, we can square the absolute value of r to get the reflectivity R:\n\nR = |r|^2 = |(-0.112)|^2 ≈ 0.0125 or 1.25%\n\nSo, the intensity of the reflected wave is about 1.25% of the intensity of the incident wave.

{"id": "optics/3-12", "solution": " (a) To derive an expression for the frequency distribution $f(\\nu)$ expected for a spectral line due to the Doppler broadening, we start with the fact that the velocity component along the direction of observation follows a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. For an ideal gas at temperature $T$ with molecular weight $M$, the root mean square speed $v_{rms}$ can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ v_{rms} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_BT}{m}} \\]\nwhere $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant and $m$ is the mass of one molecule.\n\nThe fractional change in wavelength due to the Doppler effect is proportional to the ratio of the velocity component parallel to the observer to the speed of light $c$:\n\\[ \\Delta\\lambda / \\lambda_0 = v/c \\]\nSince the velocities follow a Gaussian distribution, the resulting distribution of frequencies will also be Gaussian.
