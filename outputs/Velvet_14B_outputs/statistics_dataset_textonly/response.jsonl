The key point here would be understanding how dimensionality affects this quantum phenomenon which was first proposed based on Max Planck's work with black body radiation problem using statistical mechanics approach where he introduced what we now know today known \"Planck’s law\". In his derivation it involved introducing new concept called “quanta” i.e., discrete packets/packets energy levels within each mode frequency range leading us towards quantized nature light/matter behavior even though they were not yet named so back then! This idea later led Albert Eistein who further developed these ideas through wave-particle duality principle giving birth modern day Quantum Physics era including our current topic - BOSE –EINSTEIEN CONDENSATION EFFECT .\nNow coming onto question about its applicability across different dimensional systems like mentioned above :\nFor simplicity sake let consider ideal monoatomic particles(non interacting). For them all states available will have same amount total number density N/V = k_B*T /h^4/(m * v_squared),where m being mass particle ,v_Speed_of_sound,vacuum speed sound waves,h-Planks constant,k_b-Boltzmann contant T-Temperature . Now when temperature approaches absolute zero(T->O K);all those atoms get locked together forming single macroscopic state due their indistinguishability making entire system behave more classically than quantistically thus creating superfluidic phase transition(BEC)! But does similar thing happen down other spatial directions too ? Well no because unlike higher d-dimension space(lower ones do less volume hence lesser possible ways exist form condensate )and secondly since intermolecular forces play major role determining formation/shape condensates only high enough temperatures can break up formed structure again whereas low tempratures tend make things stable over longer period time scale allowing long lived coherent matterwave-like behaviour emerging out classical world view !

However considering ideal gases' behavior under these conditions would lead me towards using virial's relation like $$P= -\\left(\\sum_{i}\\langle x_i^{5}/R_0\\right)\\right)^{\\frac{-(N+7)}{8}} + P_{\\text{vac}}$$. This equation relates pressure (\\textit{P}) directly proportionality constant dependent upon number density ($\\rho$), radius($r$, assumed same across all dimensions), molar mass(mol/mL). The above mentioned relations should help you get started further into finding your desired answers based off what exactly do they want?"}
