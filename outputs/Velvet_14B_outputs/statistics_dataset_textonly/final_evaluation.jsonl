In his derivation it involved introducing new concept called “quanta” i.e., discrete packets/packets energy levels within each mode frequency range leading us towards quantized nature light/matter behavior even though they were not yet named so back then! This idea later led Albert Eistein who further developed these ideas through wave-particle duality principle giving birth modern day Quantum Physics era including our current topic - BOSE –EINSTEIEN CONDENSATION EFFECT .\nNow coming onto question about its applicability across different dimensional systems like mentioned above :\nFor simplicity sake let consider ideal monoatomic particles(non interacting). For them all states available will have same amount total number density N/V = k_B*T /h^4/(m * v_squared),where m being mass particle ,v_Speed_of_sound,vacuum speed sound waves,h-Planks constant,k_b-Boltzmann contant T-Temperature . Now when temperature approaches absolute zero(T->O K);all those atoms get locked together forming single macroscopic state due their indistinguishability making entire system behave more classically than quantistically thus creating superfluidic phase transition(BEC)! But does similar thing happen down other spatial directions too ? Well no because unlike higher d-dimension space(lower ones do less volume hence lesser possible ways exist form condensate )and secondly since intermolecular forces play major role determining formation/shape condensates only high enough temperatures can break up formed structure again whereas low tempratures tend make things stable over longer period time scale allowing long lived coherent matterwave-like behaviour emerging out classical world view ! So while theoretically speaking nothing stops possibility but practically observing phenomena becomes extremely challenging especially below certain critical length scales/local densities etc..", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

This means if you stretch something like elastic body then work done W will be stored elastical form but not converted into any other forms hence H remains constant because there's neither gain nor loss from external source during expansion/contraction under these conditions .\n2b-Stretching Adiabatic processes involves No Heat Exchange , only Work Done(W): When one stretches gas molecules they get more space between them thus increasing their kinetic energies without changing total amount due conservation law leading us here towards higher value than initial state since all those extra Kinetic Energy comes out being used up doing mechanical works against force applied when deforming material making sure Total Internal Thermal Potential doesn't grow even though Temperature may rise depending upon nature & type materials involved!", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

However when we consider systems that interact strongly enough to exchange heat or work between them then these equations become invalid as their energies will depend on what happens over all space around those objects i..e if you have A & B interacting so E_A + e_B depends upon T(A,B), pA,pB etc...and thus there would need more than just knowing state functions for each object alone but also about interactions! This leads us into our next question regarding entropy S where even though I don't know exact value yet ,I am able say something interesting : Entropy increases wrt some reference point . So far only positive temperatures were possible because increase was always associated via equation above .\nb(Negative Temperature ):\nThe concept arises due non-equilibrium nature wherein particles move faster below certain threshold limit called \"Negitve Absolute Temp\" ! It violates Third LaW since now instead increasing order/disorder occurs spontaneously leading towards lower disorder hence violating principle stating spontaneous processes go toward higher probability states -> here going against natural tendency causing violation !\nc(Suggested Example For Negative Temperatures )\nOne such case could involve superfluid Helium near zero Kelvin under high pressure conditions forming Bose-Einstein Condensate(BEC); Here quantum effects dominate making particle behave like single entity rather individual atoms creating coherent superposition allowing formation BEC exhibiting counterintuitive behavior including flowing without viscosity despite having mass density similar water ice/solids thereby behaving almost liquid-like however still maintaining coherence unlike normal liquids breaking down quickly losing phase information through interaction within themselves changing properties drastically once external field applied forcing
