Secondly its necessary enough amount electromagnetic radiation having sufficient frequency/wavelength matching right value needed based off Bohr’s model formula E=hf .

Indicate also the basis on which a value of $T$ is ascribed to such nuclear states. (Consider other members of the $T = 1$ triplets and explain their relationship in terms of systematic nuclear properties.)", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "The key point here lies with how we define \"isospins\" or, more specifically T-values within quantum mechanics's framework when it comes into play while dealing complex systems like atomic nucleus where protons & neutrons can be considered independent particles but not so much due inter-nuclear forces that bind them together forming what could look similar structure from outside - i.e., they behave almost identical way under certain conditions/forces acting upon these subatomic entities: \nIn this context 'Isos' means same; Isopsin refers towards total number(s) if any two different types(protons vs neutron). In our problem statement given above both N=Neutron Number(C=Atomic Mass Unit), C being lighter than Neucleon(Number Of Proton+NumberOf Neutrons)/ATOMIC MASS UNIT , hence its mass per nucleon less compared tN . This results higher binding energies leading lower excirations .\nNow coming back onto your question regarding why does one triplet set having very high excitations over another : It depends mainly based upn relative masses between nucleons constituting those neuclii! For example consider Helium atom He^I_He^+ion ;it’s just single proton +one electron making no sense even talking abt I-spin because electrons don’t carry charge nor do feel strong force unlike nuleus thus doesn't contribute anything significant wrt spin.. But once you add second Heliun ion then now each particle carries half integer spins contributing overall net Z-propulsion giving rise non-zero values along z-axis resulting increase excitational levels accordingly"}
