In our case since there isn't any current flow nor changes over space-time itself but only movement within some frame then just using classical electrodynamics should suffice without needing quantum mechanics concepts yet involved given enough distance away so far apart all else remains constant otherwise would need corrections accounting those too including energy levels etc..", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}
