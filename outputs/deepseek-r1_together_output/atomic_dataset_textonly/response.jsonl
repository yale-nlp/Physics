{"id": "atomic/1-41", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The question is about the hyperfine splitting of the hydrogen atom's ground state. I remember that hyperfine structure arises due to the interaction between the electron's magnetic moment and the proton's magnetic moment. The ground state of hydrogen is the 1s orbital, which has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l=0. Since l is zero, there's no orbital magnetic moment, right? So the main magnetic interaction here must be between the spin of the electron and the spin of the proton.\n\nThe electron has a spin of 1/2, and the proton also has a spin of 1/2. When you combine two spins, the total spin can be either S=1 (triplet state) or S=0 (singlet state). The hyperfine interaction energy depends on the relative orientation of these spins. The interaction energy should be lower when the spins are antiparallel (singlet) or higher when they are parallel (triplet)? Wait, no, wait. The magnetic dipole-dipole interaction energy is given by something like U = -μ₁·μ₂/(4πr³) + ... terms. But maybe it's easier to think in terms of the Hamiltonian. The hyperfine Hamiltonian is proportional to the dot product of the electron spin and the proton spin, S·I. \n\nThe energy levels then depend on the expectation value of S·I. For total spin states: when the total spin is S_total = S + I. For the triplet state (S_total = 1), the expectation value of S·I can be calculated using the formula S·I = [S_total² - S² - I²]/2. Since S and I are both 1/2, S² = I² = (1/2)(1/2 + 1)ħ² = 3/4 ħ². For the triplet state, S_total² = 1(1+1)ħ² = 2ħ². So S·I = (2ħ² - 3/4 ħ² - 3/4 ħ²)/2 = (2 - 1.5)ħ²/2 = 0.5ħ²/2 = 0.25ħ². For the singlet state, S_total = 0, so S_total² = 0. Then S·I = (0 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 * ħ² = (-1.5)/2 ħ² = -0.75ħ². \n\nWait, but the hyperfine interaction energy is proportional to S·I. So if the triplet state has a positive value of S·I and the singlet has a negative value, then the triplet state would have higher energy if the coefficient in front is positive. But what's the sign of the hyperfine interaction? The hyperfine interaction comes from the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction. The energy of two magnetic dipoles is U = (μ0/(4π)) * [ (μ1·μ2)/r³ - 3(μ1·r)(μ2·r)/r⁵ ]. But in the case of the hydrogen atom, the electron is in an s-orbital, so the expectation value of 1/r³ is actually divergent unless we consider the finite size of the nucleus. Wait, but maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, the hyperfine splitting is often treated using the Fermi contact interaction, which is a delta function term. The contact term is dominant for s-orbitals because the wavefunction is non-zero at the nucleus. The contact Hamiltonian is H_hf = A S·I, where A is a constant. The sign of A determines which state is higher. \n\nWhat's the sign of A? The magnetic moment of the electron is μ_e = -g_e μ_B S, and the proton's magnetic moment is μ_p = g_p μ_N I, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton and μ_N is the nuclear magneton. The interaction energy between two magnetic dipoles is U = -μ_e · μ_p. So substituting, U = g_e g_p μ_B μ_N S·I. Since g_e is positive (about 2) and g_p is positive for the proton (about 5.586 for the proton), the product g_e g_p is positive. μ_B and μ_N are positive constants. So U is proportional to S·I. Therefore, the triplet state (S·I positive) would have higher energy than the singlet state. Wait, but wait: the actual hyperfine splitting in hydrogen is such that the triplet state (total spin 1) is higher in energy than the singlet (total spin 0). The 21 cm line transition is between these two states, and the triplet is higher. So the answer is that the triplet state lies higher in energy. \n\nSo part (a) answer: the triplet state (total spin 1) is higher in energy than the singlet (total spin 0). \n\nNow part (b): the hydrogen molecule's ground state split into nuclear spin triplet and singlet. Which is higher? The hydrogen molecule has two protons (if we're considering H₂). The total nuclear spin can be triplet (I=1, symmetric) or singlet (I=0, antisymmetric). But the overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange of the two protons. The overall wavefunction is a product of spatial, electronic, and nuclear spin parts. \n\nIn the ground state of H₂, the electronic state is a singlet (since the bond is covalent and the electrons are paired with opposite spins). The spatial wavefunction for the ground state is symmetric under exchange of the two protons because it's the lowest energy state, which is symmetric (bonding orbital). So the electronic part is spin singlet (antisymmetric) and spatial symmetric. To make the total electronic wavefunction antisymmetric, since electrons are fermions, their overall wavefunction (spatial × spin) must be antisymmetric. Wait, but in H₂, the two electrons are in a singlet spin state (antisymmetric) and the spatial part is symmetric (bonding), so that's okay. \n\nBut the question is about the nuclear spin states. The nuclei are protons, which are fermions. So the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange of the two protons. The total wavefunction is the product of the electronic, spatial, and nuclear spin parts. The electronic part is already symmetric (since spatial is symmetric and spin is antisymmetric, their product is symmetric). Wait, no: the electronic spatial part is symmetric (bonding orbital) and the electronic spin is antisymmetric (singlet). So the electronic part (spatial × spin) is symmetric × antisymmetric = antisymmetric. Then the nuclear part must be antisymmetric × something to get the total wavefunction antisymmetric. Wait, the total wavefunction is the product of electronic, nuclear spin, and nuclear spatial parts. Wait, but the nuclei are also in some spatial state. However, in the ground state of the molecule, the nuclear spatial wavefunction is symmetric under exchange because the molecule is in the vibrational ground state, which is symmetric. So the nuclear spatial part is symmetric. The nuclear spin part can be triplet (symmetric) or singlet (antisymmetric). \n\nSo the total wavefunction is electronic (antisymmetric) × nuclear spatial (symmetric) × nuclear spin (symmetric or antisymmetric). To have the total wavefunction antisymmetric, we need:\n\nelectronic (antisymmetric) × nuclear_spatial (symmetric) × nuclear_spin (?) = antisymmetric.\n\nSo antisymmetric × symmetric × nuclear_spin = antisymmetric. Therefore, nuclear_spin must be symmetric (triplet) to make the product antisymmetric × symmetric × symmetric = antisymmetric. Wait, no: multiplying the three parts. Let me think again. The total wavefunction is the product of electronic, nuclear spatial, and nuclear spin. The exchange of the two protons swaps their positions, spins, etc. \n\nThe electronic part is antisymmetric under exchange (as we said: spatial symmetric × spin antisymmetric = antisymmetric). The nuclear spatial part is symmetric (since they're in the ground vibrational state, which is symmetric). The nuclear spin part is either symmetric (triplet) or antisymmetric (singlet). \n\nSo total wavefunction: antisymmetric (electronic) × symmetric (nuclear spatial) × nuclear_spin. For the total to be antisymmetric, we need antisymmetric × symmetric × nuclear_spin = antisymmetric. So antisymmetric × symmetric = antisymmetric. Then antisymmetric × nuclear_spin must be antisymmetric. Therefore, nuclear_spin must be symmetric. Wait, no. Let me do it step by step. Let’s denote exchange operator as P. \n\nP(total) = P(electronic) × P(nuclear spatial) × P(nuclear spin) \n\nWe need P(total) = -total (since fermions). \n\nGiven that P(electronic) = -electronic (because electronic is antisymmetric), P(nuclear spatial) = +nuclear spatial (symmetric), and P(nuclear spin) = + for triplet (symmetric) or - for singlet (antisymmetric). \n\nSo P(total) = (-1) × (+1) × (±1) = ∓1. \n\nWe need P(total) = -total, so:\n\nFor triplet (symmetric nuclear spin): P(total) = (-1)(+1)(+1) = -1. Which satisfies the antisymmetry requirement. \n\nFor singlet (antisymmetric nuclear spin): P(total) = (-1)(+1)(-1) = +1. Which does not satisfy the antisymmetry. \n\nWait, but that can't be. Wait, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. So if the nuclear spin is singlet (antisymmetric), then P(total) = (-1)(+1)(-1) = +1, which would mean the total wavefunction is symmetric, which is not allowed. Therefore, the nuclear spin must be triplet (symmetric) to make P(total) = -1. \n\nBut wait, that would imply that only the nuclear spin triplet is allowed. But the question states that the ground state is split into triplet and singlet. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the nuclear spin and rotational states are involved. Wait, another possibility: the rotational state of the molecule. For homonuclear diatomic molecules like H₂, the rotational wavefunction has symmetry depending on the angular momentum quantum number J. The rotational wavefunction for even J is symmetric under exchange, and for odd J is antisymmetric. \n\nIn the ground vibrational state, the rotational state can have J=0 (symmetric), J=1 (antisymmetric), etc. So the total wavefunction is electronic × nuclear_spin × rotational × vibrational. But vibrational is symmetric (ground state). So putting it all together: \n\nTotal wavefunction = electronic (antisymmetric) × vibrational (symmetric) × rotational (symmetric for even J, antisymmetric for odd J) × nuclear_spin (symmetric or antisymmetric). \n\nTo have the total wavefunction antisymmetric, the product of all these parts must be antisymmetric. \n\nSince electronic × vibrational is antisymmetric × symmetric = antisymmetric. Then rotational × nuclear_spin must be antisymmetric × something to get total antisymmetric. Wait, the product of rotational and nuclear_spin must be symmetric to combine with the antisymmetric part (electronic × vibrational) to give total antisymmetric. Because antisymmetric × symmetric = antisymmetric. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nTotal = (electronic × vibrational) × (rotational × nuclear_spin). \n\nWe have (electronic × vibrational) is antisymmetric. So (rotational × nuclear_spin) must be symmetric to make Total = antisymmetric × symmetric = antisymmetric. \n\nTherefore, rotational × nuclear_spin must be symmetric. \n\nSo rotational symmetry: even J (symmetric), odd J (antisymmetric). \n\nNuclear spin: triplet (symmetric), singlet (antisymmetric). \n\nSo for the product to be symmetric: \n\nEither rotational (symmetric, even J) × nuclear_spin (symmetric) → symmetric × symmetric = symmetric. \n\nOr rotational (antisymmetric, odd J) × nuclear_spin (antisymmetric) → antisymmetric × antisymmetric = symmetric. \n\nTherefore, for each rotational state (even or odd J), the nuclear spin must be symmetric or antisymmetric accordingly. \n\nIn the ground rotational state, J=0 (even), which is symmetric. Therefore, the nuclear spin must be symmetric (triplet) to satisfy the product being symmetric. For J=1 (odd, antisymmetric), the nuclear spin must be antisymmetric (singlet). \n\nBut the question is about the ground state, which is the lowest energy state. The lowest rotational state is J=0. So in the ground state, the rotational part is symmetric (J=0), hence the nuclear spin must be symmetric (triplet). However, the question says the ground state is split into nuclear spin triplet and singlet. Wait, maybe the splitting is due to the nuclear spin interaction, not the rotational state. But the energy difference between different nuclear spin states comes from the interaction between the nuclear spins. \n\nIn hydrogen molecule, the protons are fermions, so the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. The ground electronic state is singlet (antisymmetric electronic spin), symmetric spatial (bonding), so electronic part is antisymmetric. The vibrational is symmetric (ground state). Rotational state for J=0 is symmetric. Therefore, the nuclear spin must be symmetric (triplet) to make the total antisymmetric. But if the rotational state is J=1 (antisymmetric), then nuclear spin must be antisymmetric (singlet). \n\nBut the question is about the splitting of the ground state into nuclear spin triplet and singlet. However, in the actual molecule, even in the ground rotational state (J=0), there can be both nuclear spin states, but due to the Pauli exclusion principle, only certain combinations are allowed. Wait, no. For J=0 (symmetric rotational), the nuclear spin must be symmetric (triplet). For J=1 (antisymmetric rotational), nuclear spin must be antisymmetric (singlet). So the allowed states are combinations of rotational and nuclear spin states. \n\nBut the question is about the energy splitting between the nuclear spin triplet and singlet states. The hyperfine interaction in molecules is due to the nuclear spin-spin interaction. The interaction energy between the two nuclear spins would be similar to the atomic case: the energy depends on the orientation of the spins. If the nuclear spins are parallel (triplet), the energy is higher, or lower? \n\nThe nuclear spin-spin interaction energy is given by something like U = k * (I1·I2), similar to the hyperfine in atoms. The energy is proportional to I1·I2. For triplet state (I=1), I1·I2 = [I_total² - I1² - I2²]/2. I1 and I2 are both 1/2. So I_total² for triplet is 1(1+1)ħ² = 2ħ². Then I1·I2 = (2 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 ħ² = (2 - 1.5)/2 ħ² = 0.5/2 ħ² = 0.25 ħ². For singlet (I=0), I_total² = 0, so I1·I2 = (0 - 3/4 - 3/4)/2 ħ² = (-1.5)/2 ħ² = -0.75 ħ². \n\nIf the interaction energy is positive when spins are parallel (triplet), then the triplet state would have higher energy. But the actual interaction between two magnetic dipoles (nuclear spins) would depend on their relative positions. However, in the molecule, the nuclei are in a fixed separation (on average), so the interaction could be modeled as a contact interaction. The sign of the interaction constant determines which is higher. \n\nIn the case of like spins (protons), the magnetic dipole interaction would have a lower energy when the spins are antiparallel (singlet) because the magnetic moments are opposite, leading to a lower energy configuration. Wait, but the dipole-dipole interaction energy is U ∝ (μ1·μ2 - 3(μ1·r)(μ2·r)/r²). For two dipoles aligned along the axis connecting them (r direction), if they are parallel, the second term is -3μ²/r³, so total U is μ²/r³ (1 - 3) = -2μ²/r³. If they are antiparallel, μ1 = -μ2, so U would be -μ²/r³ (1 - 3) = +2μ²/r³. Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again. \n\nThe dipole-dipole interaction energy between two magnetic moments μ1 and μ2 separated by r is:\n\nU = (μ0 / 4π) * [ (μ1·μ2) / r³ - 3 (μ1·r)(μ2·r) / r⁵ ]\n\nIf the dipoles are aligned along the line connecting them (say, along the z-axis), then μ1 and μ2 are in the z-direction. Then μ1·μ2 = μ1 μ2, and (μ1·r)(μ2·r) = μ1 μ2 r². So substituting:\n\nU = (μ0 / 4π r³) [ μ1 μ2 - 3 μ1 μ2 ] = (μ0 μ1 μ2 / 4π r³) (1 - 3) = -2 (μ0 μ1 μ2 / 4π r³ )\n\nSo if the dipoles are parallel (both in the same direction along r), the energy is negative (lower energy). If they are antiparallel (μ1 = -μ2), then μ1·μ2 = -μ², and the term becomes:\n\nU = (μ0 / 4π r³) [ -μ² - 3 (-μ²) ] = (μ0 μ² / 4π r³) ( -1 + 3 ) = 2 (μ0 μ² / 4π r³ )\n\nSo antiparallel gives higher energy. Wait, but this is when they are aligned along the separation axis. In a molecule, the nuclei are at a fixed distance, but the dipoles can be oriented in any direction. However, in the ground state, the interaction would average over all orientations unless there's a preferred direction (like in a magnetic field). But in the absence of an external field, the spins are in random orientations, but the hyperfine splitting would depend on the expectation value of the interaction. \n\nAlternatively, if the nuclear spins are in a triplet state (parallel), the magnetic interaction would be lower in energy if parallel dipoles have lower energy. But according to the calculation above, when aligned along r, parallel dipoles have lower energy (U negative). However, in three dimensions, the average over all angles might change this. The angle-averaged dipole-dipole interaction for random orientations is zero. Wait, but in the molecule, the nuclei are fixed in position, so the interaction isn't averaged out. However, the contact term might dominate. \n\nAlternatively, the nuclear spin-spin interaction in molecules can be modeled with a Hamiltonian similar to H = A I1·I2, where A is a constant. The energy would then be proportional to I1·I2. As before, for triplet (I=1), I1·I2 = 0.25 ħ², and for singlet (I=0), I1·I2 = -0.75 ħ². If A is positive, then the triplet state has higher energy. If A is negative, triplet is lower. \n\nWhat determines the sign of A? The nuclear magnetic moments are μ1 = g_p μ_N I1 and μ2 = g_p μ_N I2. The interaction energy is U = (μ0 / 4π r³) [ μ1·μ2 - 3 (μ1·r)(μ2·r)/r² ]. Substituting μ1 and μ2:\n\nU = (μ0 g_p² μ_N² / 4π r³) [ I1·I2 - 3 (I1·r̂)(I2·r̂) ]\n\nThe expectation value of this for the nuclear spin states. For the triplet state (I=1), the expectation value of I1·I2 is 0.25 ħ², and the expectation value of (I1·r̂)(I2·r̂) would depend on the spatial orientation. However, if the molecule is in a rotational state with J=0 (spherically symmetric), then the expectation value of (I1·r̂)(I2·r̂) would average to (1/3) I1·I2, since for any direction r̂, the average of (I·r̂)^2 is (1/3)I². So the expectation value of the interaction becomes:\n\nU = (μ0 g_p² μ_N² / 4π r³) [ ⟨I1·I2⟩ - 3 ⟨(I1·r̂)(I2·r̂)⟩ ]\n\n= (μ0 g_p² μ_N² / 4π r³) [ ⟨I1·I2⟩ - 3*(1/3)⟨I1·I2⟩ ]\n\n= (μ0 g_p² μ_N² / 4π r³) [ ⟨I1·I2⟩ - ⟨I1·I2⟩ ] = 0\n\nWait, that's zero? That can't be right. Maybe the angle-averaged dipole interaction cancels out. Then the contact term might dominate. But in the absence of a contact term (since nuclei are point dipoles and the electrons are not at the nucleus), maybe the dipole-dipole interaction averages to zero. Then the splitting must come from other effects, like the spin-rotation interaction or something else. \n\nAlternatively, in the hydrogen molecule, the dominant interaction between the nuclear spins is the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, but in the ground state with J=0 (rotational state), the angular part is isotropic, so the average of the dipole interaction might be zero. However, there's another effect: the Fermi contact interaction between the nuclei mediated by the electrons. Wait, but the nuclei are not overlapping, so the contact term (delta function) would be zero. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, the nuclear spin-spin interaction in H₂ is very small, but the splitting into ortho and para hydrogen is due to the symmetry requirements. The energy difference between ortho (triplet) and para (singlet) hydrogen comes from the rotational energy. Because para hydrogen (singlet nuclear spin) must have even rotational states, and ortho (triplet) must have odd rotational states. But in the ground rotational state (J=0), which is even, only para hydrogen can exist. Ortho hydrogen requires J odd, which is higher in energy. But the question is about the ground state being split into nuclear spin triplet and singlet. If the rotational ground state is J=0 (para), then the nuclear spin must be singlet. Wait, no. Wait, earlier analysis said that for J=0 (symmetric rotational), the nuclear spin must be symmetric (triplet). But that contradicts the usual para/ortho assignment. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's recall: in hydrogen molecule, para-hydrogen has nuclear spin singlet (antisymmetric) and even rotational states (J even), while ortho-hydrogen has nuclear spin triplet (symmetric) and odd rotational states (J odd). The lowest energy state is para-hydrogen with J=0 (even), nuclear spin singlet. But according to the earlier symmetry argument, for J=0 (symmetric rotational), the nuclear spin must be symmetric (triplet) to make the total wavefunction antisymmetric. But that contradicts. What's the mistake here?\n\nWait, let's re-examine the symmetry. The total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange of the two protons. The total wavefunction is the product of electronic, rotational, vibrational, and nuclear spin parts. \n\nElectronic: For H₂ in the ground state, the electrons are in a singlet spin state (antisymmetric) and the spatial part is symmetric (bonding orbital). So electronic part is antisymmetric (symmetric spatial × antisymmetric spin). \n\nVibrational: Ground state is symmetric (symmetric under exchange). \n\nRotational: For J even, the rotational wavefunction is symmetric; for J odd, antisymmetric. \n\nNuclear spin: Singlet (antisymmetric) or triplet (symmetric). \n\nSo the total wavefunction is electronic (antisymmetric) × vibrational (symmetric) × rotational (symmetric or antisymmetric) × nuclear spin (symmetric or antisymmetric). \n\nTo have the total wavefunction antisymmetric: \n\nAntisymmetric (electronic) × symmetric (vibrational) × rotational × nuclear spin = antisymmetric. \n\nSo electronic × vibrational = antisymmetric × symmetric = antisymmetric. \n\nThus, rotational × nuclear spin must be symmetric to get antisymmetric × symmetric = antisymmetric. \n\nTherefore, rotational and nuclear spin must be either both symmetric or both antisymmetric. \n\nSo:\n\n- If rotational is symmetric (even J), then nuclear spin must be symmetric (triplet). \n\n- If rotational is antisymmetric (odd J), then nuclear spin must be antisymmetric (singlet). \n\nBut this contradicts the standard para/ortho assignments. Wait, standard para-hydrogen is nuclear spin singlet (antisymmetric) with even J (symmetric rotational), which according to this would not be allowed, because rotational symmetric × nuclear spin antisymmetric = antisymmetric, and total would be antisymmetric × antisymmetric = symmetric. Wait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nTotal wavefunction = (electronic × vibrational) × (rotational × nuclear spin). \n\nElectronic × vibrational is antisymmetric × symmetric = antisymmetric. \n\nRotational × nuclear spin must be symmetric to make the total antisymmetric × symmetric = antisymmetric. \n\nTherefore, rotational and nuclear spin must have the same symmetry. \n\nSo:\n\n- If rotational is symmetric (even J), nuclear spin must be symmetric (triplet). \n\n- If rotational is antisymmetric (odd J), nuclear spin must be antisymmetric (singlet). \n\nTherefore, para-hydrogen (nuclear spin singlet) must have odd J, and ortho (triplet) must have even J. But traditionally, para-hydrogen has even J and singlet spin. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nAh! I think the mistake is in the symmetry of the electronic part. Let me double-check. The electronic wavefunction includes spatial and spin parts. For H₂, the ground electronic state is the singlet Σ state. The spatial part is symmetric under exchange (bonding orbital), and the spin part is antisymmetric (singlet). Therefore, the electronic wavefunction (spatial × spin) is symmetric × antisymmetric = antisymmetric. \n\nThe vibrational wavefunction is symmetric (ground state). \n\nThe rotational wavefunction for J even is symmetric, J odd antisymmetric. \n\nThe nuclear spin wavefunction is symmetric (triplet) or antisymmetric (singlet). \n\nSo total wavefunction: antisymmetric (electronic) × symmetric (vibrational) × rotational × nuclear spin. \n\nTo get total antisymmetric: antisymmetric × symmetric × (rotational × nuclear spin) = antisymmetric. \n\nThus, (rotational × nuclear spin) must be symmetric. \n\nTherefore:\n\n- If rotational is symmetric (even J), nuclear spin must be symmetric (triplet). \n\n- If rotational is antisymmetric (odd J), nuclear spin must be antisymmetric (singlet). \n\nThis means that ortho-hydrogen (triplet nuclear spin) has even J, and para-hydrogen (singlet) has odd J. But traditionally, para-hydrogen is the one with even J and lower energy. This suggests a mistake in the reasoning. \n\nWait, perhaps the rotational wavefunction's symmetry is different. For homonuclear diatomics, the rotational wavefunction symmetry depends on J. The rotational wavefunction is given by the spherical harmonics Y_J^M(θ, φ). Under exchange of the two nuclei (which is equivalent to inversion if the molecule is homonuclear), the rotational wavefunction picks up a phase of (-1)^J. Because exchanging the two nuclei is equivalent to a parity transformation, which changes θ → π - θ, φ → φ + π. The spherical harmonics transform as Y_J^M(π - θ, φ + π) = (-1)^J Y_J^M(θ, φ). Therefore, the rotational wavefunction is symmetric if J is even, antisymmetric if J is odd. \n\nTherefore, the rotational wavefunction symmetry is (-1)^J. \n\nThe nuclear spin wavefunction symmetry is (-1)^{I}, where I is the total nuclear spin. For triplet (I=1), it's symmetric (even I + 1?), wait. For two spin-1/2 nuclei, the total spin I can be 1 (triplet, symmetric) or 0 (singlet, antisymmetric). The symmetry of the nuclear spin wavefunction under exchange is (-1)^{I + 1}? Wait, for two fermions, the spin state with even I (I=1 is odd, since 1 is odd) no. Wait, the exchange of two spin-1/2 particles: the singlet (I=0) is antisymmetric, and the triplet (I=1) is symmetric. \n\nSo nuclear spin symmetry: singlet is antisymmetric (-1), triplet is symmetric (+1). \n\nThe total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. The total wavefunction is the product of electronic, vibrational, rotational, and nuclear spin parts. \n\nElectronic: antisymmetric. \n\nVibrational: symmetric. \n\nRotational: symmetry (-1)^J. \n\nNuclear spin: symmetry (-1)^{I} where I=0 (singlet) gives -1, I=1 (triplet) gives +1. \n\nSo the product must be antisymmetric: \n\nAntisymmetric (electronic) × symmetric (vibrational) × (-1)^J (rotational) × (-1)^{I} (nuclear spin) = (-1)^{J + I + 1} (since electronic contributes -1). \n\nWe need this product to be -1 (antisymmetric). Therefore:\n\n(-1)^{J + I + 1} = -1 → (-1)^{J + I} = 1 → J + I must be even. \n\nThus, J + I is even. \n\nIn the ground vibrational state (symmetric), the lowest rotational state is J=0. For J=0, I must be even. But I can be 0 or 1. Wait, J=0, so I must be even (0). Therefore, I=0 (singlet). \n\nFor J=1, I must be odd (1). So I=1 (triplet). \n\nThus, the lowest rotational state (J=0) must have I=0 (singlet), which is para-hydrogen. The next rotational state (J=1) must have I=1 (triplet), ortho-hydrogen. \n\nThe energy of the rotational states increases with J, so J=0 is lower than J=1. Therefore, the nuclear spin singlet state (para) has lower energy, and the triplet (ortho) has higher energy. \n\nBut the question states that the ground state is split into nuclear spin triplet and singlet. However, according to this, in the ground rotational state (J=0), only the singlet nuclear spin (para) is allowed. The triplet nuclear spin (ortho) requires J=1, which is higher in energy. Therefore, the splitting between the nuclear spin states is due to the rotational energy. But the question asks to show from first principles which state lies higher in energy. \n\nBut wait, the actual splitting between the nuclear spin states themselves (not due to rotation) would be due to the spin-spin interaction. However, the magnetic interaction between the nuclear spins is very small, but the main splitting comes from the rotational energy. In the context of the question, it's likely referring to the energy difference due to the nuclear spin coupling, not the rotational energy. \n\nAlternatively, the question might be considering the spin-spin interaction directly. If the nuclear spin triplet has higher energy due to the spin-spin interaction, then the triplet would be higher. But earlier analysis for the atomic case suggested that the triplet (parallel spins) have higher energy. \n\nBut in the molecular case, the interaction between the nuclear spins would be similar. If the interaction energy is proportional to I1·I2, then the triplet (I1·I2 = +0.25) would have higher energy than the singlet (I1·I2 = -0.75) if the constant is positive. \n\nAssuming the constant A is positive, then the triplet state (nuclear spin) would be higher in energy. However, in reality, the energy difference between ortho and para hydrogen is dominated by the rotational energy, not the direct nuclear spin-spin interaction. But the question asks to show from first principles which state lies higher. \n\nIf we consider only the spin-spin interaction, then the triplet (I=1) would be higher if the interaction energy is positive. But if the interaction is negative, the singlet would be higher. \n\nThe magnetic dipole interaction energy between two protons would be positive when the spins are parallel (triplet), leading to higher energy. But according to the dipole-dipole formula earlier, when aligned along the axis, parallel spins give lower energy. However, angle-averaged, the dipole interaction averages to zero. So perhaps the dominant term is the scalar spin-spin coupling, which is mediated by the electrons. This is similar to the hyperfine interaction in atoms but for nuclei in molecules. \n\nThe scalar coupling constant J (not to be confused with rotational quantum number) is such that the interaction energy is H = J I1·I2. If J is positive, triplet is higher. In molecules, the nuclear spin-spin coupling constant J is usually positive, leading to the triplet state being higher in energy. \n\nTherefore, the nuclear spin triplet state lies higher in energy than the singlet. \n\nBut in the case of hydrogen molecule, the dominant effect is the coupling between nuclear spin and rotation, leading to ortho and para states with different rotational energies. However, the question specifically asks about the splitting of the ground state into nuclear spin triplet and singlet, implying that the splitting is due to the nuclear spin interaction itself, not the rotational state. \n\nIf we ignore the rotational contribution and consider only the nuclear spin interaction, then the triplet state (I=1) would have higher energy if the spin-spin coupling is positive. Therefore, the answer would be that the triplet state lies higher in energy. \n\nBut I need to confirm. For part (b), the hydrogen molecule's ground state is split into nuclear spin triplet and singlet. Which is higher? \n\nFrom first principles, considering the symmetry and the spin-spin interaction:\n\nThe nuclear spin triplet (symmetric) must combine with rotational states of even J, which are lower in energy. Wait, no. Earlier analysis showed that for the ground state (J=0, even), the nuclear spin must be singlet. Therefore, the nuclear spin triplet is associated with higher rotational states (J=1), which are higher in energy. Therefore, the triplet state (ortho) is higher in energy than the singlet (para). \n\nThus, the answer for part (b) is that the nuclear spin triplet state lies higher in energy.\n</think>\n\n(a) The hyperfine splitting in the hydrogen atom's ground state arises from the interaction between the electron's and proton's magnetic moments. The electron and proton spins (both \\( S = \\frac{1}{2} \\)) combine to form total spin states \\( S_{\\text{total}} = 1 \\) (triplet) or \\( S_{\\text{total}} = 0 \\) (singlet). The hyperfine Hamiltonian \\( H_{\\text{hf}} \\propto \\mathbf{S}_e \\cdot \\mathbf{S}_p \\) has eigenvalues proportional to \\( S_{\\text{total}}(S_{\\text{total}} + 1) - \\frac{3}{2} \\). For the triplet (\\( S_{\\text{total}} = 1 \\)), the energy is higher than the singlet (\\( S_{\\text{total}} = 0 \\)) due to the positive coupling constant. Thus, the **triplet state lies higher in energy**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Triplet state (total spin 1) is higher in energy}}\n\\]\n\n(b) In the hydrogen molecule, the total nuclear spin states are \\( I_{\\text{total}} = 1 \\) (triplet) and \\( I_{\\text{total}} = 0 \\) (singlet). The total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under proton exchange. For the ground electronic state (symmetric spatial and antisymmetric spin), the nuclear spin symmetry must compensate for the rotational symmetry. In the lowest rotational state (\\( J = 0 \\), symmetric), the nuclear spin must be antisymmetric (singlet). Higher rotational states (\\( J = 1 \\), antisymmetric) require symmetric nuclear spin (triplet). The energy of the triplet state is higher due to its association with higher rotational energy. Additionally, the nuclear spin-spin interaction energy \\( \\propto \\mathbf{I}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{I}_2 \\) is positive for the triplet, further raising its energy. Thus, the **nuclear spin triplet state lies higher in energy**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Triplet nuclear spin state is higher in energy}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Triplet state (total spin 1) is higher in energy}", "\\text{Triplet nuclear spin state is higher in energy}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Triplet state (total spin 1) is higher in energy}", "expr2": "\\text{triplet } F = 1 \\text{ is an excited state and singlet } F = 0 \\text{ is the ground state}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Triplet nuclear spin state is higher in energy}", "expr2": "\\text{triplet } F = 1 \\text{ is an excited state and singlet } F = 0 \\text{ is the ground state}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-46", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these questions one by one. All of them are about photoionization, so I need to remember the basic concept here. Photoionization occurs when a photon has enough energy to eject an electron from an atom or ion. The key is that the photon's energy must be at least equal to the ionization energy of the atom or ion in its current state.\n\nStarting with part (a): Define the wavelength region capable of photoionizing a H atom in the ground level (n=1). \n\nFirst, the ionization energy for hydrogen in the ground state. The ionization energy is the energy required to remove the electron from n=1 to infinity. For hydrogen, the ionization energy can be calculated using the Rydberg formula. The formula for the energy levels in hydrogen is E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for n=1, E_1 = -13.6 eV. The ionization energy is the absolute value of that, so 13.6 eV. \n\nThe photon must have energy equal to or greater than 13.6 eV. Since energy and wavelength are inversely related via E = hc/λ, the wavelength must be shorter than or equal to the wavelength corresponding to 13.6 eV. \n\nCalculating the wavelength: λ = hc / E. Let's plug in the numbers. Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, speed of light c is 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. But converting eV to joules: 13.6 eV * 1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV = 2.178 x 10^-18 J. \n\nSo λ = (6.626e-34 * 3.00e8) / 2.178e-18 ≈ (1.9878e-25) / 2.178e-18 ≈ 9.12e-8 meters, which is 912 Angstroms (since 1 Å = 1e-10 m). So wavelengths shorter than or equal to 912 Å can photoionize a hydrogen atom in the ground state. Therefore, the region is λ ≤ 912 Å. \n\nWait, but the question says \"wavelength region capable of photoionizing\". So any photon with wavelength shorter than 912 Å (higher energy) will do. So the answer for part (a) is wavelengths less than or equal to 912 Angstroms.\n\nMoving to part (b): Photoionizing H atom in first excited level (n=2). \n\nHere, the electron is in n=2. The ionization energy from n=2 is lower. The energy at n=2 is E_2 = -13.6 eV / 4 = -3.4 eV. So the ionization energy needed is 3.4 eV. \n\nCalculating the corresponding wavelength: E = 3.4 eV. Converting to joules: 3.4 * 1.602e-19 = 5.4468e-19 J. \n\nλ = hc / E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 5.4468e-19 ≈ (1.9878e-25) / 5.4468e-19 ≈ 3.65e-7 meters = 3650 Angstroms. So wavelengths shorter than 3650 Å can photoionize. Therefore, the region is λ ≤ 3650 Å.\n\nBut wait, let me check. The ionization energy from n=2 is indeed 3.4 eV. So the threshold wavelength is 3650 Å. So any photon with wavelength shorter than that (higher energy) will ionize. So part (b) answer is λ ≤ 3650 Å.\n\nPart (c): Photoionizing He+ ion in ground level (n=1). \n\nHe+ is a hydrogen-like ion with atomic number Z=2. The energy levels for hydrogen-like atoms are given by E_n = -13.6 eV * Z² / n². For He+ (Z=2), n=1: E_1 = -13.6 * 4 / 1 = -54.4 eV. So ionization energy is 54.4 eV. \n\nCalculating the threshold wavelength: E = 54.4 eV. Convert to joules: 54.4 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.715e-18 J. \n\nλ = hc / E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 8.715e-18 ≈ (1.9878e-25) / 8.715e-18 ≈ 2.28e-8 meters = 228 Angstroms. So the threshold is 228 Å. Therefore, the wavelength region is λ ≤ 228 Å.\n\nPart (d): Photoionizing He+ ion in first excited level (n=2). \n\nAgain, He+ with n=2. The energy at n=2 is E_2 = -13.6 * 4 / 4 = -13.6 * 1 = -13.6 eV. So ionization energy is 13.6 eV. \n\nThreshold wavelength: same as part (a) for hydrogen? Because 13.6 eV. Let's check. \n\nE = 13.6 eV. So same calculation as part (a): λ = 912 Å. Wait, but wait, He+ in n=2: the ionization energy is 13.6 eV. So the threshold wavelength is 912 Å. Therefore, the region is λ ≤ 912 Å. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. For He+ in n=2, the ionization energy is the energy required to go from n=2 to infinity. The formula is E_n = -13.6 * Z² / n². So for He+ (Z=2), n=2: E_2 = -13.6 * (4) / 4 = -13.6 eV. So the ionization energy is 13.6 eV. Therefore, same as hydrogen's ground state. So the threshold wavelength is indeed 912 Å. So the answer is λ ≤ 912 Å. \n\nBut wait, that seems interesting. So He+ in n=2 requires same energy as H in n=1. That's correct because the Z²/n² factor. For He+ (Z=2), n=2: Z²/n² = 4/4 =1, same as H (Z=1, n=1: 1/1=1). So same ionization energy. Therefore, same threshold wavelength. \n\nSo summarizing:\n\n(a) λ ≤ 912 Å\n\n(b) λ ≤ 3650 Å\n\n(c) λ ≤ 228 Å\n\n(d) λ ≤ 912 Å\n\nI need to make sure all calculations are correct. Let me cross-verify.\n\nFor part (a): H n=1, ionization energy 13.6 eV. λ=hc/E. hc=12400 eV·Å (since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, but hc in eV·Å is approximately 12400). So 12400 / 13.6 ≈ 911.76 Å ≈ 912 Å. Correct.\n\nPart (b): H n=2, ionization energy 3.4 eV. 12400 / 3.4 ≈ 3647 Å ≈ 3650 Å. Correct.\n\nPart (c): He+ n=1, Z=2. Ionization energy 13.6 * 4 =54.4 eV. 12400 /54.4 ≈ 227.94 Å ≈ 228 Å. Correct.\n\nPart (d): He+ n=2, Z=2. Ionization energy 13.6 * (4)/4=13.6 eV. 12400 /13.6 ≈ 911.76 ≈ 912 Å. Correct.\n\nYes, all calculations check out.

{"id": "atomic/2-35", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these physics questions one by one. Starting with part (a): Why are heavy nuclei α-radioactive but stable against neutron-emission? Hmm. I remember that alpha decay involves emitting a helium nucleus, which is two protons and two neutrons. Heavy nuclei have a lot of protons, so the Coulomb repulsion is strong. The strong force is short-range, so in large nuclei, the Coulomb repulsion might make the nucleus unstable. But why alpha particles and not just neutrons?\n\nWait, the binding energy per nucleon might be a factor. For heavy nuclei, adding more neutrons might not help with stability because of the asymmetry term in the semi-empirical mass formula. But when they emit an alpha particle, they reduce both protons and neutrons, which could lower the overall energy. Also, the alpha particle is a very stable configuration due to its high binding energy. So emitting an alpha particle allows the nucleus to get closer to the valley of stability.\n\nNeutron emission would require the nucleus to have a very high neutron excess, but even then, the neutron is uncharged. However, the binding energy for a neutron might not be negative enough for spontaneous emission. In other words, the neutron separation energy is still positive in most cases, whereas alpha decay can occur when the binding energy released by emitting the alpha particle is sufficient to overcome the Coulomb barrier via quantum tunneling. So even though the Coulomb barrier is higher for alpha particles, the probability of tunneling is non-zero because the alpha particle has enough energy, and the process is favored energetically compared to neutron emission, which might not release energy. That makes sense. So heavy nuclei have higher Z, leading to higher Coulomb repulsion. The alpha decay reduces Z by 2 and N by 2, moving towards more stable isotopes. Neutron emission would only reduce N by 1, but if the nucleus is neutron-rich, maybe beta decay is more likely. But why not neutron emission? Because the neutron separation energy is still positive. Unless the nucleus is extremely neutron-rich, but even then, beta decay would convert a neutron to a proton, which might be more favorable. So heavy nuclei are more likely to undergo alpha decay to reduce Coulomb repulsion rather than neutron emission because the energy released in alpha decay is sufficient, and neutron emission isn't energetically favorable.\n\nMoving to part (b): Methods to determine nuclear radii. I know that electron scattering experiments are used. Electrons interact via the electromagnetic force, so by shooting high-energy electrons at nuclei and measuring the diffraction pattern, you can determine the charge distribution, which relates to the radius. Another method is using the muonic atom transitions. Muons are heavier than electrons, so they orbit closer to the nucleus, and their energy levels are more sensitive to the nuclear size. Measuring the X-rays emitted when muons transition between energy levels gives info about the nuclear radius. Also, in nuclear reactions, the cross-section can depend on the radius. For example, in proton-nucleus scattering, the interaction cross-section can be used to estimate the nuclear radius. Additionally, the liquid drop model gives a formula for nuclear radius based on mass number, R = r0 A^(1/3), but experimental methods like the ones above are used to determine r0 and actual radii. So the main methods are electron scattering, muonic atom spectroscopy, and cross-section measurements in scattering experiments.\n\nPart (c): Properties of nucleons in the lowest energy state. The lowest energy state would be the ground state. Nonclassical properties... Well, in quantum mechanics, the ground state has certain properties. For nucleons, the Pauli exclusion principle applies since they are fermions. So the system must have a filled Fermi sea, with all single-particle states filled up to the Fermi energy. Another property is pairing, leading to even-odd effects in binding energy. Even numbers of protons or neutrons are more stable due to pairing interactions. Also, the nucleus would have a certain spin and parity determined by the shell model. Nonclassical properties would include quantum states like superfluidity in nuclei, where nucleons form Cooper pairs and move without resistance. Also, the nucleus exhibits collective behaviors like vibrations or rotations, which are quantized, showing discrete energy levels. So the properties include a filled Fermi sea, pairing correlations, quantized angular momentum, and possibly superfluidity. These are all quantum mechanical in nature, not classical.\n\nPart (d): Fission cross-sections for uranium isotopes. The table shows thermal neutrons have high cross-sections for odd isotopes (231, 233, 235) and lower for even ones. Fast neutrons have cross-sections of a few barns and less even-odd effect. Thermal neutrons are low energy, so they need to be captured by the nucleus to induce fission. For even-even nuclei (even Z and even N), pairing energy makes them more stable. So when a thermal neutron is absorbed by an even-even nucleus (like U-234 + n → U-235), the resulting nucleus is odd-even (U-235 has Z=92 even? Wait, U-235 has 92 protons, which is even, but 235-92=143 neutrons, which is odd. Wait, the isotopes in the table: U-234 has 234-92=142 neutrons (even), U-235 has 143 (odd). So when a thermal neutron is absorbed by an even-even nucleus (like U-234), it becomes even-odd. But the cross-section for U-234 is zero. Wait, the cross-section here is for the isotope itself. So U-235 has a high cross-section for thermal neutrons. The even-odd effect is because even-even nuclei have higher fission barriers. When a nucleus has an odd neutron, it's easier to induce fission because the pairing energy is lower. Thermal neutrons are more likely to be captured by nuclei with an odd number of neutrons because adding a neutron would pair it up, releasing more energy (higher binding energy). So for even-N isotopes (like U-232, 234, 236), adding a neutron makes them odd-N, but maybe the fission barrier is higher? Wait, but the cross-section for U-235 is high. Wait, U-235 has 143 neutrons (odd). When it captures a thermal neutron, it becomes U-236 with 144 neutrons (even). But the cross-section for U-235 is 580 barns. Wait, maybe the key is that for thermal neutron-induced fission, the target nucleus must have an odd number of neutrons. Because when it absorbs a neutron, the resulting compound nucleus has even number, which has lower excitation energy needed for fission. Wait, the pairing energy. If the target nucleus has an odd number of neutrons, adding one more (thermal neutron) makes it even, which has higher binding energy. The extra binding energy contributes to the excitation energy, making fission more probable. So for even-N target nuclei, adding a neutron gives odd-N, which doesn't release as much pairing energy. Therefore, isotopes with odd N (like U-235: N=143) when they absorb a neutron become even-N (144), releasing more energy, which helps overcome the fission barrier. Hence, isotopes with odd N (like 235U) have higher thermal neutron fission cross-sections. The even isotopes (like 234U, 236U) have even N, so adding a neutron gives odd N, less energy released, so lower probability for fission. Hence the even-odd effect in thermal cross-sections. For fast neutrons, the neutron has enough energy to induce fission regardless of the pairing effects, so the cross-sections are lower and the even-odd effect is less pronounced. Fast neutrons don't rely on the binding energy gain from pairing, so the dependence on whether the target has even or odd N is smaller. Therefore, thermal neutrons' cross-sections are more sensitive to the target's neutron number parity, while fast neutrons' cross-sections depend more on the kinetic energy overcoming the fission barrier without needing the pairing energy boost.\n</think>\n\n(a) Heavy nuclei are α-radioactive due to the interplay between the short-range strong force and long-range Coulomb repulsion. As \\( Z \\) increases, Coulomb repulsion destabilizes the nucleus. Emitting an α particle (highly bound, \\( Z=2 \\), \\( N=2 \\)) reduces both \\( Z \\) and \\( N \\), lowering Coulomb energy and moving the nucleus closer to stability. Neutron emission is rare because the neutron separation energy remains positive in most nuclei, and β-decay (converting neutrons to protons) is often energetically favored over neutron loss. Additionally, α-decay benefits from quantum tunneling through the Coulomb barrier, which is feasible due to the α particle’s high binding energy.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{α-decay reduces Coulomb repulsion and leverages quantum tunneling;

{"id": "atomic/1-12", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve part (a) and (b) of this quantum mechanics problem. Let's start with part (a). The problem says that we have an atom with one valence electron in an l=1 level, ignoring spin. The external potential is given as V_pert = A x² + B y² - (A + B) z². We need to treat this as a perturbation and find how the l=1 level splits into three distinct levels, each with a wavefunction of the form Ψ = (αx + βy + γz)f(r). Then, for part (b), compute the expectation value of L_z for each level.\n\nFirst, for part (a), since the unperturbed state has l=1, which means the orbital angular momentum quantum number is 1. The degeneracy here is 2l+1 = 3, so threefold degenerate states. The perturbation will split this into three distinct levels. To find the energy shifts, we need to use degenerate perturbation theory. The key idea is to construct the matrix of the perturbing Hamiltonian in the subspace of the degenerate states and then diagonalize it. The eigenvalues will give the energy shifts, and the eigenvectors will give the coefficients α, β, γ for each level.\n\nThe unperturbed states for l=1 are the spherical harmonics Y_1^m, where m = -1, 0, +1. However, the problem mentions that the wavefunctions are of the form (αx + βy + γz)f(r). Since in the hydrogenic atom (or central potential), the real wavefunctions for l=1 are often expressed in terms of x, y, z multiplied by a radial function. For example, the p-orbitals are proportional to x/r, y/r, z/r times the radial part. So, the three unperturbed states can be taken as proportional to x f(r), y f(r), z f(r). Therefore, the basis states can be considered as |x>, |y>, |z> with the radial part factored out. Since the perturbation V_pert is a function of x², y², z², which are quadratic in coordinates, we need to compute the matrix elements of V_pert between these states.\n\nBut wait, in degenerate perturbation theory, the matrix elements are <i|V_pert|j>, where i and j are the basis states. Since the basis states are |x>, |y>, |z>, we need to compute the matrix elements of V_pert between these. However, since the perturbation is diagonal in position space, maybe the matrix will be diagonal? Let's think.\n\nWait, the states |x>, |y>, |z> are real functions (since they are proportional to x, y, z), so their overlaps with each other under the perturbation would depend on integrals involving x, y, z, and the perturbation. Let me recall that for the hydrogen atom, the real p-orbitals are:\n\npx: x f(r)\n\npy: y f(r)\n\npz: z f(r)\n\nSo, these are the three basis states. The perturbation V_pert is a function of x², y², z². So, when we compute the matrix elements <i|V_pert|j>, where i and j are px, py, pz, we need to compute integrals of x f(r) [V_pert] x f(r), etc. But since V_pert is quadratic in coordinates, and the wavefunctions are linear in coordinates times f(r), the integrals might simplify.\n\nBut perhaps even better: since the perturbation is V_pert = A x² + B y² - (A + B) z², which can be written as a combination of x², y², z² terms. Let's note that the unperturbed Hamiltonian is spherically symmetric, so the states |x>, |y>, |z> are degenerate. The perturbation breaks the spherical symmetry. The matrix elements of V_pert in the basis {x, y, z} will determine the splitting.\n\nBut let's compute the matrix elements. Let's denote the basis states as |x>, |y>, |z>. Then, the matrix elements are:\n\nH'_ij = <i| V_pert |j> = ∫ [i * V_pert * j] d³r\n\nSince i and j can be x, y, z multiplied by f(r). Let's note that f(r) is a common radial function, so perhaps the angular parts can be separated. Let's write each state as ψ_i = (x/r) f(r), similarly for y and z. Wait, but actually, the exact form of f(r) might not matter because when we compute the matrix elements, the angular integrals can be separated from the radial integrals. Let's see.\n\nBut maybe even better: since the perturbation V_pert is a quadratic function of coordinates, and the states are proportional to x, y, z, the integrals might involve terms like x * x² * x, etc. Wait, let's compute H'_xx = <x| V_pert |x> = ∫ (x f(r)) [A x² + B y² - (A + B) z²] (x f(r)) d³r\n\nSimilarly for H'_xy = <x| V_pert |y> = ∫ (x f(r)) [A x² + B y² - (A + B) z²] (y f(r)) d³r\n\nBut given the symmetry of the problem, perhaps the off-diagonal terms vanish. Let's check.\n\nFirst, note that the integral for H'_xx would be:\n\n∫ x f(r) [A x² + B y² - (A + B) z²] x f(r) d³r\n\n= ∫ x² f(r)^2 [A x² + B y² - (A + B) z²] d³r\n\nSimilarly, H'_xy would be:\n\n∫ x f(r) [A x² + B y² - (A + B) z²] y f(r) d³r\n\n= ∫ x y f(r)^2 [A x² + B y² - (A + B) z²] d³r\n\nNow, let's analyze the integrals. The integrand for H'_xy is x y multiplied by terms involving x², y², z². Let's consider the angular parts. The integral over all space can be separated into radial and angular parts. The angular integrals for terms like x y x² would involve integrating over angles. Let's recall that in spherical coordinates, integrals over products of coordinates can be evaluated using symmetry considerations.\n\nFor example, the integral of x y over the sphere is zero because of symmetry. Similarly, integrals of x y x² would be zero. Wait, let's see:\n\nConsider the term in H'_xy: A x² * x y = A x³ y. The integral over all angles of x³ y would be zero, because x³ y is an odd function in x (since x³ is odd and y is odd under x → -x, but actually, x³ y is odd under x → -x, y → y. So integrating over all x, y, z would give zero. Similarly, the term B y² * x y = B x y³. The integral of x y³ over all angles is zero, since it's odd in x and y. Similarly, the term - (A + B) z² * x y is proportional to x y z². The integral of x y z² over angles is zero, because x y is odd under x → -x or y → -y, but z² is even. So integrating over the sphere, for each term in H'_xy, the integral would be zero. Therefore, H'_xy = 0.\n\nSimilarly, all off-diagonal terms would vanish. Therefore, the perturbation matrix is diagonal in the |x>, |y>, |z> basis. Therefore, the matrix is diagonal with elements H'_xx, H'_yy, H'_zz.\n\nTherefore, the energy shifts are just the diagonal elements:\n\nΔE_x = H'_xx = ∫ x² f(r)^2 [A x² + B y² - (A + B) z²] d³r\n\nSimilarly for ΔE_y and ΔE_z.\n\nBut let's compute these integrals. Let's note that the integral can be separated into radial and angular parts. Let's write:\n\nΔE_x = ∫ [x² (A x² + B y² - (A + B) z²)] f(r)^2 d³r\n\n= A ∫ x⁴ f(r)^2 d³r + B ∫ x² y² f(r)^2 d³r - (A + B) ∫ x² z² f(r)^2 d³r\n\nSimilarly, for ΔE_y and ΔE_z, we would have:\n\nΔE_y = ∫ y² (A x² + B y² - (A + B) z²) f(r)^2 d³r\n\n= A ∫ y² x² f(r)^2 d³r + B ∫ y⁴ f(r)^2 d³r - (A + B) ∫ y² z² f(r)^2 d³r\n\nΔE_z = ∫ z² (A x² + B y² - (A + B) z²) f(r)^2 d³r\n\n= A ∫ z² x² f(r)^2 d³r + B ∫ z² y² f(r)^2 d³r - (A + B) ∫ z⁴ f(r)^2 d³r\n\nNow, due to the spherical symmetry of the unperturbed state, the integrals of x⁴, y⁴, z⁴ over the sphere are equal. Similarly, the integrals of x² y², x² z², y² z² are equal. Let's denote:\n\nI_4 = ∫ x⁴ f(r)^2 d³r = ∫ y⁴ f(r)^2 d³r = ∫ z⁴ f(r)^2 d³r\n\nI_22 = ∫ x² y² f(r)^2 d³r = ∫ x² z² f(r)^2 d³r = ∫ y² z² f(r)^2 d³r\n\nTherefore, we can express ΔE_x, ΔE_y, ΔE_z in terms of I_4 and I_22.\n\nSo:\n\nΔE_x = A I_4 + B I_22 - (A + B) I_22 = A I_4 + (B - A - B) I_22 = A I_4 - A I_22 = A (I_4 - I_22)\n\nSimilarly, ΔE_y = A I_22 + B I_4 - (A + B) I_22 = B I_4 + (A - A - B) I_22 = B I_4 - B I_22 = B (I_4 - I_22)\n\nΔE_z = A I_22 + B I_22 - (A + B) I_4 = (A + B) I_22 - (A + B) I_4 = (A + B)(I_22 - I_4)\n\nTherefore, the energy shifts are:\n\nΔE_x = A (I_4 - I_22)\n\nΔE_y = B (I_4 - I_22)\n\nΔE_z = - (A + B) (I_4 - I_22)\n\nBut since I_4 and I_22 are constants determined by the radial function f(r), the energy shifts are proportional to A, B, and -(A + B) respectively. Therefore, the three levels have energy shifts proportional to A, B, and -(A + B). The common factor is (I_4 - I_22), which is a positive constant (assuming I_4 > I_22, which is likely since x⁴ averages to a higher value than x² y²). However, since the problem states to express the shifts in terms of A and B up to a common factor, we can write the relative shifts as:\n\nΔE_x ∝ A\n\nΔE_y ∝ B\n\nΔE_z ∝ - (A + B)\n\nTherefore, the energy level diagram would have three levels: one shifted by +A (times a common factor), one by +B, and one by - (A + B). The actual coefficients would depend on the integral (I_4 - I_22), but since we are to express them in terms of A and B, we can ignore the common factor and just state the relative shifts as A, B, and -(A + B).\n\nNow, the wavefunctions for each level would correspond to the original basis states |x>, |y>, |z>, since the perturbation matrix is diagonal. Therefore, each level corresponds to one of the basis states, so the wavefunctions are proportional to x f(r), y f(r), z f(r). Therefore, the constants (α, β, γ) for each level are (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1) respectively. Wait, but the problem states that each level has a wavefunction of the form (αx + βy + γz)f(r). However, since the perturbation matrix is diagonal, the eigenstates are the original basis states themselves. Therefore, each eigenstate is just x f(r), y f(r), or z f(r), meaning that the coefficients are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). Therefore, the three levels correspond to these three directions.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"each has a wave function of the form Ψ = (αx + βy + γz)f(r)\", which is a linear combination. However, in our case, the eigenstates are the individual x, y, z components. So, perhaps the answer is that the three levels correspond to the x, y, and z directions, with energy shifts proportional to A, B, and -(A + B) respectively.\n\nTherefore, part (a) answer is that the energy shifts are proportional to A, B, and -(A + B). So the energy level diagram has three levels: one shifted by A, one by B, and one by -(A + B), all multiplied by a common factor (I_4 - I_22). But since the problem says to compute the shifts up to a common factor, we can write the relative shifts as ΔE_x = A, ΔE_y = B, ΔE_z = - (A + B), ignoring the common factor.\n\nNow, moving to part (b): compute the expectation value of L_z for each of the three levels.\n\nRecall that L_z is the angular momentum operator, which in position representation is -iħ (x ∂/∂y - y ∂/∂x). However, since we're dealing with wavefunctions of the form (αx + βy + γz)f(r), we need to compute <L_z> for each of these states.\n\nFirst, let's recall that for the standard angular momentum eigenstates Y_1^m, the expectation value of L_z is mħ. However, here the states are real combinations (x, y, z), which correspond to certain linear combinations of the Y_1^m states. For example, the real p-orbitals are:\n\npx: proportional to (Y_1^1 + Y_1^{-1})/√2\n\npy: proportional to (Y_1^1 - Y_1^{-1})/i√2\n\npz: proportional to Y_1^0\n\nIn such real orbitals, the expectation value of L_z is zero because they are superpositions of states with m and -m. For example, px and py are combinations of m=+1 and m=-1, so their expectation values of L_z would be zero. Similarly, pz corresponds to m=0, so <L_z> = 0.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, the wavefunctions are given as (αx + βy + γz)f(r). Let's consider each of the three eigenstates found in part (a):\n\n1. Ψ_x = x f(r) → α=1, β=0, γ=0\n\n2. Ψ_y = y f(r) → α=0, β=1, γ=0\n\n3. Ψ_z = z f(r) → α=0, β=0, γ=1\n\nWe need to compute <L_z> for each of these.\n\nLet's recall that L_z = x p_y - y p_x, where p_x is the momentum operator. Alternatively, in position representation, L_z = -iħ (x ∂/∂y - y ∂/∂x).\n\nBut since the wavefunctions are real functions (up to the radial part f(r), which is real), the expectation value of L_z might be zero. Because for real wavefunctions, the expectation value of an imaginary Hermitian operator like L_z would be zero. Let's verify this.\n\nFor a real wavefunction Ψ, the expectation value of L_z is:\n\n<Ψ| L_z |Ψ> = ∫ Ψ* (-iħ)(x ∂/∂y - y ∂/∂x) Ψ d³r\n\nBut since Ψ is real, Ψ* = Ψ. Therefore,\n\n= -iħ ∫ Ψ (x ∂Ψ/∂y - y ∂Ψ/∂x) d³r\n\nBut the integrand is real (since Ψ is real and derivatives are real), multiplied by -iħ, which is imaginary. Therefore, the integral is purely imaginary. However, since L_z is Hermitian, its expectation value must be real. The only way this can happen is if the integral is zero. Therefore, the expectation value is zero.\n\nTherefore, for each of the three states Ψ_x, Ψ_y, Ψ_z, which are real, the expectation value of L_z is zero.\n\nBut wait, let's check this explicitly for Ψ_x = x f(r).\n\nCompute <L_z> for Ψ_x:\n\n<L_z> = ∫ (x f(r)) * L_z (x f(r)) d³r\n\n= -iħ ∫ x f(r) [x ∂/∂y (x f(r)) - y ∂/∂x (x f(r))] d³r\n\nCompute each term inside the brackets:\n\nFirst term: x ∂/∂y (x f(r)) = x [x ∂f(r)/∂y] since x is treated as a variable. But ∂x/∂y = 0, so derivative of x f(r) with respect to y is x ∂f(r)/∂y.\n\nSecond term: - y ∂/∂x (x f(r)) = - y [f(r) + x ∂f(r)/∂x]\n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes:\n\n- iħ ∫ x f(r) [x x ∂f(r)/∂y - y (f(r) + x ∂f(r)/∂x)] d³r\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Let's simplify step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the terms:\n\nTerm1: x * x ∂f/∂y = x² ∂f/∂y\n\nTerm2: - y * f(r) - y x ∂f/∂x\n\nSo,\n\n<L_z> = -iħ ∫ x f(r) [x² ∂f/∂y - y f(r) - y x ∂f/∂x] d³r\n\nThis integral seems messy, but perhaps we can use symmetry arguments. Let's consider the angular parts.\n\nThe integrand involves terms like x² ∂f/∂y, y f(r), y x ∂f/∂x multiplied by x f(r). Let's note that f(r) is a radial function, so ∂f/∂y = (df/dr)(y/r), similarly for ∂f/∂x = (df/dr)(x/r).\n\nBut even without knowing the exact form of f(r), we can analyze the integrals over angles. Let's consider each term separately.\n\nFirst term: ∫ x f(r) * x² ∂f/∂y d³r\n\n= ∫ x³ f(r) ∂f/∂y d³r\n\nBut ∂f/∂y = (df/dr)(y/r). Therefore,\n\n= ∫ x³ f(r) (df/dr) (y/r) d³r\n\nThis integral involves x³ y / r times f(r) df/dr. The angular part of this integrand is x³ y / r. In spherical coordinates, x = r sinθ cosφ, y = r sinθ sinφ, z = r cosθ. Therefore, x³ y / r = r³ sin³θ cos³φ * r sinθ sinφ / r = r³ sin^4θ cos³φ sinφ. The integral over φ from 0 to 2π of cos³φ sinφ dφ is zero because it's an odd function in cosφ (since sinφ is multiplied by cos³φ). Therefore, the entire angular integral for the first term is zero.\n\nSecond term: ∫ x f(r) * (- y f(r)) d³r\n\n= - ∫ x y f(r)^2 d³r\n\nThe integrand is x y f(r)^2. The angular part is x y, which integrates to zero over the sphere because it's an odd function in both x and y. Therefore, this term is zero.\n\nThird term: ∫ x f(r) * (- y x ∂f/∂x) d³r\n\n= - ∫ x² y f(r) ∂f/∂x d³r\n\nAgain, ∂f/∂x = (df/dr)(x/r). Therefore,\n\n= - ∫ x² y f(r) (df/dr)(x/r) d³r\n\n= - ∫ x³ y / r f(r) df/dr d³r\n\nAgain, the angular part is x³ y / r, which as before, integrates to zero. Therefore, this term is also zero.\n\nTherefore, all three terms in the integral for <L_z> for Ψ_x are zero. Hence, <L_z> = 0.\n\nSimilarly, for Ψ_y = y f(r), the same logic applies. The integrand would involve terms like y² ∂f/∂y, which might not obviously be zero, but when considering the angular integrals, they would still vanish due to symmetry. For example, when computing <L_z> for Ψ_y:\n\n<L_z> = -iħ ∫ y f(r) [x ∂/∂y (y f(r)) - y ∂/∂x (y f(r))] d³r\n\nExpanding the terms:\n\nFirst term: x ∂/∂y (y f(r)) = x [f(r) + y ∂f/∂y]\n\nSecond term: - y ∂/∂x (y f(r)) = - y [y ∂f/∂x]\n\nSo,\n\n= -iħ ∫ y f(r) [x f(r) + x y ∂f/∂y - y² ∂f/∂x] d³r\n\nAgain, each term would involve integrals of x y f(r)^2, x y² ∂f/∂y, y³ ∂f/∂x, all of which have angular dependencies that integrate to zero. Therefore, <L_z> = 0.\n\nFor Ψ_z = z f(r):\n\n<L_z> = -iħ ∫ z f(r) [x ∂/∂y (z f(r)) - y ∂/∂x (z f(r))] d³r\n\nBut ∂/∂y (z f(r)) = z ∂f/∂y, and ∂/∂x (z f(r)) = z ∂f/∂x. Therefore,\n\n= -iħ ∫ z f(r) [x z ∂f/∂y - y z ∂f/∂x] d³r\n\n= -iħ ∫ z² f(r) [x ∂f/∂y - y ∂f/∂x] d³r\n\nAgain, substituting ∂f/∂y = (df/dr)(y/r) and ∂f/∂x = (df/dr)(x/r):\n\n= -iħ ∫ z² f(r) [x (df/dr)(y/r) - y (df/dr)(x/r)] d³r\n\n= -iħ ∫ z² f(r) (df/dr) [ (x y)/r - (y x)/r ] d³r\n\nBut the term inside the brackets is zero: (x y - y x)/r = 0. Therefore, the entire integral is zero. Hence, <L_z> = 0 for Ψ_z.\n\nTherefore, all three levels have <L_z> = 0.\n\nBut wait, this seems counterintuitive. If the original states are real combinations of angular momentum eigenstates, their expectation values of L_z should be zero. However, in the unperturbed state (without the external potential), the angular momentum is quantized, but when we have real wavefunctions (like px, py, pz), they are not eigenstates of L_z but rather superpositions of m=+1 and m=-1 (for px and py) and m=0 (for pz). Therefore, their expectation values of L_z are zero. So even though the perturbation splits the energy levels, the expectation value of L_z remains zero for each state. This is called angular momentum quenching because the orbital angular momentum's expectation value is zero in these real states, effectively \"quenching\" the angular momentum.\n\nTherefore, the answer to part (b) is that the expectation value of L_z for each of the three levels is zero.\n</think>\n\n(a) The $l=1$ level splits into three levels with energy shifts proportional to $A$, $B$, and $-(A+B)$. The wavefunctions correspond to $\\Psi_x = x f(r)$, $\\Psi_y = y f(r)$, and $\\Psi_z = z f(r)$, leading to energy shifts:\n\n- $\\Delta E_x \\propto A$  \n- $\\Delta E_y \\propto B$  \n- $\\Delta E_z \\propto -(A+B)$  \n\nThe energy level diagram shows three distinct levels shifted by these amounts relative to the original $l=1$ level.\n\n(b) The expectation value of $L_z$ for each level is zero. This arises because the wavefunctions are real combinations of angular momentum eigenstates, and the expectation value of $L_z$ (an imaginary Hermitian operator) vanishes for real wavefunctions.\n\n**Final Answers**\n\n(a) The energy shifts are:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Delta E_x \\propto A}, \\quad \\boxed{\\Delta E_y \\propto B}, \\quad \\boxed{\\Delta E_z \\propto -(A + B)}\n\\]\n\n(b) The expectation value of $L_z$ for each level is:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\langle L_z \\rangle = 0} \\quad \\text{for all three levels.}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\Delta E_x \\propto A", "\\Delta E_y \\propto B", "\\Delta E_z \\propto -(A + B)", "\\langle L_z \\rangle = 0"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\Delta E_x \\propto A", "expr2": "E_2 -

{"id": "atomic/1-15", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, part (a) asks about the splitting patterns for different polarizations of the beam. The particles have spin 1/2, so each can be either spin-up or spin-down along any given axis. The Stern-Gerlach apparatus here is oriented along the z-axis, meaning it will measure the z-component of the magnetic moment, μ_z. The splitting happens because the magnetic field gradient in the z-direction exerts a force proportional to μ_z, causing the particles to deflect up or down depending on their spin state.\n\nStarting with part (i): Beam polarized along +z direction. If the beam is already polarized along +z, then all the particles are in the spin-up state along z. When they pass through the Stern-Gerlach apparatus oriented along z, there's no splitting because they all have the same μ_z value. Wait, no, actually, the Stern-Gerlach splits them based on their μ_z. But if they're all polarized along +z, then every particle has μ_z = +μ (assuming μ is the magnitude). So the apparatus would just deflect all particles in the same direction? Wait, no. Wait, the Stern-Gerlach usually splits into two beams for spin-1/2 particles. But if they are all in the +z eigenstate, then shouldn't they all go into the +z beam, so no splitting? So the pattern would be a single beam, no splitting. That makes sense. Because if the spin is already aligned with the measurement axis, the SG apparatus just lets them through without splitting.\n\nPart (ii): Beam polarized along +x direction. The spin state here is an eigenstate of S_x, not S_z. When you measure S_z on a state that's an eigenstate of S_x, the result is a superposition of the S_z eigenstates. For spin-1/2 particles, the eigenstates of S_x can be written as a combination of |+z> and |-z> states. Specifically, the |+x> state is (|+z> + |-z>)/√2. So when you pass this through the SG apparatus oriented along z, it should split into two beams, corresponding to +z and -z. So the pattern here would be two beams, split along the z-axis. The intensities should be equal because the probabilities for each are 50-50.\n\nPart (iii): Beam polarized along +y direction. Similar to part (ii), but the state is an eigenstate of S_y. The |+y> state can be written as (|+z> + i|-z>)/√2. Again, when measured in the z-direction, this is a superposition of the two eigenstates. So the SG apparatus along z would split the beam into two, with equal probabilities. So again, two beams, same as (ii). The difference between x and y polarization isn't observable in the z-measurement because the relative phase (the i in the y case) doesn't affect the probabilities, which are the square of the modulus. So the splitting pattern here is also two beams, same as (ii).\n\nPart (iv): Unpolarized beam. An unpolarized beam is a statistical mixture of spin states. For spin-1/2, this would mean that half the particles are in |+z> and half in |-z>, but in a mixed state rather than a coherent superposition. When passed through the SG apparatus along z, this would split into two beams with equal intensity. So the pattern is two beams, same as (ii) and (iii). But wait, how does this differ from the polarized cases? In the polarized cases (ii) and (iii), the beam is in a pure state, but when measured in z, it splits into two. For the unpolarized case, it's a mixed state, but the result is the same: two beams with equal intensity. So the splitting pattern is the same as (ii) and (iii).\n\nSo summarizing part (a):\n\n(i) Single beam (no splitting).\n\n(ii) Two beams.\n\n(iii) Two beams.\n\n(iv) Two beams.\n\nNow part (b) asks about cases with indistinguishable results and how to distinguish them. From part (a), cases (ii), (iii), and (iv) all result in two beams. But (ii) and (iii) are pure states polarized along x and y, while (iv) is a mixed state. So how can we tell them apart?\n\nFirst, to distinguish between a pure state polarized along x or y versus an unpolarized (mixed) state. For the pure states (ii and iii), if we take one of the split beams (say the +z beam) and measure it again along the same z-axis, it should remain in the +z state. But if the original was a mixed state, then each particle is already in a definite z state, so filtering the +z beam and measuring again would still give +z. Wait, but in the pure state case (like |+x>), after measuring z and getting +z, the state collapses to |+z>, so subsequent measurements along z would stay. But in the mixed state, the particles are already in either |+z> or |-z>, so after selecting the +z beam, they are all |+z>. So in both cases, a second SG along z would not split. Hmm, so that doesn't help.\n\nWait, but maybe if we use a different orientation. For example, take the beam that was split in the z-direction (cases ii, iii, iv), and then pass one of the resulting beams through another SG apparatus oriented along x or y. Let's think.\n\nTake case (ii): original state |+x>. After passing through SG-z, the beam splits into |+z> and |-z>, each with 50% probability. Suppose we take the |+z> beam. Now, if we pass this through an SG-x apparatus, what happens? The |+z> state can be written as (|+x> + |-x>)/√2. So the SG-x would split into two beams. Similarly, if the original was |+x>, then after selecting |+z>, the state is |+z>, which when measured along x gives 50-50. But if the original was an unpolarized beam (case iv), then after selecting |+z>, it's a pure |+z> state, same as in case (ii). Wait, but in case (iv), the original beam is a mixture, but after selecting |+z>, it's a pure state. So perhaps this approach doesn't distinguish between (ii) and (iv).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to consider the coherence. For example, if the original state is a pure state like |+x> or |+y>, then even though the SG-z splits it into two, those beams have coherence. If we recombine the beams without disturbing the phase, we could get interference effects. But the mixed state (unpolarized) doesn't have such coherence. However, Stern-Gerlach apparatuses typically don't recombine beams, so maybe that's not practical.\n\nAlternatively, to distinguish between |+x> and |+y>, which both split into two in SG-z, but their states differ in phase. How can we tell them apart? If after the SG-z, we apply a magnetic field to rotate the spin, or use another SG apparatus in a different direction. For example, take the beam that was split into |+z> and |-z> in case (ii) or (iii). If we take one of those beams (say |+z>) and pass it through an SG-x or SG-y apparatus.\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose we have a beam that was originally polarized along +x. After passing through SG-z, we get two beams: |+z> and |-z>. Let's take the |+z> beam. The state |+z> can be expressed in the x-basis as (|+x> + |-x>)/√2. So if we pass this through an SG-x, it will split into |+x> and |-x> with equal probability. Similarly, if the original state was |+y>, then the |+z> state can be written in the y-basis as (|+y> + i|-y>)/√2. If we pass this through an SG-y, it would split into |+y> and |-y> with equal probability. But how does that help us distinguish between x and y polarization?\n\nAlternatively, if after the initial SG-z, we use another SG apparatus in a different direction. Let's say we first split the beam into +z and -z. Then, take one of those beams and pass it through an SG-x. For the original |+x> state, the |+z> component is (|+x> + |-x>)/√2, so SG-x would split into two. Similarly, for the original |+y> state, the |+z> component is (|+y> + i|-y>)/√2, so passing through SG-y would split into two. But if we use SG-x on the |+z> beam from original |+y>, what happens? Let's compute.\n\nThe |+z> state in terms of |+y> and |-y> is (|+y> + i|-y>)/√2. If we now measure S_x on this state, we need to express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+x> and |-x>. The eigenstates of S_y can be written as:\n\n|+y> = (|+z> + i|-z>)/√2,\n\nbut maybe I need to express |+y> in terms of |+x> and |-x>. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use rotation operators. Alternatively, recall that the eigenstates of S_x are (|+z> + |-z>)/√2 and (|+z> - |-z>)/√2. Similarly, eigenstates of S_y are (|+z> + i|-z>)/√2 and (|+z> - i|-z>)/√2.\n\nWait, but if we have a state |+z> and we want to express it in the S_x basis, then:\n\n|+z> = (|+x> + |-x>)/√2.\n\nSimilarly, if we have |+z> and measure S_x, it's a 50-50 split. But if the original state was |+y>, then after selecting |+z>, it's |+z>, which when measured in x is still 50-50. Hmm, maybe this isn't helping.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the original polarization along x or y leads to different phases in the components when measured along z. But when you do a subsequent measurement along a different axis, the interference effects depend on the relative phase. For example, if after splitting in z, you recombine the beams and then measure along x or y, you could see interference. But Stern-Gerlach apparatuses don't usually recombine beams, so this might not be feasible without additional equipment like a second SG with opposite gradient or some kind of phase shifter.\n\nAlternatively, consider using a spin rotator. For instance, a magnetic field in a certain direction can rotate the spin state. Suppose after the initial SG-z, we apply a magnetic field to rotate the spin around the y-axis by 90 degrees, converting the |+z> state to |+x>, and then measure again along z. But this requires additional equipment (the magnetic field for rotation), which the problem allows as \"possibly some additional equipment\".\n\nAlternatively, to distinguish between the pure states (ii and iii) and the mixed state (iv), we can check if the beam is in a pure state. For example, if we take the two beams from SG-z (in cases ii, iii, iv) and then pass each through another SG apparatus oriented along x. For the pure state cases (ii and iii), each of the split beams (|+z> and |-z>) will split again into x. But for the mixed state (iv), each split beam is already in a definite z state, so passing through SG-x would split each into two. Wait, but in both cases, after the first SG-z, the beams are in |+z> or |-z>, which are not eigenstates of S_x. So whether the original was a pure state or mixed, after selecting |+z>, the state is |+z>, which when passed through SG-x would split into two. So that doesn't help.\n\nWait, maybe the difference is in the coherence. If the original state is a pure state like |+x>, then the two beams after SG-z are entangled in a way, but since we're dealing with a beam, each particle is in either |+z> or |-z>, but as a pure state. Wait, no. If the original state is |+x>, then each particle is in a superposition of |+z> and |-z>, but upon measurement, collapses to one or the other. So after SG-z, each particle is in |+z> or |-z>, but the ensemble is a mixture of those states. Wait, but that's the same as the unpolarized case. Wait, no. The unpolarized case is a statistical mixture from the start, while the pure state case becomes a statistical mixture after measurement. So in both cases, after SG-z, the beams are in mixed states. So maybe there's no way to distinguish them just by measuring again in another direction. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a series of Stern-Gerlach apparatuses. For example, in the case of the original |+x> state, if we first pass through SG-z, split into |+z> and |-z>, then recombine the beams (without observing which path they took), and then pass through SG-x, we would get a single beam again because the recombination would restore the |+x> state. But this requires a way to recombine the beams coherently, which is not standard for Stern-Gerlach apparatuses since they spatially separate the beams. So this might require additional equipment to recombine them, which the problem allows.\n\nSimilarly, for the |+y> state, after splitting into |+z> and |-z>, recombining them, and passing through SG-y would restore the original state. But if the original was a mixed state (unpolarized), then even after recombination, it would remain a mixed state and split in any subsequent SG measurement.\n\nBut this approach requires the ability to recombine the beams, which might involve some magnetic fields or other equipment to bring the separated beams back together without losing coherence. If such equipment is allowed, then this could distinguish between the pure and mixed cases.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to rotate the spin before measurement. For example, take the original beam and first pass it through a magnetic field that causes a spin rotation. Suppose we rotate the spin by 90 degrees around the y-axis, converting |+x> to |+z>, and then measure along z. If the original was |+x>, after rotation, it becomes |+z>, so SG-z would show a single beam. Similarly, if the original was |+y>, a rotation might convert it to a different state. But this requires knowing the rotation needed, which depends on the original polarization.\n\nAlternatively, use a series of SG measurements. For example, if the beam is polarized along +x, then measuring SG-x would not split it, but measuring SG-z does. Similarly, if it's polarized along +y, SG-y wouldn't split it. So to distinguish between x, y, and unpolarized, you could rotate the apparatus to a different axis.\n\nBut the problem states that we can use the above Stern-Gerlach apparatus (which is along z) and possibly additional equipment. So additional equipment might include another SG apparatus oriented along a different axis, or a spin rotator.\n\nSo, for cases (ii), (iii), and (iv), which all produce two beams along z, to distinguish between them:\n\n- For case (ii): original state |+x>. If we take one of the split beams (say |+z>) and pass it through an SG apparatus oriented along x, it should split into two beams (since |+z> is a superposition of |+x> and |-x>).\n\n- For case (iii): original state |+y>. Take the |+z> beam and pass through SG-y, it should split into two.\n\n- For case (iv): unpolarized. After selecting |+z>, passing through any other SG would split, but the original distinction is that the unpolarized is a mixed state. However, once you select a |+z> beam, it's a pure state, so this might not help.\n\nWait, but the difference between (ii)/(iii) and (iv) is that in (ii)/(iii), the original beam is a pure state, while (iv) is a mixed state. However, after passing through SG-z and selecting one beam, all three cases result in a pure |+z> state. So this approach doesn't distinguish them.\n\nAlternatively, consider not selecting a single beam but using the entire original beam. For example, if the original beam is polarized along +x, then passing it through an SG-x apparatus would not split it. Similarly for +y. But the problem states that the given apparatus is along z. So to use another orientation, you'd need additional SG apparatuses along x or y.\n\nThe problem allows using \"possibly some additional equipment\", which could include another SG apparatus oriented along a different axis. So to distinguish between cases (ii), (iii), and (iv), you could:\n\n- For case (ii): After the initial SG-z splits into two beams, if you rotate the apparatus to x (using additional equipment), the original |+x> state would not split in SG-x.\n\nWait, but the original beam after SG-z has been split into |+z> and |-z>. If you recombine those beams (which requires additional equipment to do coherently), then passing through SG-x would show no splitting if the original was |+x>. But without recombination, each beam is in |+z> or |-z>, which would split in SG-x.\n\nAlternatively, if you have the original beam (before any SG-z) and can rotate it, you could first pass it through an SG-x apparatus. If it's polarized along +x, it won't split. But the problem states that the given apparatus is along z. So maybe the solution is to use a different orientation of the SG apparatus, which would require additional equipment (another SG apparatus).\n\nAlternatively, use a spin flipper or a magnetic field to rotate the spin direction. For example, apply a π/2 rotation around the y-axis to convert |+x> to |+z>, then measure along z. If the original was |+x>, after rotation it becomes |+z>, so SG-z shows a single beam. Similarly, a |+y> state rotated appropriately might behave differently.\n\nBut this requires a spin rotator, which is additional equipment. The problem allows this, so the answer would involve using such a rotation before measurement.\n\nSo, to distinguish between the cases:\n\n- For (ii) vs (iii): Both produce two beams in SG-z. To tell them apart, rotate the spin by 90 degrees around the z-axis (using a magnetic field), which would convert |+x> to |+y> or vice versa, and then measure with SG-z again. Wait, no. A rotation around z would affect the phase between |+z> and |-z>. Alternatively, rotate the spin so that the original x or y polarization is aligned along z, then measure.\n\nAlternatively, pass the original beam through an SG apparatus oriented along x or y. For example, if the original beam is polarized along +x, then an SG-x would not split it, whereas an SG-y would split it. But the problem states that the given apparatus is along z, so using another orientation is additional equipment.\n\nThus, the answer for part (b) is that cases (ii), (iii), and (iv) produce indistinguishable splitting patterns (two beams), but they can be distinguished by using additional SG apparatuses oriented along different axes (like x or y) or by applying spin rotations before measurement.\n\nFor example:\n\n- To distinguish between (ii) and (iii), pass the original beam through an SG-x apparatus. If it's polarized along +x, it won't split; if it's polarized along +y, it will split into two.\n\n- To distinguish between pure states (ii or iii) and the mixed state (iv), check if the beam is in a pure state by measuring in a different basis after rotation. A pure state will show interference effects when rotated appropriately, while a mixed state won't.\n\nBut since the problem allows using additional equipment, the key idea is to use SG apparatuses in different orientations or spin rotations to determine the original polarization.\n</think>\n\n(a) The splitting patterns for each case are as follows:\n\n(i) **Beam polarized along +z direction**:  \nThe particles are already in eigenstates of \\( S_z \\).

{"id": "atomic/2-32", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to explain why in lighter nuclei, the number of protons and neutrons are roughly equal, but in heavier nuclei, there are more neutrons than protons. Also, why removing a proton from a heavy nucleus requires more energy than removing a neutron. All this assuming that the nuclear forces between all pairs of nucleons are exactly equal. Hmm, let's start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that nuclei are held together by the strong nuclear force, which acts between all nucleons—protons and neutrons. But protons also have electric charge, so they repel each other due to the electromagnetic force. The nuclear force is short-range and stronger than the electromagnetic force at very short distances, which is why nuclei stay together despite the protons repelling each other.\n\nIn lighter nuclei, since they are small, all the nucleons are close enough that the strong force can effectively hold them together. But as the nucleus gets bigger, the electromagnetic repulsion between protons becomes more significant because the protons are farther apart, and the strong force's reach is limited. So maybe in heavier nuclei, adding more neutrons helps because neutrons contribute to the strong force without adding electric charge. That would increase the nuclear binding without increasing repulsion. Hence, more neutrons than protons in heavy nuclei.\n\nBut why exactly does the number of neutrons need to exceed protons? Let's think about the stability. For a heavy nucleus with many protons, the Coulomb repulsion becomes a big problem. Adding neutrons increases the strong force binding the nucleus together without adding to the repulsion. However, there's a limit because neutrons are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle too. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has to occupy its own quantum state. So if you have too many neutrons compared to protons, you might fill up the neutron energy levels more, leading to instability again. But the balance tips towards more neutrons because the Coulomb repulsion is a long-range force and gets stronger with more protons.\n\nNow, the second part: why removing a proton requires more energy than a neutron in heavy nuclei. If the nuclear forces are the same, then the difference must come from something else. Since protons are charged, their removal would require overcoming both the nuclear binding energy and the Coulomb barrier. Wait, but when you remove a proton, you have to not only break the nuclear bonds but also work against the electric repulsion from the other protons. Wait, but in the nucleus, the protons are already in a potential well due to the nuclear force. To remove a proton, you need to give it enough energy to escape both the nuclear attraction and the Coulomb repulsion from the rest of the nucleus. Wait, actually, the Coulomb potential outside the nucleus is repulsive for protons. So the potential barrier for a proton is higher. But how does that relate to the binding energy?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the binding energy for protons is less than for neutrons in heavy nuclei because the Coulomb repulsion reduces the net binding for protons. Let me think. The total binding energy comes from the strong force minus the electromagnetic repulsion for protons. So protons have an additional repulsive term. Therefore, the binding energy per proton would be less than that per neutron. Hence, it's easier to remove a neutron because they are less tightly bound? Wait, but the question says that more energy is required to remove a proton. That seems contradictory. Wait, the problem states that for heavy nuclei, more energy is required to remove a proton than a neutron. But if protons are less tightly bound because of Coulomb repulsion, then they should be easier to remove. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this backwards.\n\nWait, the binding energy is the energy required to remove a nucleon. So higher binding energy means more energy is needed. If protons have lower binding energy due to Coulomb repulsion, then they should require less energy to remove. But the question says the opposite. So there must be another factor here.\n\nWait, maybe the Coulomb repulsion actually makes the protons sit in a higher potential energy state. So when you remove a proton, you have to not only overcome the nuclear attraction but also the fact that the remaining protons are now in a lower potential energy state. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe binding energy is the difference in energy between the nucleus and the separated nucleons. For a proton, the binding energy would be the energy required to remove it from the nucleus. If the Coulomb repulsion makes the nucleus less stable, then the binding energy for protons would be lower. Therefore, it would take less energy to remove a proton. But the problem states that more energy is required. So this contradicts. Therefore, my reasoning must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the Coulomb repulsion affects the potential well. Protons in the nucleus experience both the attractive nuclear potential and the repulsive Coulomb potential. The total potential for a proton is thus a combination of these. The nuclear potential is a deep well, but the Coulomb potential adds a repulsive term, which is more significant for heavy nuclei. So the effective potential well for protons is shallower than that for neutrons. Therefore, the protons are less tightly bound, meaning lower binding energy, so less energy required to remove them. But the problem says the opposite. Hmm. There's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the asymmetry energy in the semi-empirical mass formula. The semi-empirical formula includes terms for volume, surface, Coulomb, asymmetry, and pairing. The asymmetry term penalizes having an unequal number of protons and neutrons. For heavy nuclei, the Coulomb term makes it favorable to have more neutrons to reduce the repulsion. The asymmetry term is proportional to (N-Z)^2/A. So to minimize the total energy, there's a balance between the Coulomb repulsion (favoring more neutrons) and the asymmetry term (penalizing unequal numbers). For heavy nuclei, the Coulomb term dominates, leading to N > Z.\n\nBut how does this relate to the energy required to remove a proton vs. a neutron? The binding energy per nucleon is given by the semi-empirical formula. For a proton, the Coulomb term reduces its binding energy compared to a neutron. Therefore, the separation energy (energy required to remove a nucleon) would be lower for protons. But the problem states that more energy is required to remove a proton. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the Coulomb barrier is different. Even if the binding energy is lower for protons, the actual energy required to remove them might be higher because of the Coulomb barrier. Wait, but separation energy is the energy needed to remove a nucleon from the nucleus. If the binding energy is lower, the separation energy should be lower. But maybe in heavy nuclei, the protons are in a higher energy state due to the Coulomb repulsion, so removing them requires more energy? That doesn't make sense. Let me check some numbers.\n\nTake lead-208, which has 82 protons and 126 neutrons. The binding energy per nucleon is around 7.87 MeV. But protons have Coulomb repulsion. The Coulomb term in the semi-empirical formula is a positive term that reduces the binding energy. So the binding energy for protons would be less than for neutrons. Therefore, the separation energy for a proton should be less than for a neutron. But experimentally, for heavy nuclei like lead, the neutron separation energy is lower than the proton separation energy. Wait, is that true?\n\nWait, let me look up some data. For example, in lead-208, the neutron separation energy is about 8 MeV, and the proton separation energy is around 8.5 MeV. Wait, so protons actually have higher separation energy. That contradicts my previous reasoning. So why is that?\n\nAh, maybe because the protons are in a lower energy state due to the Coulomb repulsion. Wait, no. The Coulomb repulsion would make the protons have higher potential energy. So when you remove a proton, you take it from a higher potential energy state to a lower one (free proton at rest). Wait, but the binding energy is the energy required to remove it. If the proton is in a higher potential energy state in the nucleus, then removing it would release energy, meaning the binding energy is negative. But binding energy is positive when the nucleus is bound. I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Coulomb repulsion makes the nucleus less bound, but the actual separation energy for protons is higher because of the Coulomb barrier. Wait, the separation energy is the energy required to remove a nucleon. If the protons are less bound, then the separation energy should be lower. But in reality, for heavy nuclei, the proton separation energy is higher. So there must be another factor.\n\nWait, perhaps the asymmetry term. The asymmetry term in the binding energy formula is a penalty for having N ≠ Z. If a nucleus has more neutrons, adding another neutron would increase the asymmetry, while adding a proton would decrease it. But when you remove a proton from a neutron-rich nucleus, you make the nucleus even more neutron-rich, increasing the asymmetry penalty. Therefore, the energy required to remove a proton would be higher because it would lead to a more asymmetric nucleus, which is less favorable. Similarly, removing a neutron from a neutron-rich nucleus would decrease the asymmetry, making it more favorable, hence requiring less energy.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So the asymmetry energy term explains why removing a proton (which would increase N-Z) requires more energy than removing a neutron (which would decrease N-Z). Therefore, even though the Coulomb repulsion reduces the binding energy of protons, the asymmetry energy makes it energetically more costly to remove a proton because it worsens the N/Z ratio.\n\nSo putting it all together: For light nuclei, the Coulomb repulsion is not significant, so N ≈ Z to minimize the asymmetry energy. For heavy nuclei, Coulomb repulsion becomes significant, so more neutrons are added to reduce the repulsion, despite the asymmetry penalty. When removing a nucleon, removing a proton increases the asymmetry (since N-Z becomes larger), so the energy required is higher due to the increased asymmetry energy. Removing a neutron decreases the asymmetry, so less energy is needed. Therefore, even though protons are less tightly bound due to Coulomb repulsion, the asymmetry energy makes their removal require more energy.\n\nSo the key points are:\n\n1. Coulomb repulsion in heavy nuclei leads to more neutrons to reduce repulsion.\n2. Asymmetry energy penalizes unequal numbers of protons and neutrons.\n3. Removing a proton increases asymmetry, requiring more energy; removing a neutron decreases asymmetry, requiring less energy.\n\nTherefore, even with equal nuclear forces between all nucleon pairs, the Coulomb repulsion and asymmetry energy explain the observations.\n</think>\n\nFor light nuclei, the balance between protons and neutrons is maintained because the Coulomb repulsion between protons is relatively weak compared to the strong nuclear force. The strong force, which acts equally between all nucleon pairs (proton-proton, neutron-neutron, proton-neutron), dominates, favoring a roughly equal number of protons and neutrons to minimize the asymmetry energy. The asymmetry energy term in the nuclear binding energy penalizes deviations from \\( N \\approx Z \\), ensuring stability for light nuclei.\n\nIn heavy nuclei, the Coulomb repulsion between protons becomes significant due to the larger number of protons. To counteract this repulsion, more neutrons are added. Neutrons contribute to the strong nuclear force without adding Coulomb repulsion, thereby stabilizing the nucleus. However, this introduces an asymmetry penalty (\\( N > Z \\)), which is outweighed by the reduction in Coulomb energy. The equilibrium \\( N/Z \\) ratio thus shifts toward more neutrons as the nucleus grows heavier.\n\nWhen removing a nucleon from a heavy nucleus, two factors determine the energy required:\n1. **Coulomb Repulsion**: Protons experience a repulsive Coulomb potential, reducing their effective binding energy compared to neutrons. However, the asymmetry energy plays a critical role.\n2. **Asymmetry Energy**: Removing a proton increases the neutron excess (\\( N-Z \\)), worsening the asymmetry penalty. This requires additional energy to overcome the increased asymmetry energy. Conversely, removing a neutron reduces \\( N-Z \\), lessening the asymmetry penalty and requiring less energy.\n\nThus, even though protons are less tightly bound due to Coulomb repulsion, the asymmetry energy makes proton removal energetically more costly. This explains why heavy nuclei require more energy to remove a proton than a neutron.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Coulomb repulsion in heavy nuclei favors more neutrons, while asymmetry energy increases the energy required to remove protons.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Coulomb repulsion in heavy nuclei favors more neutrons, while asymmetry energy increases the energy required to remove protons.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Coulomb repulsion in heavy nuclei favors more neutrons, while asymmetry energy increases the energy required to remove protons.}", "expr2": "S_p - S_n \\approx 5.5 \\times 10^{-3} A^{4/3}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-23", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the typical cross section for low-energy electron-atom scattering. The options given are 10^-16, 10^-24, 10^-32, 10^-40 cm². Hmm, cross sections in physics usually relate to the probability of a scattering event happening. Let me recall what I know about cross-sectional areas for different types of interactions.\n\nFirst, I remember that cross sections can vary widely depending on the energy of the particles and the type of interaction. For example, nuclear reactions have much smaller cross sections compared to atomic interactions. But here it's about electron-atom scattering at low energy. So electrons interacting with atoms—probably elastic scattering since it's low energy, maybe like Rutherford scattering but adjusted for different factors.\n\nWait, Rutherford scattering cross section formula is something like (Z²α²ħ²)/(4m²v⁴) or similar, but that's for Coulomb scattering. However, at low energies, electrons might not penetrate the atom much because their kinetic energy is low. Atoms have sizes on the order of angstroms, which is 10^-8 cm. The cross-sectional area would be πr², so π*(1e-8 cm)² ≈ 3e-16 cm². Wait, that's around 1e-16 cm². But wait, that's the geometric cross-section. But scattering cross sections can be larger or smaller depending on the interaction.\n\nBut wait, the typical size of an atom is about 1 angstrom in radius, so area is π*(1e-8 cm)^2 ≈ 3.14e-16 cm². So that would be around 1e-16 cm². But maybe for low-energy electrons, the cross section is similar to the atomic size. But I also remember that cross sections for electron scattering can be different. For example, the cross section for Thomson scattering is about 6.65e-25 cm² (since the Thomson cross section is ~6.65e-29 m², which converts to 6.65e-25 cm² because 1 m² = 1e4 dm² = 1e4 * 1e2 cm² = 1e4*1e2=1e6 cm²? Wait, no. Wait, 1 m² is (100 cm)^2 = 10^4 cm². So 1 m² = 1e4 cm². Therefore, 6.65e-29 m² is 6.65e-29 * 1e4 cm² = 6.65e-25 cm². But Thomson scattering is for photons, not electrons. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the cross section for electron-atom scattering. At low energies, the electron's de Broglie wavelength becomes significant. The de Broglie wavelength λ = h/(mv). If the electron's kinetic energy is low, the velocity is low, so λ is large. If λ is comparable to the size of the atom, then the cross section would be on the order of λ². Let's see. For thermal energies, say 0.1 eV. The mass of electron is ~9e-31 kg. Kinetic energy E = 0.1 eV = 0.1 * 1.6e-19 J = 1.6e-20 J. Then velocity v = sqrt(2E/m) = sqrt(2*1.6e-20 / 9e-31) ≈ sqrt(3.2e-20 / 9e-31) ≈ sqrt(3.55e10) ≈ 1.88e5 m/s. Then de Broglie wavelength λ = h/(mv) = 6.626e-34 / (9e-31 kg * 1.88e5 m/s) ≈ 6.626e-34 / (1.69e-25) ≈ 3.92e-9 meters, which is 3.92e-7 cm. Then cross section σ ≈ π(λ/2π)^2 = (λ²)/(4π) ≈ (3.92e-9 m)^2 / (4π) but wait, maybe just λ squared. Wait, cross section for scattering when wavelength is λ is roughly on the order of λ squared. So (3.92e-9 m)^2 = (3.92e-9)^2 m² = 1.5e-17 m². Convert to cm²: 1.5e-17 m² * (1e4 cm²/m²) = 1.5e-13 cm². Wait, that's 1e-13 cm², which is larger than the options given. But the options are 1e-16, 1e-24, etc. Hmm, maybe my energy assumption is wrong. Maybe low-energy electrons here mean even lower energy? Or perhaps the cross section is not purely determined by the wavelength.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering that at low energies, the electron doesn't have enough energy to excite the atom, so the scattering is elastic and the cross section is determined by the atomic size. As I calculated before, the geometric cross section is around 1e-16 cm². So that would match the first option. But wait, I thought the Thomson cross section is 6.6e-25 cm², which is 1e-24 order. But that's for photon-electron scattering. Maybe for electron-atom scattering, the cross section is larger because the atom is a bigger target. An atom has a radius of ~1e-8 cm, so cross section area πr² ≈ 3e-16 cm². So 1e-16 cm² is in the ballpark. So the answer might be 1e-16 cm². But wait, another thought: cross sections for electron interactions can be in the range of 1e-16 to 1e-15 cm² for certain processes. For example, the cross section for ionization might be lower, but elastic scattering could be higher. Wait, but I need to recall typical cross sections. Let me think of some known values. The cross section for Compton scattering is similar to Thomson, around 1e-24 cm². But that's photon-electron. For electron-atom scattering, maybe the cross section is larger. For example, the Rutherford cross section formula is (Z² e^4)/( (4πε₀)^2 (4 E)^2 ) ), but depends on energy. At low energy, the cross section becomes larger. Wait, Rutherford cross section goes as 1/E², so lower energy (E) gives larger cross section. So if E is very low, cross section could be large. But how large?\n\nAlternatively, the cross section for electron scattering by atoms at thermal energies (like in gases) is known. For example, in gas ionization, cross sections can be around 1e-16 cm². But maybe for elastic scattering, it's similar. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me check another approach. The cross section units: barn is 1e-24 cm². So 1 barn is 1e-24 cm². So if the answer is 1e-24 cm², that's 1 barn. But is electron-atom scattering cross section on the order of barns? Wait, nuclear cross sections are in barns (1e-24 cm²), but atomic cross sections are much larger. For example, the cross section for photon absorption in the visible range by atoms is about 1e-16 cm² (that's the order of the cross section for atomic transitions). So maybe for electron scattering, it's similar. Alternatively, if the cross section is similar to the geometric cross section of the atom, which is 1e-16 cm², then that's the answer. But I need to verify.\n\nWait, let's think of the size. An atom is about 1 Ångström in radius, which is 1e-8 cm. The area is π*(1e-8 cm)^2 ≈ 3e-16 cm². So that's 3e-16 cm². So the cross section should be around that. So the first option is 1e-16 cm². That's close. So the answer is 10^-16 cm². But why is 1e-24 cm² (1 barn) an option? Because barn is nuclear cross section. So if the question is about electron-atom scattering, which is atomic scale, the cross section should be much larger than nuclear cross sections. So 1e-16 cm² is plausible. Therefore, the answer is 10^{-16} cm².\n</think>\n\nThe typical cross section for low-energy electron-atom scattering can be estimated by considering the atomic size. An atom has a radius on the order of \\(1 \\, \\text{Å} = 10^{-8} \\, \\text{cm}\\). The geometric cross-sectional area is approximately \\(\\pi r^2 \\approx 3 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{cm}^2\\). This aligns with the first option provided. Nuclear cross sections (in barns, \\(10^{-24} \\, \\text{cm}^2\\)) are much smaller, and other options like \\(10^{-32}\\) or \\(10^{-40} \\, \\text{cm}^2\\) are orders of magnitude too small for atomic-scale interactions. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10^{-16} \\, \\text{cm}^2}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["10^{-16} \\, \\text{cm}^2"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "10^{-16} \\, \\text{cm}^2", "expr2": "10^{-16} \\ \\text{cm}^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-24", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the pressure exerted by an electron confined in a hollow spherical cavity with radius R and impenetrable walls, specifically in its ground state. Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic quantum mechanics concepts. The electron is trapped inside this cavity, so its wavefunction must go to zero at the walls. That means we're dealing with a three-dimensional infinite potential well, but spherical in shape. \n\nFirst, I remember that in such cases, the solutions to the Schrödinger equation are given in terms of spherical coordinates. The wavefunctions for a particle in a spherical cavity are spherical Bessel functions for the radial part and spherical harmonics for the angular part. But since we're looking for the ground state, the angular part should be the simplest, which is the s-orbital. That means the angular quantum number l is zero. So the ground state will have the quantum numbers n=1 and l=0. \n\nThe radial Schrödinger equation for a spherical cavity is something like:\n\n(-ħ²/(2m) * (d²/dr² + (2/r) d/dr) ) ψ(r) = E ψ(r)\n\nBut since l=0, the centrifugal term (which usually has l(l+1)/r²) disappears. So the equation simplifies. The solutions to this equation when the potential is zero inside the sphere and infinite outside are the spherical Bessel functions of the first kind. For l=0, the spherical Bessel function is j₀(kr) = sin(kr)/(kr). \n\nThe boundary condition at r=R is that the wavefunction must be zero. So j₀(kR) = 0. The zeros of j₀ are at kR = nπ, where n is a positive integer. Since it's the ground state, n=1. Therefore, k = π/R. \n\nThe energy levels are given by E = (ħ² k²)/(2m). Plugging in k=π/R, we get E = (ħ² π²)/(2m R²). That's the ground state energy. \n\nBut the question is about pressure. Pressure is force per unit area, but in thermodynamics and quantum mechanics, pressure can also be related to the derivative of energy with respect to volume. For a system where the energy depends on the volume, the pressure is given by P = -dE/dV. \n\nSo if I can find how the energy E depends on the volume V, then taking the negative derivative with respect to V should give the pressure. Let's check that. \n\nFirst, express E in terms of V. The volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)π R³, so R = (3V/(4π))^(1/3). Let's substitute R into the energy expression. \n\nE = (ħ² π²)/(2m R²) = (ħ² π²)/(2m) * (4π/(3V))^(2/3) * (1/R² * R² cancels? Wait, no. Wait, R is expressed in terms of V. Let me do that step carefully. \n\nIf R = (3V/(4π))^(1/3), then R² = (3V/(4π))^(2/3). Therefore, 1/R² = (4π/(3V))^(2/3). \n\nSo substituting back into E:\n\nE = (ħ² π²)/(2m) * (4π/(3V))^(2/3)\n\nSo E is proportional to V^(-2/3). Now, taking the derivative of E with respect to V:\n\ndE/dV = (ħ² π²)/(2m) * (-2/3) * (4π/(3))^(2/3) * V^(-5/3)\n\nBut the pressure is P = -dE/dV. So:\n\nP = (ħ² π²)/(2m) * (2/3) * (4π/(3))^(2/3) * V^(-5/3)\n\nBut maybe it's better to express this in terms of R instead of V. Let's see. Since V = (4/3)π R³, then dV/dR = 4π R². Therefore, dE/dV = (dE/dR) / (dV/dR) = (dE/dR) / (4π R²). \n\nLet me compute dE/dR first. The original E is (ħ² π²)/(2m R²). So dE/dR = - (ħ² π²)/(m R³). Then dE/dV = (-ħ² π²)/(m R³) / (4π R²) ) = (-ħ² π²)/(4π m R^5) ) = (-ħ² π)/(4 m R^5). \n\nTherefore, the pressure P is -dE/dV = ħ² π/(4 m R^5). Wait, but let me check the signs again. \n\nWait, E = (ħ² π²)/(2m R²). So dE/dR = - (ħ² π²)/(m R³). Then dE/dV = dE/dR * dR/dV. Since V = (4/3)π R³, dV/dR = 4π R², so dR/dV = 1/(4π R²). Therefore, dE/dV = (-ħ² π²)/(m R³) * 1/(4π R²) ) = (-ħ² π²)/(4π m R^5) ) = (-ħ² π)/(4 m R^5). \n\nTherefore, pressure P = -dE/dV = ħ² π/(4 m R^5). \n\nWait, but let me check the units. Pressure has units of energy per volume. Let's see: ħ²/(m R^5) multiplied by π/4. Let's check the units. ħ has units of J·s. m is kg. R is meters. So ħ²/(m R^5) has units (J²·s²)/(kg·m^5). But J is kg·m²/s², so substituting:\n\n( (kg²·m^4/s^4) · s² ) / (kg·m^5) ) = (kg·m^4/s²) / (kg·m^5) ) = 1/(m·s²). Hmm, that's not pressure. Pressure is N/m² = kg/(m·s²). So the units here are 1/(m·s²), which is missing a kg. So something's wrong here. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's go back. \n\nOriginal energy E = (ħ² π²)/(2m R²). So units of E: ħ²/(m R²) has units (J²·s²)/(kg·m²). Wait, ħ is J·s. So ħ² is J²·s². Then ħ²/(m R²) is (J² s²)/(kg m²). But J is kg m²/s², so J² is kg² m^4/s^4. Therefore, ħ²/(m R²) is (kg² m^4/s^4 * s²) / (kg m²) ) = (kg m²/s²) = J. So E is in Joules, which is correct. \n\nThen dE/dV should be in J/m³, which is N/m², which is pressure. \n\nBut when I calculated dE/dV, I got (-ħ² π)/(4 m R^5). Let's check the units here. ħ²/(m R^5) has units (J² s²)/(kg m^5). Wait, but J is kg m²/s². So substituting:\n\n( (kg² m^4/s^4) * s² ) / (kg m^5) ) = (kg m^4/s²) / (kg m^5) ) = 1/(m s²). Which is not J/m³. So there's a mistake here. \n\nWait, maybe the error is in the differentiation step. Let's try another approach. \n\nExpressing E in terms of V. Since V = (4/3)π R³, so R = (3V/(4π))^(1/3). Then E = (ħ² π²)/(2m R²) = (ħ² π²)/(2m) * (4π/(3V))^(2/3). \n\nSo E = (ħ² π²)/(2m) * (4π/3)^(2/3) * V^(-2/3). \n\nThen dE/dV = (ħ² π²)/(2m) * (4π/3)^(2/3) * (-2/3) V^(-5/3). \n\nTherefore, P = -dE/dV = (ħ² π²)/(2m) * (4π/3)^(2/3) * (2/3) V^(-5/3). \n\nBut let's express this in terms of R instead. Since V = (4/3)π R³, V^(-5/3) = [(4/3)π R³]^(-5/3) = (4π/3)^(-5/3) R^(-5). \n\nSubstituting back into P:\n\nP = (ħ² π²)/(2m) * (4π/3)^(2/3) * (2/3) * (4π/3)^(-5/3) R^(-5)\n\nSimplify the exponents: (4π/3)^(2/3 -5/3) = (4π/3)^(-1) = 3/(4π). \n\nSo:\n\nP = (ħ² π²)/(2m) * (2/3) * (3/(4π)) * R^(-5)\n\nSimplify coefficients:\n\n(ħ² π²)/(2m) * (2/3) * (3/(4π)) = (ħ² π²)/(2m) * (2/3 * 3/(4π)) ) = (ħ² π²)/(2m) * (1/(2π)) ) = (ħ² π²)/(4 m π) ) = (ħ² π)/(4 m)\n\nSo P = (ħ² π)/(4 m) * R^(-5) = (ħ² π)/(4 m R^5)\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the differentiation via the chain rule, I got the same result: ħ² π/(4 m R^5). But the units still seem off. Let me check again. \n\nħ has units of J·s. m is kg. R is meters. So ħ²/(m R^5) has units (J² s²)/(kg m^5). But J is kg m²/s², so J² is kg² m^4/s^4. Therefore, the units become (kg² m^4/s^4 * s²) / (kg m^5) ) = (kg m^4/s²) / (kg m^5) ) = 1/(m s²). But pressure is N/m² = kg/(m s²). So this is missing a kg. \n\nWait, that suggests there's a mistake in the calculation. Where did I go wrong? Let's check the expression for pressure again. \n\nPressure is P = -dE/dV. Let's compute E in terms of V correctly. \n\nE = (ħ² π²)/(2m R²). But R = (3V/(4π))^(1/3). Therefore, substituting R into E:\n\nE = (ħ² π²)/(2m) * (4π/(3V))^(2/3)\n\nSo E = (ħ² π²)/(2m) * (4π/3)^(2/3) * V^(-2/3)\n\nThen dE/dV = (ħ² π²)/(2m) * (4π/3)^(2/3) * (-2/3) V^(-5/3)\n\nTherefore, P = -dE/dV = (ħ² π²)/(2m) * (4π/3)^(2/3) * (2/3) V^(-5/3)\n\nBut let's express V in terms of R again. Since V = (4/3)π R³, V^(-5/3) = [(4/3)π]^(-5/3) R^(-5). \n\nSubstituting back:\n\nP = (ħ² π²)/(2m) * (4π/3)^(2/3) * (2/3) * [(4π/3)^(-5/3)] R^(-5)\n\nSimplify the exponents for (4π/3):\n\n(4π/3)^(2/3 -5/3) = (4π/3)^(-1) = 3/(4π)\n\nSo:\n\nP = (ħ² π²)/(2m) * (2/3) * (3/(4π)) * R^(-5)\n\nMultiply the constants:\n\n(ħ² π²)/(2m) * (2/3 * 3/(4π)) ) = (ħ² π²)/(2m) * (1/(2π)) ) = (ħ² π²)/(4 m π) ) = (ħ² π)/(4 m)\n\nTherefore, P = (ħ² π)/(4 m R^5)\n\nBut the units still don't match. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the differentiation step. Let's try another approach. Let's use dimensional analysis to see what the correct expression should look like. \n\nPressure has dimensions [Mass/(Length·Time²)]. \n\nThe expression we have is (ħ² π)/(4 m R^5). Let's check the dimensions:\n\nħ has dimensions [Energy·Time] = [Mass·Length²/Time]. So ħ² has [Mass²·Length^4/Time²]. \n\nDivided by m (Mass) and R^5 (Length^5):\n\n[Mass²·Length^4/Time²] / [Mass·Length^5] = [Mass/(Length·Time²)], which matches pressure's dimensions. Okay, so the units are correct. Maybe I was confused earlier, but actually, the units do check out. \n\nSo the final expression for pressure is P = (ħ² π)/(4 m R^5). \n\nBut wait, let me cross-verify with another method. The pressure can also be thought of as the expectation value of the force per unit area. The force is related to the derivative of the potential, but since the walls are impenetrable, the electron exerts a force on the walls due to its kinetic energy. \n\nAlternatively, using the virial theorem. For a particle in a three-dimensional box, the average kinetic energy is related to the pressure. The virial theorem states that for a potential V(r) proportional to r^n, the average kinetic energy is (n/2) times the average potential energy. But in this case, the potential is zero inside and infinite outside, so maybe the virial theorem isn't directly applicable. \n\nAlternatively, think about the energy. The ground state energy is E = (ħ² π²)/(2m R²). If the radius increases by dR, the work done by the pressure is P * 4π R² dR. This should equal the change in energy dE. So dE = P * 4π R² dR. Therefore, P = (dE/dR)/(4π R²). \n\nCompute dE/dR: E = (ħ² π²)/(2m R²), so dE/dR = - (ħ² π²)/(m R³). Then P = (-1/(4π R²)) * (ħ² π²)/(m R³) ) = - (ħ² π²)/(4π m R^5) ) = - (ħ² π)/(4 m R^5). But since pressure is outward, we take the magnitude, so P = ħ² π/(4 m R^5). \n\nYes, this matches the previous result. So the pressure is indeed P = ħ² π/(4 m R^5). \n\nBut wait, let me check standard references. For a particle in a 3D box, the pressure can be derived from the energy. For example, in a cubic box of side L, the ground state energy is E = (3ħ² π²)/(2m L²). The volume is V = L³, so dE/dV = dE/dL * dL/dV. dE/dL = -3ħ² π²/(m L³), dL/dV = 1/(3L²). So dE/dV = -3ħ² π²/(m L³) * 1/(3L²) ) = -ħ² π²/(m L^5). Then pressure P = -dE/dV = ħ² π²/(m L^5). For a cube, the pressure would be different, but here we have a sphere. \n\nIn the spherical case, the energy is E = (ħ² π²)/(2m R²), and following similar steps, we get P = ħ² π/(4 m R^5). \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a factor difference because of the geometry. Let me confirm with another approach. \n\nThe pressure on the wall is the expectation value of the radial force per unit area. The force is the negative gradient of the potential, but since the potential is infinite outside, the force is related to the momentum change upon reflection. However, this might be more complicated. \n\nAlternatively, using the stress tensor, but that might be overkill. \n\nAlternatively, consider that the pressure is the average force per unit area. The force exerted by the electron on the wall is related to the momentum transfer when the electron reflects off the wall. In a classical picture, if the electron is bouncing back and forth, the pressure is related to the momentum change per collision times the collision rate per unit area. \n\nBut quantum mechanically, the electron is in a stationary state, so this picture isn't directly applicable. However, the pressure can still be derived from the energy derivative. \n\nGiven that the two methods (energy derivative and force via momentum transfer) should agree, but in the quantum case, the energy derivative approach is more reliable. \n\nSo, after verifying through differentiation and checking units, the pressure should be P = ħ² π/(4 m R^5). \n\nBut wait, let me check if the ground state energy is correctly calculated. For a spherical cavity, the ground state corresponds to the first zero of the spherical Bessel function. For l=0, the first zero of j₀(x) = sin(x)/x is at x=π. Therefore, kR = π, so k=π/R. Then the energy E = ħ² k²/(2m) = ħ² π²/(2m R²). That's correct. \n\nTherefore, the derivative steps are correct, leading to P = ħ² π/(4 m R^5). \n\nBut let me check if there's a missing factor. For example, in three dimensions, sometimes factors come from integration over angles, but in this case, since we're dealing with radial dependence and the ground state is spherically symmetric, the calculation should be straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pressure is (1/3) of the energy density. The energy density is E/V. Let's see: E/V = (ħ² π²)/(2m R²) / ( (4/3)π R³ ) ) = (3 ħ² π)/(8 m R^5). If pressure is (1/3) of that, then P = ( ħ² π)/(8 m R^5). But this contradicts our previous result. \n\nWait, where does this idea come from? For a photon gas, pressure is 1/3 of the energy density. But for a non-relativistic particle, the pressure is related differently. Actually, the relation P = (2/3) (E/V) holds for a non-relativistic ideal gas in three dimensions. Let's check that. \n\nFor a non-relativistic gas, the average kinetic energy is (3/2) k_B T per particle, and the pressure is P = (2/3) (E/V). If E is the total energy, then P = (2/3)(E/V). \n\nIn our case, the electron is a single particle, so E is the total energy. Let's compute (2/3)(E/V). \n\nE = ħ² π²/(2m R²), V = (4/3)π R³. \n\n(2/3)(E/V) = (2/3) * (ħ² π²/(2m R²)) / ( (4/3)π R³ ) ) = (2/3) * (3 ħ² π)/(8 m R^5) ) = ( ħ² π)/(4 m R^5 )\n\nWhich matches our previous result! So this confirms that P = (2/3)(E/V) = ħ² π/(4 m R^5). \n\nTherefore, both methods agree. \n\nThus, the pressure exerted by the electron on the walls of the spherical cavity in its ground state is P = ħ² π/(4 m R^5). \n\nBut let me check if there's a standard formula for this. I recall that for a particle in a 3D box, the pressure depends on the geometry. For a cube, the pressure on each face is different, but for a sphere, the pressure is uniform. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is using the expectation value of the radial force. The force F is the negative gradient of the potential, but since the potential is a step function, the force is a delta function at the boundary. However, calculating this requires careful handling of the boundary conditions. \n\nAlternatively, using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, which states that the derivative of the energy with respect to a parameter (here, R) is equal to the expectation value of the derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to that parameter. \n\nThe Hamiltonian here depends on R through the boundary conditions. However, the Hellmann-Feynman theorem is usually applied when the Hamiltonian has an explicit dependence on a parameter. In this case, the dependence is implicit through the boundary conditions. But I think the theorem can still be applied by considering the scaling of the system. \n\nIf we scale the radius R by a factor λ, then the new radius is λR. The wavefunction must adjust to satisfy the boundary condition at λR. The scaled wavefunction would be ψ_λ(r) = ψ(r/λ) / λ^(3/2) to maintain normalization. The kinetic energy operator scales as 1/λ², so the energy E(λ) = (1/λ²) E. Then, the derivative of E with respect to λ at λ=1 is dE/dλ = -2 E. But the work done by the pressure when scaling λ is P * dV = P * 4π R² dR. If dλ = dR/R, then dV = 4π R² dR = 4π R³ dλ. Therefore, the work done is P * 4π R³ dλ. Setting this equal to -dE/dλ dλ = 2 E dλ. Therefore, P * 4π R³ = 2 E, so P = 2 E/(4π R³) ) = E/(2π R³). \n\nBut wait, let's compute E/(2π R³). E is ħ² π²/(2m R²). So E/(2π R³) = (ħ² π²)/(2m R²) / (2π R³) ) = (ħ² π)/(4 m R^5). Which matches our previous result. \n\nThis method also gives P = ħ² π/(4 m R^5). \n\nTherefore, all methods converge to the same expression. \n\nThus, the pressure exerted by the electron on the walls of the spherical cavity in its ground state is P = (ħ² π)/(4 m R^5). \n\nBut let me check if there's a missing factor of 2. For example, in the cubic case, the pressure from one face is (ħ² π²)/(m L^5), but for a cube, the energy is E = (3ħ² π²)/(2m L²), so P = -dE/dL * 1/(6 L²) ) since there are 6 faces. Let's compute that. \n\nFor a cube, V = L³, so dV/dL = 3L². The pressure on one face would be P = -dE/dV = -dE/dL * dL/dV = -dE/dL / (3L²). \n\nE = (3ħ² π²)/(2m L²), so dE/dL = -3ħ² π²/(m L³). Then P = - (-3ħ² π²/(m L³)) / (3L²) ) = ħ² π²/(m L^5). Which matches the earlier result. \n\nIn the spherical case, the pressure is uniform, so the derivative is straightforward. \n\nTherefore, after multiple methods and checks, the pressure is indeed P = ħ² π/(4 m R^5). \n\nSo the final answer should be boxed as:\n\n\\boxed{P = \\dfrac{\\hbar^2 \\pi}{4 m R^5}}\n</think>\n\nTo find the pressure exerted by an electron confined in a hollow spherical cavity of radius \\( R \\) in its ground state, we start by determining the ground state energy.

{"id": "atomic/1-47", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the probabilities of the helium ion being in the ground state, 2s state, or 2p state after a tritium atom beta-decays. Let me start by recalling what happens in beta decay. Tritium (H-3) has a nucleus with one proton and two neutrons. When it undergoes beta decay, a neutron turns into a proton, emitting an electron and an antineutrino. So the nucleus becomes helium-3, but wait, the problem says He⁺. Wait, helium-3 has two protons and one neutron, so He⁺ would be a helium ion with a +1 charge, meaning it has two protons and one electron? Wait, no. Wait, original tritium is a neutral atom, so it has one electron. After decay, the nucleus becomes helium-3 (charge +2), but since the atom was neutral before decay, the ion would have charge +1, so He⁺. So the helium ion has a nucleus with two protons and one neutron, and a single electron. So the system is a hydrogen-like ion with charge Z=2. \n\nThe key here is that the tritium atom was in its ground state before decay. The question is about the probability that the helium ion is in a particular state immediately after the decay. Since the decay happens suddenly, the electron's wavefunction doesn't have time to adjust. So the probability is determined by the overlap between the original wavefunction (of tritium's ground state) and the wavefunctions of the helium ion's states. This is similar to the sudden approximation in quantum mechanics, where if a perturbation happens suddenly, the wavefunction remains the same, and the probabilities are given by the inner product of the initial wavefunction with the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.\n\nSo, the initial state is the ground state of tritium, which is a hydrogen-like atom with Z=1 (since tritium is an isotope of hydrogen). The final states are the eigenstates of He⁺, which is a hydrogen-like ion with Z=2. The problem is to compute the overlap integrals between the initial wavefunction (Z=1, n=1, l=0) and the final wavefunctions (Z=2, n=1,2,... l=0,1,... etc.), but since the original state has l=0, the overlap will only be non-zero for final states with l=0 due to orthogonality of spherical harmonics. So for part (c), the 2p state has l=1, so the probability should be zero. For parts (a) and (b), we need to compute the overlap between the initial 1s state of H (Z=1) and the 1s and 2s states of He⁺ (Z=2).\n\nLet me recall the wavefunctions for hydrogen-like atoms. The ground state (1s) wavefunction for hydrogen-like atom with nuclear charge Z is:\n\nψ₁₀₀(r) = (Z/a₀)^(3/2) * (1/√π) * e^(-Zr/a₀)\n\nwhere a₀ is the Bohr radius.\n\nSimilarly, the 2s wavefunction for He⁺ (Z=2) would be:\n\nψ₂₀₀(r) = (2/a₀)^(3/2) * (1/√(8π)) * (1 - (2r)/(2a₀)) e^(-2r/(2a₀)) = (2/a₀)^(3/2) * (1/(2√(2π))) * (1 - r/a₀) e^(-r/a₀)\n\nWait, let me check that. The general form for the hydrogenic 2s orbital is:\n\nψ₂₀₀(r) = (Z/(2a₀))^(3/2) * (2 - Zr/a₀) * e^(-Zr/(2a₀)) / (2√(2π))\n\nSo for Z=2, substituting:\n\nψ₂₀₀(r) = (2/(2a₀))^(3/2) * (2 - (2r)/a₀) * e^(-2r/(2a₀)) / (2√(2π)) = (1/a₀)^(3/2) * (2 - 2r/a₀) * e^(-r/a₀) / (2√(2π)) = (1/a₀)^(3/2) * 2(1 - r/a₀) e^(-r/a₀) / (2√(2π)) = (1/a₀)^(3/2) * (1 - r/a₀) e^(-r/a₀) / √(2π)\n\nSo simplifying, ψ₂₀₀ for He⁺ is (1/(a₀^(3/2) √(2π))) (1 - r/a₀) e^(-r/a₀)\n\nThe initial wavefunction for tritium (Z=1) is:\n\nψ_initial(r) = (1/a₀)^(3/2) (1/√π) e^(-r/a₀)\n\nSo the overlap integral for the ground state (1s of He⁺) is the integral of ψ_initial*(r) ψ_1s_He(r) dr^3.\n\nSimilarly for the 2s state.\n\nLet me compute the inner product for the ground state first.\n\nThe He⁺ 1s wavefunction is:\n\nψ_1s_He(r) = (2/a₀)^(3/2) (1/√π) e^(-2r/a₀)\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n⟨ψ_1s_He | ψ_initial⟩ = ∫ [ (2/a₀)^(3/2) (1/√π) e^(-2r/a₀) ]^* [ (1/a₀)^(3/2) (1/√π) e^(-r/a₀) ] d³r\n\nSince everything is real, we can ignore the complex conjugate. So:\n\n= (2^(3/2)/a₀^3) (1/π) ∫ e^(-2r/a₀) e^(-r/a₀) r² sinθ dr dθ dφ\n\nThe angular parts integrate to 4π, since the wavefunctions are spherically symmetric (s-states). So:\n\n= (2^(3/2)/a₀^3) (1/π) * 4π ∫₀^∞ e^(-3r/a₀) r² dr\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n= (2^(3/2) * 4 / a₀^3) ∫₀^∞ r² e^(-3r/a₀) dr\n\nThe integral ∫₀^∞ r² e^{-α r} dr = 2!/α³ = 2/α³. Here, α = 3/a₀, so the integral is 2/( (3/a₀)^3 ) = 2 a₀³ / 27.\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n= (2^(3/2) * 4 / a₀^3) * (2 a₀³ / 27) ) = (8^(1/2) * 4 * 2) / 27 = (2√2 * 8) / 27? Wait, let me compute step by step.\n\nWait, 2^(3/2) is 2 * sqrt(2), 4 is 4, and 2 a₀³ /27 divided by a₀³ gives 2/27. So:\n\n2^(3/2) * 4 * 2 / 27 = (2*sqrt(2)) * 8 / 27 = 16 sqrt(2) / 27 ≈ 16*1.4142 /27 ≈ 22.627 /27 ≈ 0.838. But wait, probability can't be more than 1. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the constants.\n\nWait, let's redo the calculation carefully.\n\nFirst, the coefficient:\n\n(2/a₀)^(3/2) * (1/a₀)^(3/2) = (2^(3/2)/a₀^(3/2)) * (1/a₀^(3/2)) ) = 2^(3/2)/a₀^3\n\nThen, the 1/√π from each wavefunction: (1/√π)(1/√π) = 1/π\n\nMultiply by 4π from the angular integral: 4π * (1/π) = 4\n\nSo the coefficient is 2^(3/2)/a₀^3 * 4\n\nThen the radial integral is ∫₀^∞ r² e^(-3r/a₀) dr. Let me compute that integral.\n\nLet me set x = r/a₀, so r = a₀ x, dr = a₀ dx. Then the integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^∞ (a₀ x)^2 e^(-3x) a₀ dx = a₀^3 ∫₀^∞ x² e^{-3x} dx\n\nThe integral ∫ x² e^{-kx} dx from 0 to ∞ is 2/k³. So here, k=3, so 2/3³ = 2/27. Therefore, the integral is a₀^3 * 2/27.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCoefficient * integral = (2^(3/2)/a₀^3 * 4) * (a₀^3 * 2/27) ) = 2^(3/2) * 4 * 2 /27 = 2^(3/2) * 8 /27\n\n2^(3/2) is 2*sqrt(2), so 2*sqrt(2)*8 = 16 sqrt(2). So 16 sqrt(2)/27 ≈ 16*1.4142/27 ≈ 22.627/27 ≈ 0.838. So the inner product is approximately 0.838, and the probability is the square of that, which is around 0.7. But wait, that's over 0.5, but probabilities can't exceed 1. Wait, but wait, the inner product here is the amplitude, so squaring it gives the probability. But 0.838 squared is about 0.7, which is okay. But let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the coefficients. Let me re-express the wavefunctions properly.\n\nThe initial wavefunction (Tritium, Z=1, 1s):\n\nψ_initial(r) = (1/a₀)^(3/2) * (1/√π) e^{-r/a₀}\n\nThe final wavefunction (He⁺, Z=2, 1s):\n\nψ_final_1s(r) = (2/a₀)^(3/2) * (1/√π) e^{-2r/a₀}\n\nThe overlap integral is:\n\n∫ ψ_final_1s*(r) ψ_initial(r) d³r\n\n= ∫ [ (2/a₀)^(3/2) (1/√π) e^{-2r/a₀} ] [ (1/a₀)^(3/2) (1/√π) e^{-r/a₀} ] r² sinθ dr dθ dφ\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n= (2^(3/2)/a₀^3) * (1/π) ∫ e^{-3r/a₀} r² dr ∫ sinθ dθ dφ\n\nThe angular integral is 4π, so:\n\n= (2^(3/2)/a₀^3) * (1/π) * 4π ∫₀^∞ e^{-3r/a₀} r² dr\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (2^(3/2) * 4 / a₀^3) ∫₀^∞ r² e^{-3r/a₀} dr\n\nLet me substitute x = 3r/a₀ ⇒ r = (a₀ x)/3, dr = a₀ dx/3\n\nThen the integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^∞ ( (a₀ x)/3 )² e^{-x} (a₀ dx/3 )\n\n= (a₀³ / 3³) ∫₀^∞ x² e^{-x} dx\n\n= (a₀³ / 27) * Γ(3) = (a₀³ /27) * 2! = (a₀³ /27)*2 = 2 a₀³ /27\n\nSo substituting back into the expression:\n\n= (2^(3/2) *4 / a₀^3) * (2 a₀³ /27 )\n\n= (2^(3/2) * 4 * 2 ) /27\n\n= (2^(3/2) *8 ) /27\n\n= (8 * 2^(1/2)) /27\n\n= 8√2 /27 ≈ 8*1.4142/27 ≈ 11.3136/27 ≈ 0.419\n\nSo the amplitude is approximately 0.419, so the probability is (0.419)^2 ≈ 0.175. Wait, but 8√2 /27 is approximately 11.3136/27 ≈ 0.419, so the square is ≈ 0.175. Hmm, that's different from my previous calculation. So the probability is (8√2/27)^2 = (64*2)/729 = 128/729 ≈ 0.1756. So approximately 17.56% probability for part (a).\n\nWait, but let me check again. The integral of the product of the two wavefunctions gives the amplitude. The wavefunctions are:\n\nψ_initial(r) = (1/(a₀^{3/2} √π)) e^{-r/a₀}\n\nψ_final_1s(r) = (2^{3/2}/(a₀^{3/2} √π)) e^{-2r/a₀}\n\nSo their product is (2^{3/2}/(a₀^3 π)) e^{-3r/a₀}\n\nIntegrate over all space:\n\n∫ (2^{3/2}/(a₀^3 π)) e^{-3r/a₀} r² sinθ dr dθ dφ\n\nAngular part: 4π\n\nRadial integral: ∫₀^∞ r² e^{-3r/a₀} dr = (a₀/3)^3 Γ(3) = (a₀³/27) * 2! = 2 a₀³ /27\n\nSo total integral:\n\n2^{3/2}/(a₀^3 π) * 4π * 2 a₀³ /27 = 2^{3/2} *4 *2 /27 = 2^{3/2} *8 /27 = 8*2^{1/2}/27 = 8√2 /27 ≈ 11.3137/27 ≈ 0.419\n\nSo the amplitude is 8√2 /27, so the probability is (8√2 /27)^2 = (64*2)/729 = 128/729 ≈ 0.1756, so about 17.56%.\n\nNow for part (b), the 2s state. The 2s wavefunction for He⁺ (Z=2) is:\n\nψ_2s_He(r) = (2/(2a₀))^{3/2} (1/√(4π)) (1 - (2r)/(2a₀)) e^{-2r/(2a₀)} = (1/a₀)^{3/2} (1/√(4π)) (1 - r/a₀) e^{-r/a₀}\n\nWait, let me check the 2s wavefunction again. The general form for the 2s orbital is:\n\nψ_{2s}(r) = (Z/(2a₀))^{3/2} (2 - Zr/a₀) e^{-Zr/(2a₀)} / (2√π)\n\nSo for Z=2:\n\nψ_{2s}(r) = (2/(2a₀))^{3/2} (2 - (2r)/a₀) e^{-2r/(2a₀)} / (2√π) = (1/a₀)^{3/2} (2 - 2r/a₀) e^{-r/a₀} / (2√π) = (1/a₀)^{3/2} (1 - r/a₀) e^{-r/a₀} / √π\n\nSo ψ_2s_He(r) = (1/(a₀^{3/2} √π)) (1 - r/a₀) e^{-r/a₀}\n\nNow, compute the overlap with the initial wavefunction ψ_initial(r) = (1/(a₀^{3/2} √π)) e^{-r/a₀}\n\nSo the inner product is:\n\n⟨ψ_2s_He | ψ_initial⟩ = ∫ [ (1/(a₀^{3/2} √π))(1 - r/a₀) e^{-r/a₀} ] [ (1/(a₀^{3/2} √π)) e^{-r/a₀} ] d³r\n\nSimplify the product:\n\n= (1/(a₀^3 π)) ∫ (1 - r/a₀) e^{-2r/a₀} r² sinθ dr dθ dφ\n\nAgain, angular integral is 4π:\n\n= (1/(a₀^3 π)) *4π ∫₀^∞ (1 - r/a₀) e^{-2r/a₀} r² dr\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n= (4 / a₀^3) ∫₀^∞ (r² - r³/a₀) e^{-2r/a₀} dr\n\nLet me compute this integral. Let me substitute x = 2r/a₀ ⇒ r = (a₀ x)/2, dr = (a₀ dx)/2\n\nThen:\n\nr² = (a₀² x²)/4\n\nr³ = (a₀³ x³)/8\n\ndr = (a₀/2) dx\n\nSo the integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^∞ [ (a₀² x²/4) - (a₀³ x³/8)/a₀ ] e^{-x} (a₀/2) dx\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (a₀² x²/4) * (a₀/2) = a₀³ x² /8\n\nSecond term: (a₀³ x³/8)/a₀ = a₀² x³ /8, multiplied by (a₀/2) gives a₀³ x³ /16\n\nSo the integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^∞ [ (a₀³ x² /8) - (a₀³ x³ /16) ] e^{-x} dx = a₀³/8 ∫ x² e^{-x} dx - a₀³/16 ∫ x³ e^{-x} dx\n\nCompute the integrals:\n\n∫ x² e^{-x} dx = Γ(3) = 2! = 2\n\n∫ x³ e^{-x} dx = Γ(4) = 3! = 6\n\nSo:\n\n= a₀³/8 * 2 - a₀³/16 *6 = a₀³/4 - (6 a₀³)/16 = a₀³/4 - (3 a₀³)/8 = (2 a₀³ - 3 a₀³)/8 = (-a₀³)/8\n\nWait, that can't be right. The integral of (r² - r³/a₀) e^{-2r/a₀} dr from 0 to ∞ is negative? But the integrand isn't necessarily positive. Let me check the substitution again.\n\nWait, when I substituted x = 2r/a₀, then e^{-2r/a₀} = e^{-x}\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^∞ [ (a₀² x²/4) - (a₀³ x³/8)/a₀ ] e^{-x} (a₀/2) dx\n\nWait, the second term inside the brackets is (r³/a₀) = ( (a₀ x/2)^3 ) /a₀ = (a₀³ x³)/(8 a₀) ) = a₀² x³ /8\n\nSo the integrand is (a₀² x²/4 - a₀² x³/8) * e^{-x} * (a₀/2) dx\n\n= (a₀²/4 x² - a₀²/8 x³) * (a₀/2) e^{-x} dx\n\n= a₀³/8 x² e^{-x} - a₀³/16 x³ e^{-x} dx\n\nThen integrating term by term:\n\nFirst term: a₀³/8 ∫ x² e^{-x} dx = a₀³/8 * 2 = a₀³/4\n\nSecond term: -a₀³/16 ∫ x³ e^{-x} dx = -a₀³/16 *6 = -3 a₀³/8\n\nSo total integral: a₀³/4 - 3a₀³/8 = (2a₀³ -3a₀³)/8 = (-a₀³)/8\n\nBut this is negative, which when multiplied by 4/a₀³ gives -4/a₀³ * (a₀³/8) = -4/8 = -0.5. But the inner product squared can't be negative. Wait, this suggests a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, but the integral ∫₀^∞ (r² - r³/a₀) e^{-2r/a₀} dr = (-a₀³)/8. But how can this be negative? Let me check with specific values. Let's take a₀=1 for simplicity.\n\nThen the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ (r² - r³) e^{-2r} dr. Let's compute this numerically.\n\nCompute ∫ r² e^{-2r} dr from 0 to ∞: Γ(3)/(2^3) = 2/8 = 0.25\n\nCompute ∫ r³ e^{-2r} dr from 0 to ∞: Γ(4)/(2^4) = 6/16 = 0.375\n\nSo the integral is 0.25 - 0.375 = -0.125. So yes, it's negative. But when we multiply by 4/a₀³ (with a₀=1), we get 4*(-0.125) = -0.5. So the inner product is -0.5. But the inner product is a probability amplitude, so it can be negative. The probability is the square, so 0.25. But wait, this is with a₀=1. But in general, the result is:\n\n⟨ψ_2s_He | ψ_initial⟩ = (4/a₀^3) * (-a₀³/8) = -4/8 = -0.5\n\nSo the amplitude is -0.5, so the probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, or 25%.\n\nBut wait, this seems too high. The total probability for 1s and 2s would be 0.1756 + 0.25 = 0.4256, which is less than 1, so there's probability in other states. But let's confirm.\n\nWait, but according to this calculation, the amplitude for 2s is -0.5, so probability 0.25. But let's check the normalization.\n\nWait, the initial wavefunction is the ground state of tritium (Z=1), and the final states are the eigenstates of He⁺ (Z=2). The total probability should be the sum over all final states of |⟨n l m | ψ_initial⟩|². Since the initial state has l=0, only final states with l=0 (s states) will contribute. So the probabilities for all s states (1s, 2s, 3s, etc.) should sum up to 1. But according to our calculation, 1s is ~0.175 and 2s is 0.25, which is already 0.425, so there must be higher states contributing. But maybe the calculation is correct.\n\nBut let's verify the integral again. For the 2s state:\n\nψ_2s_He(r) = (1/(a₀^{3/2} √π))(1 - r/a₀) e^{-r/a₀}\n\nψ_initial(r) = (1/(a₀^{3/2} √π)) e^{-r/a₀}\n\nTheir product is (1/(a₀^3 π))(1 - r/a₀) e^{-2r/a₀}\n\nIntegrate over all space:\n\n∫ (1/(a₀^3 π))(1 - r/a₀) e^{-2r/a₀} r² sinθ dr dθ dφ\n\nAngular integral gives 4π, so:\n\n(4π/(a₀^3 π)) ∫₀^∞ (1 - r/a₀) r² e^{-2r/a₀} dr = (4/a₀^3) ∫₀^∞ (r² - r³/a₀) e^{-2r/a₀} dr\n\nAs before, substitution x = 2r/a₀, r = a₀ x/2, dr = a₀ dx/2\n\nThen:\n\nr² = (a₀² x²)/4\n\nr³ = (a₀³ x³)/8\n\nSo the integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^∞ [ (a₀² x²/4) - (a₀³ x³/8)/a₀ ] e^{-x} (a₀/2) dx = ∫₀^∞ [ (a₀² x²/4 - a₀² x³/8) ] e^{-x} (a₀/2) dx\n\n= (a₀³/8) ∫ x² e^{-x} dx - (a₀³/16) ∫ x³ e^{-x} dx\n\n= (a₀³/8)(2) - (a₀³/16)(6) = (a₀³/4) - (3a₀³/8) = -a₀³/8\n\nSo the integral is -a₀³/8, multiplied by 4/a₀³ gives -4/8 = -0.5. So the amplitude is -0.5, probability 0.25. So part (b) is 25%.\n\nBut wait, this seems counterintuitive. The 2s state has a node, so maybe the overlap is negative, but the probability is positive. So the probability for 2s is 25%, and for 1s is ~17.56%, so total ~42.5%, which leaves the rest to higher s states. That seems possible.\n\nFor part (c), the 2p state has l=1, but the initial wavefunction has l=0, so the overlap integral will involve the integral of Y₁₀ (or any m) times Y₀₀, which is zero due to orthogonality of spherical harmonics. Therefore, the probability for 2p is zero.\n\nSo the answers are:\n\n(a) 128/729 ≈ 0.1756 or 128/729\n\n(b) 1/4 or 0.25\n\n(c) 0\n\nBut let me check the exact value for part (a). Earlier, we found the amplitude is 8√2 /27, so the probability is (8√2)^2 /27² = 64*2 /729 = 128/729 ≈ 0.1756.\n\nFor part (b), the amplitude is -1/2, so probability is 1/4.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the probabilities are:\n\n(a) 128/729\n\n(b) 1/4\n\n(c) 0\n\nSo the final answers are:\n\n(a) 128/729\n\n(b) 1/4\n\n(c) 0\n</think>\n\n(a) The probability that the helium ion is in its ground state is determined by the square of the overlap integral between the initial tritium 1s wavefunction (Z=1) and the helium ion 1s wavefunction (Z=2). After calculating the integral, the probability is found to be:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{128}{729}}\n\\]\n\n(b) For the 2s state, the overlap integral between the initial wavefunction and the helium ion 2s wavefunction results in an amplitude of \\(-\\dfrac{1}{2}\\).

{"id": "atomic/1-40", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the first-order radiation decay for this hydrogen atom state that has a small p-wave admixture. The given state is a mix of s-wave and p-wave with a small epsilon parameter. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts about atomic transitions and selection rules.\n\nHydrogen atom transitions are governed by selection rules, which determine which transitions are allowed or forbidden based on changes in quantum numbers. The usual electric dipole (E1) selection rules are Δl = ±1, Δj = 0, ±1 (but j=0 to j=0 is forbidden), and Δm_j depends on the polarization of the photon. But here, the state is a mixture of l=0 and l=1. So when this state decays, what kind of radiation would be emitted?\n\nThe question mentions first-order radiation decay. First-order usually refers to electric dipole (E1) transitions. But maybe higher multipole transitions like magnetic dipole (M1) or electric quadrupole (E2) could be considered if E1 is forbidden. But since the problem states it's a parity-violating force causing the p-wave admixture, perhaps the parity considerations come into play.\n\nWait, parity of the state. The s-wave (l=0) has parity (-1)^0 = +1. The p-wave (l=1) has parity (-1)^1 = -1. So the total state is a mixture of even and odd parity. But parity is violated here, which allows such a mixture. Normally, parity is a good quantum number, so states with different l wouldn't mix. But here, due to parity-violating forces (like the weak interaction?), they can mix.\n\nIn electric dipole transitions, the dipole operator has parity -1 (since it's a vector operator, like r). So the matrix element ⟨f| r |i⟩ must have the product of parities of initial and final states multiplied by the parity of the operator equal to +1. Wait, parity considerations: the operator has parity -1 (since r → -r under parity). So the matrix element ⟨f| r |i⟩ is non-zero only if the initial and final states have parities P_i and P_f such that P_i * P_f * (-1) = +1. So P_i * P_f = -1. Therefore, the initial and final states must have opposite parity.\n\nIn the given state, the initial state is a mixture of l=0 (parity +1) and l=1 (parity -1). So the parity of the initial state isn't well-defined, but since it's a small admixture, maybe we can consider each component separately.\n\nBut the decay would be from the n=2, j=1/2 state to a lower state. The possible lower states in hydrogen are n=1, which for hydrogen has l=0 (since n=1, l=0). So the final state would be the 1S_{1/2} state, which is l=0, j=1/2.\n\nWait, but the initial state is a mixture of l=0 and l=1. Let's break down the possible transitions from each component.\n\nFirst, the s-wave part: Ψ_s(n=2, j=1/2, l=0). If this were the entire initial state, then transitioning to the 1S_{1/2} state (n=1, l=0) would require Δl = 0, which is forbidden by the E1 selection rules (Δl must be ±1). So the s-wave part can't decay via E1 to the 1S state. Then, how does hydrogen normally decay from n=2 to n=1? Wait, the 2S state (l=0) is metastable because the transition to 1S (l=0) is forbidden by E1. Normally, the 2P state (l=1) can decay to 1S via E1. But in this problem, the initial state is a mixture of 2S and 2P. So the p-wave component (l=1) can decay via E1 to 1S (l=0), since Δl = -1, which is allowed.\n\nTherefore, the presence of the small εΨ_p term allows the state to decay via E1 transition. So the first-order radiation decay would be electric dipole (E1) transition from the p-wave component of the initial state to the 1S state.\n\nBut the initial state is a combination of s and p. So the matrix element would involve the overlap between the initial state (which has both s and p) and the final state (which is s). But since the final state is l=0, the matrix element would be ⟨1S | r | 2P⟩, multiplied by ε, because the p-component is εΨ_p. The s-component would contribute ⟨1S | r | 2S⟩, but that matrix element is zero because Δl=0, which is forbidden for E1. So the dominant term comes from the p-component.\n\nTherefore, the decay matrix element is proportional to ε times the usual E1 matrix element between 2P and 1S. So the form of the decay matrix element is ε multiplied by the dipole matrix element ⟨1S | e r | 2P⟩.\n\nIf ε → 0, then the matrix element goes to zero. That's because without the p-wave admixture, the initial state is pure s-wave (l=0), and the transition to 1S (l=0) is forbidden by the E1 selection rules. Hence, the decay would not happen in first order; it would require higher-order processes like two-photon emission, which is much slower. But in the problem, when ε is non-zero, the small p-wave component allows the E1 transition to proceed, making the decay possible in first order.\n\nSo putting it all together: the first-order decay is E1 transition due to the p-wave admixture. The matrix element is ε times the usual E1 matrix element between 2P and 1S.

{"id": "atomic/1-49", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The question asks to derive an expression for the energy levels of the He+ ion using the Bohr model. Alright, so He+ is a hydrogen-like ion, meaning it has only one electron orbiting a nucleus with charge Z. For helium, the atomic number Z is 2. \n\nIn the Bohr model, the energy levels for hydrogen-like atoms are given by the formula E_n = - (Z² * R_H) / n², where R_H is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen. But wait, I need to remember that the Rydberg constant itself depends on the reduced mass of the electron and the nucleus. However, in many derivations, especially for heavier nuclei, the reduced mass is approximated by the electron mass because the nucleus is much more massive. But since He+ has a nucleus with mass 4 times that of hydrogen (since helium has a mass number of 4), maybe the reduced mass correction is more significant here? Hmm, but the problem says to use the Bohr model, which typically uses the Rydberg constant adjusted for the nuclear charge. Let me recall the standard Bohr model formula.\n\nThe standard energy levels for a hydrogen-like atom are E_n = - (Z² * k_e² * e^4 * m_e) / (2ħ²) * 1/n². Alternatively, this can be written as E_n = - (Z² * R_H) / n², where R_H is approximately 13.6 eV. But wait, R_H is actually derived considering the reduced mass of the electron and proton. For a nucleus with mass M, the Rydberg constant becomes R_H * (m_e / (1 + m_e/M)). However, in the case of He+, the nucleus is much heavier than the proton (since it's a He nucleus, which is about 4 times the mass of a proton). But maybe the problem assumes that the Rydberg constant is taken as the same as hydrogen but scaled by Z², neglecting the reduced mass difference. Let me check.\n\nIn the original Bohr model for hydrogen, the energy levels are E_n = -13.6 eV / n². For He+ (Z=2), the energy would be E_n = -13.6 * Z² / n² = -13.6 * 4 / n² = -54.4 / n² eV. But if we consider the reduced mass correction, the Rydberg constant for He+ would be R_He = R_H * (m_e / (1 + m_e/M_He)), where M_He is the mass of the He nucleus. Since M_He is about 4 * m_p (proton mass), and m_e / m_p is approximately 1/1836, so m_e / M_He ≈ 1/(4*1836) ≈ 1/7344. So the correction factor (m_e / (1 + m_e/M_He)) ≈ m_e / (1 + 1/7344) ≈ m_e * (1 - 1/7344), which is very close to m_e. Therefore, the Rydberg constant for He+ would be approximately R_H * (M_He / (M_He + m_e)) ≈ R_H * [1 / (1 + m_e/M_He)] ≈ R_H * (1 - m_e/M_He). But since m_e/M_He is so small, this correction is negligible compared to the Z² term. Therefore, the problem probably expects us to ignore the reduced mass effect and just use E_n = -13.6 * Z² / n² eV. So for He+, Z=2, so E_n = -54.4 eV / n². Therefore, the expression is E_n = -54.4 eV / n². But let's derive it properly.\n\nStarting from the Bohr model postulates. The centripetal force is provided by the Coulomb force: (m_e v²)/r = (k_e * Z e²)/r². Solving for v²: v² = (k_e Z e²)/(m_e r). The angular momentum is quantized: m_e v r = nħ. So substituting v from the previous equation: m_e * sqrt((k_e Z e²)/(m_e r)) * r = nħ. Simplify sqrt((k_e Z e² r)/m_e) * r = nħ. Wait, let me square both sides to make it easier. Let me re-express the angular momentum equation: m_e v r = nħ. From the Coulomb force equation: v² = (k_e Z e²)/(m_e r). So v = sqrt( (k_e Z e²)/(m_e r) ). Substitute into angular momentum equation: m_e * sqrt( (k_e Z e²)/(m_e r) ) * r = nħ. Simplify inside the square root: (k_e Z e²)/(m_e r). Multiply by m_e and r: sqrt( k_e Z e² m_e r / m_e r ) * m_e r = nħ? Wait, maybe better to square both sides. Let's square both sides of the angular momentum equation: (m_e v r)^2 = n² ħ². Substitute v² from the Coulomb equation: m_e² * (k_e Z e²)/(m_e r) * r² = n² ħ². Simplify: m_e * k_e Z e² * r = n² ħ². Solving for r: r = (n² ħ²)/(m_e k_e Z e²). So the radius for the nth orbit is r_n = (n² ħ²)/(m_e k_e Z e²). For hydrogen (Z=1), this is the Bohr radius a_0 = ħ²/(m_e k_e e²). So for He+, r_n = (n² / Z) a_0. So r_n = n²/(2) a_0.\n\nNow, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. The kinetic energy K = (1/2) m_e v². The potential energy U = -k_e Z e² / r. From the Coulomb force equation, m_e v² / r = k_e Z e² / r² => v² = (k_e Z e²)/(m_e r). So K = (1/2) m_e * (k_e Z e²)/(m_e r) ) = (k_e Z e²)/(2 r). The potential energy U = -k_e Z e² / r. So total energy E = K + U = (k_e Z e²)/(2 r) - (k_e Z e²)/r = - (k_e Z e²)/(2 r). Substitute r from above: r_n = (n² ħ²)/(m_e k_e Z e²). So E_n = - (k_e Z e²)/(2 * (n² ħ²)/(m_e k_e Z e²)) ) = - (k_e² Z² e^4 m_e )/(2 ħ² n² ). \n\nAlternatively, this can be written in terms of the Rydberg constant. The Rydberg constant R_H is given by (m_e e^4)/(8 ε_0² h²) or in terms of k_e = 1/(4πε_0), so substituting, R_H = (m_e e^4)/(8 (1/(4π ε_0))^2 h²) )? Wait, maybe better to recall that E_n = -13.6 eV * Z² / n². Since for hydrogen Z=1, E_n = -13.6 eV / n². For He+, Z=2, so E_n = -13.6 * 4 / n² = -54.4 / n² eV. Therefore, the expression is E_n = -54.4 eV / n². But let's make sure the derivation is correct. The key steps are the quantization of angular momentum and the Coulomb force providing centripetal acceleration. The energy expression comes out as E_n = - (Z² R_H) / n², where R_H is 13.6 eV. So yes, part (a) answer is E_n = -54.4 eV / n², or more generally E_n = - (Z² * 13.6 eV) / n². Since Z=2 for He+, that's -54.4 eV / n².\n\nNow part (b): calculate the energies of the l = 1 state in a magnetic field, neglecting electron spin. Wait, the problem says \"l = 1 state\". But in the Bohr model, the angular momentum is quantized as nħ, where n is the principal quantum number. However, in the Bohr model, the orbital angular momentum is nħ, but in reality (according to the more accurate quantum mechanics), the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can be from 0 to n-1. But the Bohr model doesn't account for different l values; it assumes circular orbits with angular momentum nħ. So there's a discrepancy here. The problem mentions \"l = 1 state\", which is a quantum mechanical concept. But the question is using the Bohr model. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the problem is mixing the Bohr model with some quantum numbers. Wait, the Bohr model does have the principal quantum number n, which in the old quantum theory corresponds to the angular momentum being nħ, but in modern terms, the angular momentum quantum number l is up to n-1. However, in the Bohr model, all orbits are circular and have angular momentum nħ, which would correspond to l = n-1 in the modern sense. Wait, no. For example, in the Bohr model, n=1 has angular momentum ħ, which in modern terms would correspond to l=0 (since l=0 has angular momentum sqrt(l(l+1))ħ ≈ 0). Wait, no, there's a conflict here. The Bohr model assigns angular momentum nħ, but in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum is sqrt(l(l+1))ħ, and for each n, l can be from 0 to n-1. So there's a mismatch. Therefore, perhaps the problem is using the Bohr model but referring to the quantum number l as in quantum mechanics. But how to reconcile this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to use the Bohr model for part (a), and for part (b), even though it's in the context of the Bohr model, to use the quantum mechanical treatment of the Zeeman effect but neglecting spin. Wait, but the question says \"using the Bohr model of the atom\" for part (a), but part (b) is a separate question. Wait, the problem is structured as (a) and (b), both under \"using the Bohr model\". Hmm, but the Bohr model doesn't have a concept of l as in quantum mechanics. So perhaps there's a mistake here, or maybe the problem is expecting us to use the Bohr model's angular momentum (which is nħ) and then consider the magnetic interaction energy due to the orbital angular momentum. But the problem mentions \"l = 1\", which is a quantum number from quantum mechanics. Maybe the problem is actually expecting a transition to quantum numbers despite the Bohr model. Alternatively, perhaps \"l = 1\" is a typo and should be \"n = 1\", but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe in the context of the problem, \"l\" refers to the angular momentum quantum number in the Bohr model, which would be l = n - 1? Wait, no. In the Bohr model, the angular momentum is quantized as L = nħ, where n is an integer starting from 1. In quantum mechanics, L = sqrt(l(l+1))ħ, where l = 0, 1, ..., n-1. So if the problem is referring to l=1 in the quantum mechanical sense, but using the Bohr model, there's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting us to use the quantum mechanical treatment for part (b), even though part (a) is based on the Bohr model. But the problem statement says \"using the Bohr model of the atom\" for both parts. Hmm. This is confusing. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe problem says: (b) calculate the energies of the l = 1 state in a magnetic field, neglecting the electron spin. So \"l = 1\" is given. But in the Bohr model, the angular momentum is nħ, so if we have l = 1 in quantum mechanics, that would correspond to L = sqrt(1(1+1))ħ = sqrt(2)ħ. But in the Bohr model, L = nħ. So there's no direct correspondence. Therefore, perhaps the problem is combining the Bohr model with quantum mechanical angular momentum quantum numbers. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the Bohr model but considering the orbital angular momentum as lħ instead of nħ. That would be inconsistent with the Bohr model. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to use the Bohr model for part (a) and then switch to quantum mechanics for part (b), but the question says \"using the Bohr model of the atom\" for both parts. Hmm. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think.\n\nIn the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels split due to the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman effect can be calculated using the orbital angular momentum. The energy shift is given by ΔE = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment due to orbital angular momentum is μ = - (e/(2m_e)) L. So ΔE = -μ·B = (e/(2m_e)) L·B. If the magnetic field is in the z-direction, then L·B = L_z B. In quantum mechanics, L_z = m_l ħ, where m_l ranges from -l to +l. However, in the Bohr model, the angular momentum is quantized as L = nħ, and the direction might be considered fixed (since orbits are planar), so perhaps in the Bohr model, the orbital angular momentum is along the z-axis with magnitude nħ. But if we have l = 1, which in quantum mechanics corresponds to L = sqrt(2)ħ, but in Bohr model, L = nħ. So if the problem refers to l=1, maybe they are using n=2 (since for Bohr model, n=2 would have L=2ħ, but in QM l=1 would have L=sqrt(2)ħ). This is conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using l as the Bohr model's angular momentum quantum number, which is n. But that's not standard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to use the Bohr model's energy levels from part (a), and then for part (b), consider the Zeeman effect using the orbital angular momentum. But the problem states \"neglecting electron spin\", so it's the normal Zeeman effect. The energy shift due to the magnetic field is ΔE = μ_B * B * m_l, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_l is the magnetic quantum number. However, in the Bohr model, the angular momentum is quantized as L = nħ, and if the magnetic field is applied, the quantization axis is along B, so L_z can take values from -nħ to +nħ in steps of ħ? Wait, no. In the Bohr model, the angular momentum is in a specific plane, so if a magnetic field is applied, the orbit would precess around the field direction, and the component of angular momentum along B would be quantized. But the Bohr model doesn't account for spatial quantization beyond the principal quantum number. However, historically, the Sommerfeld model extended the Bohr model to include elliptical orbits and azimuthal quantum numbers, which might correspond to l. But the problem mentions the Bohr model, not the Sommerfeld extension. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to proceed. The problem says to use the Bohr model. In the Bohr model, the angular momentum is L = nħ. If we have a state with l=1 (which in QM would correspond to L=√2ħ), but in Bohr model, L = nħ. So perhaps the problem is using l as the angular momentum quantum number in the Bohr model, which would mean l = n. But that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo and meant n=1. But the user wrote \"l = 1\". Alternatively, perhaps in the context of the problem, \"l = 1\" refers to the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and we are to calculate the Zeeman splitting for that state, assuming the Bohr model. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to use the Bohr model's energy levels from part (a), and then for part (b), compute the Zeeman effect using the orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1, but in the Bohr model, the angular momentum is nħ. So if l=1, then n=1? Because in the Bohr model, n is the principal quantum number, and angular momentum is nħ. But in QM, l can be up to n-1. So if l=1, then n must be at least 2. But the problem says \"l=1 state\", so perhaps we need to consider that in the Bohr model, even though it doesn't have different l values, but the problem is mixing concepts. This is confusing. Maybe the problem is expecting us to proceed with the quantum mechanical approach despite mentioning the Bohr model. Let's assume that. \n\nIn the normal Zeeman effect (neglecting spin), the energy shift is given by ΔE = μ_B * B * m_l, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton (eħ/(2m_e)), and m_l is the magnetic quantum number ranging from -l to +l in integer steps. For l=1, m_l can be -1, 0, +1. Therefore, the energy levels split into three levels with shifts -μ_B B, 0, +μ_B B. However, the total energy would be the energy from part (a) plus this shift. But part (a) is for He+, so we need to adjust the Bohr magneton for He+? Wait, no. The Bohr magneton is a constant, μ_B = eħ/(2m_e), which is independent of the nucleus. However, the energy levels from part (a) are for He+, but the Zeeman effect here is due to the electron's orbital angular momentum, which is the same as in hydrogen, except that the energy levels are scaled by Z². Wait, no. The magnetic moment depends on the electron's angular momentum. So even in He+, the magnetic moment is μ = - (e/(2m_e)) L. Therefore, the energy shift ΔE = -μ·B = (e/(2m_e)) L·B. If the magnetic field is in the z-direction, then ΔE = (e/(2m_e)) L_z B. In quantum mechanics, L_z = m_l ħ, so ΔE = (eħ/(2m_e)) B m_l = μ_B B m_l. Therefore, the energy levels split into m_l = -1, 0, +1, with shifts -μ_B B, 0, +μ_B B. \n\nBut the problem says \"calculate the energies of the l = 1 state in a magnetic field\". So the total energy would be the energy from part (a) plus the Zeeman shift. However, part (a) is for He+, so the energy levels are E_n = -54.4 eV / n². But the problem mentions \"l = 1 state\", which in quantum mechanics corresponds to a specific n (since l < n). For example, if l=1, then n ≥ 2. But the problem doesn't specify n. Wait, the problem says \"the l = 1 state\", but doesn't specify n. This is a problem. Maybe we are to consider that for any n where l=1, but in the Bohr model, l isn't a separate quantum number. Therefore, perhaps the problem has an error, or perhaps we need to assume that n=2 (since l=1 would correspond to n=2 in quantum mechanics). But this is speculative. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the energy levels of the state with orbital angular momentum l=1 (regardless of n), but in the Bohr model, l is not a separate quantum number. Therefore, this part of the question is inconsistent with the Bohr model. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to use the Bohr model's energy for a state with angular momentum l=1, but since in the Bohr model, angular momentum is nħ, l=1 would correspond to n=1. But in quantum mechanics, l=0 for n=1. This is conflicting. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1 in the quantum mechanical sense, and wants us to calculate the Zeeman splitting for that state, using the Bohr model's energy as the base energy. But how? Let's proceed with the assumption that despite the Bohr model not having l quantum numbers, the problem wants us to use the quantum mechanical value of l=1 and compute the Zeeman effect for that state, using the Bohr model's energy expression from part (a). However, we need to know the principal quantum number n. Since l=1, n must be at least 2. But the problem doesn't specify n. Therefore, this is impossible unless the problem assumes a specific n. Wait, maybe the problem is referring to the state with l=1 in the ground state? But in the ground state of hydrogen-like atoms, n=1 and l=0. So that's not possible. Therefore, the problem must have a missing piece of information. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the energy levels in terms of l and the magnetic quantum number m, but without specifying n. This is unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the energy of the l=1 state (which in the Bohr model would correspond to n=2, since n=2 has angular momentum 2ħ, but in QM l=1 is part of n=2). But this is speculative. Let's assume that for part (b), we are to consider a state with l=1 (from quantum mechanics) and calculate its energy in a magnetic field, using the Bohr model's energy expression. But how? The Bohr model's energy depends only on n, not on l. So if we have l=1, we need to know n. For example, if l=1, then n could be 2, 3, etc. But the problem doesn't specify. Therefore, there's insufficient information. However, perhaps the problem is expecting us to express the answer in terms of n, or maybe it's a follow-up from part (a) where the energy levels are derived, and part (b) is for a general l=1 state, but since the Bohr model doesn't use l, this is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps part (b) is independent of part (a), and just asks to calculate the energies of an l=1 state in a magnetic field, using the Bohr model. But the Bohr model doesn't have l. This is a contradiction. Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the problem statement. However, given that the problem is from an exam or homework, perhaps the intended approach is to use the normal Zeeman effect formula for a state with orbital angular momentum l=1, leading to three energy levels shifted by μ_B B m_l, and the base energy from part (a) for some n. But since part (a) is about He+, the base energy would be E_n = -54.4 eV / n². However, without knowing n, we can't give a numerical answer. Wait, but the problem says \"calculate the energies\", which implies numerical values. Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes that the l=1 state corresponds to the n=2 state in the Bohr model. Because in the Bohr model, n=2 would have angular momentum 2ħ, which in quantum mechanics would correspond to l=1 (since l=1 has angular momentum sqrt(2)ħ ≈ 1.414ħ, but this is not matching). Wait, no. In the Bohr model, angular momentum is quantized as L = nħ. In quantum mechanics, for l=1, L = sqrt(l(l+1))ħ = sqrt(2)ħ ≈ 1.414ħ. So if the problem is referring to l=1 in QM terms, but using the Bohr model's energy levels, which depend on n, there's a disconnect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to ignore the discrepancy and proceed with the quantum mechanical treatment. Let's proceed under that assumption. \n\nFor a state with orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1, the magnetic quantum number m_l can be -1, 0, +1. The energy shift due to the magnetic field B is ΔE = μ_B B m_l. The total energy is then E = E_n (from part (a)) + ΔE. However, we need to know which n corresponds to l=1. In quantum mechanics, l can be up to n-1, so for l=1, n ≥ 2. But the problem doesn't specify n. Therefore, unless the problem assumes the lowest possible n for l=1, which is n=2, we can't proceed numerically. Assuming n=2, then E_n from part (a) is E_2 = -54.4 eV / 4 = -13.6 eV. Then the energies in the magnetic field would be -13.6 eV + μ_B B m_l. But the problem says \"calculate the energies\", which requires knowing B. However, the problem doesn't specify the magnetic field strength. Therefore, the answer must be expressed in terms of B. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the possible energy levels in terms of B. So for l=1 (which in QM requires n ≥ 2), the energy levels are E = E_n + μ_B B m_l. But without knowing n, we can't specify E_n. Therefore, the problem must have intended that we consider the same n as in part (a), but part (a) is general for any n. Therefore, the answer would be that the energies are E_n + μ_B B m_l for m_l = -1, 0, +1. But the problem says \"calculate the energies\", which might expect numerical values. However, without values for n and B, we can't compute numbers. Therefore, the answer must be expressed symbolically. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the energy levels of the l=1 state in a magnetic field, considering only the orbital contribution (normal Zeeman effect), and using the Bohr model's expression for the energy levels. Since the Bohr model's energy depends only on n, and l=1 would correspond to a specific n (which is not given), the problem is underspecified. However, if we assume that the l=1 state refers to the state with angular momentum quantum number l=1 in quantum mechanics, and we use the Bohr model's energy for the corresponding n (which would be n=2 for l=1), then E_n = -54.4 eV / 4 = -13.6 eV. Then the energies in the magnetic field would be -13.6 eV ± μ_B B and -13.6 eV. But μ_B is approximately 5.788 × 10^-5 eV/T. So if B is given in tesla, the energy shifts would be tiny compared to the -13.6 eV. However, the problem doesn't provide a value for B, so we can't compute numerical values. Therefore, the answer must be expressed as E = -54.4/n² eV + μ_B B m_l, where m_l = -1, 0, +1. But since the problem mentions \"the l = 1 state\", and l=1 implies n ≥ 2, but without knowing n, we can't give a numerical answer. \n\nThis suggests that there's missing information in the problem. However, given that it's a textbook problem, perhaps the intended answer is to recognize that the energy levels split into three levels separated by μ_B B, with the base energy from part (a). But part (a) is for He+ and any n, so the answer would be the energy levels are E_n plus the Zeeman shifts. But since the problem says \"calculate the energies\", maybe they want the expression in terms of n and B. Alternatively, if the problem assumes that the l=1 state is the first excited state (n=2), then E_2 = -54.4/4 = -13.6 eV, and the energies in the magnetic field are -13.6 eV + μ_B B m_l. But without knowing B, we can't compute numerical values. Therefore, the answer is that the energies are E = (-54.4/n² eV) + (μ_B B m_l), where m_l = -1, 0, +1. However, since the problem says \"calculate\", maybe they want the expression in terms of fundamental constants. \n\nAlternatively, using the Bohr model, the magnetic moment is μ = -(e/(2m_e)) L, and L = nħ. So for a state with angular momentum L = nħ, the magnetic moment is μ = - (e n ħ)/(2m_e) = -n μ_B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. The energy shift in a magnetic field B is ΔE = -μ·B = n μ_B B cosθ. But in the Bohr model, the orientation of the orbit might be quantized. However, historically, the Bohr model did not account for spatial quantization, which was introduced by Sommerfeld. If we assume that the orbit can be oriented such that the angular momentum is aligned with the field, then cosθ = 1, and ΔE = n μ_B B. But this would give a single energy shift, not multiple levels. However, this contradicts the quantum mechanical result where there are multiple m_l values. Therefore, the problem might be expecting the quantum mechanical result despite mentioning the Bohr model. \n\nGiven the confusion, I think the intended answer for part (b) is the normal Zeeman effect for l=1, leading to three energy levels separated by μ_B B, with the base energy from part (a). Since part (a) is for He+, the base energy would be E_n = -54.4/n² eV. However, without knowing n, we can't specify E_n. Therefore, the answer must be expressed as E = (-54.4/n² eV) + m_l μ_B B, where m_l = -1, 0, +1. But the problem says \"calculate the energies\", which might imply a numerical answer. If we assume that the l=1 state corresponds to n=2 in the Bohr model (since in QM l=1 is allowed for n=2), then E_n = -54.4/4 = -13.6 eV, and the energies are -13.6 eV + μ_B B m_l. But without a value for B, we can't compute numbers. Therefore, the answer is the expression with E_n plus the Zeeman term. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy levels in terms of the Bohr magneton and the magnetic field, without numerical values. So the final answer would be the three energies: E = E_n + μ_B B m_l for m_l = -1, 0, +1. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll proceed with this approach.\n</think>\n\n(a) To derive the energy levels of the $\\text{He}^+$ ion using the Bohr model, we start with the formula for hydrogen-like atoms. The energy levels are given by:  \n\\[\nE_n = -\\frac{Z^2 R_H}{n^2},\n\\]  \nwhere $Z$ is the atomic number, $R_H \\approx 13.6\\ \\text{eV}$ is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen, and $n$ is the principal quantum number. For $\\text{He}^+$, $Z = 2$. Substituting $Z$ into the formula:  \n\\[\nE_n = -\\frac{(2)^2 \\cdot 13.6\\ \\text{eV}}{n^2} = -\\frac{54.4\\ \\text{eV}}{n^2}.\n\\]  \nThus, the energy levels of $\\text{He}^+$ are:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{E_n = -\\frac{54.4\\ \\text{eV}}{n^2}}.\n\\]\n\n(b) For the $l = 1$ state in a magnetic field (neglecting spin), the energy levels split due to the normal Zeeman effect. The energy shift is:  \n\\[\n\\Delta E = \\mu_B B m_l,\n\\]  \nwhere $\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is the Bohr magneton, $B$ is the magnetic field strength, and $m_l = -1, 0, +1$ for $l = 1$. The total energy combines the result from part (a) with the Zeeman shift. Assuming the $l = 1$ state corresponds to a principal quantum number $n \\geq 2$ (e.g., $n = 2$ for the first excited state), the energies are:  \n\\[\nE = -\\frac{54.4\\ \\text{eV}}{n^2} + \\mu_B B m_l.\n\\]  \nFor $n = 2$, the base energy is $E_2 = -13.6\\ \\text{eV}$, and the three split energies are:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{E = -13.6\\ \\text{eV} + \\mu_B B m_l \\quad \\text{for} \\quad m_l = -1, 0, +1}.\n\\]", "final_answers": ["E_n = -\\frac{54.4\\ \\text{eV}}{n^2}", "E = -13.6\\ \\text{eV} + \\mu_B B m_l \\quad \\text{for} \\quad m_l = -1, 0, +1"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "E_n = -\\frac{54.4\\ \\text{eV}}{n^2}", "expr2": "E_n = -\\frac{2me^4}{(4\\pi \\varepsilon_0)^2 n^2 \\hbar^2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "E = -13.6\\ \\text{eV} + \\mu_B B m_l \\quad \\text{for} \\quad m_l = -1, 0, +1", "expr2": "E_n = -\\frac{2me^4}{(4\\pi \\varepsilon_0)^2 n^2 \\hbar^2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "E = -13.6\\ \\text{eV} + \\mu_B B m_l \\quad \\text{for} \\quad m_l = -1, 0, +1", "expr2": "\\Delta E = \\begin{cases} \n\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m} B, & (\\mu \\parallel B) \\\\ \n0, & (\\mu \\perp B) \\\\  \n-\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m} B. & (\\mu \\parallel -B) \n\\end{cases}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.5}
{"id": "atomic/1-25", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the probabilities of measuring the spin in the y-direction, specifically s_y = ±1/2, at any later time for a particle that starts with s_z = +1/2. The particle has a magnetic moment μ = μ0 s and is in a magnetic field B along the x-axis. Hmm, let's start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a spin-1/2 particle is in a magnetic field, the Hamiltonian is given by the interaction between the magnetic moment and the field. The formula should be H = -μ·B. Since the magnetic field is along the x-axis, B = B0 i (unit vector in x-direction), so the Hamiltonian becomes H = -μ0 B S_x, where S_x is the spin operator in the x-direction. Wait, but spin is in units of ħ/2, right? So maybe I need to express the spin operators in terms of Pauli matrices. Let me recall: for spin-1/2, S_i = (ħ/2) σ_i, where σ_i are the Pauli matrices. So substituting that into the Hamiltonian, H = -μ0 B (ħ/2) σ_x. Let me check the units here. Magnetic moment μ is usually given by μ = γ S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. But here it's given as μ = μ0 s, so maybe μ0 is the gyromagnetic ratio times some constants. Hmm, perhaps the exact expression isn't critical here as long as I can write the Hamiltonian in terms of σ_x. Let me just proceed.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is proportional to σ_x. So H = - (μ0 B ħ / 2) σ_x. Alternatively, maybe there's a negative sign depending on the direction. But the key point is that the energy levels are determined by the eigenvalues of S_x. Since the particle is in a magnetic field along x, the eigenstates of S_x are the ones with spin up or down along x. But the initial state is spin up along z. So the problem is about time evolution under H and finding the probabilities in the y-direction.\n\nWait, the initial state is s_z = +1/2, which is the spin-up state along z. Let's denote that as |↑z⟩. The time evolution is governed by the Hamiltonian H. To find the state at a later time t, I need to apply the time evolution operator U = exp(-i H t / ħ). Then, the state |ψ(t)⟩ = U |↑z⟩. Once I have |ψ(t)⟩, I can express it in the eigenbasis of S_y and compute the probabilities.\n\nBut first, let's write down H more explicitly. Let's factor out the constants. Let me define ω = (μ0 B)/ħ. Then H = - (μ0 B ħ / 2) σ_x = - (ħ ω / 2) σ_x. Wait, but maybe the negative sign is important here. Alternatively, maybe the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B, which would be -μ0 B S_x. Since S_x is (ħ/2) σ_x, then H = -μ0 B (ħ/2) σ_x. Let me check the signs. If the magnetic moment is μ = μ0 s, then the energy is -μ·B, so H = -μ0 s·B. Since B is along x, H = -μ0 B s_x. Then, s_x is dimensionless here? Wait, spin is in units of ħ/2. So s_x would be (S_x)/(ħ/2), so S_x = (ħ/2) s_x. Therefore, H = -μ0 B (ħ/2) s_x. But maybe the user is using s as the dimensionless spin operator with eigenvalues ±1/2. Wait, the problem states \"spin s of magnitude 1/2\", so s is the spin operator with magnitude 1/2. So perhaps S_x has eigenvalues ±1/2. Wait, but in standard notation, spin operators have eigenvalues ±ħ/2. Maybe the problem is using natural units where ħ = 1, so S_x has eigenvalues ±1/2. Then, the magnetic moment is μ = μ0 s, so μ_x = μ0 s_x. Then, the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B = -μ0 B s_x. So H = -μ0 B s_x. Since s_x has eigenvalues ±1/2, the energy eigenvalues would be -μ0 B (±1/2) = ∓ μ0 B / 2. So the energy splitting is μ0 B. Then, the time evolution will involve terms like exp(-i H t / ħ). But if ħ is set to 1 in these units, then H t / ħ becomes H t. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify units. Hmm. Maybe I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_x, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. But given the problem states μ = μ0 s, then H = -μ·B = -μ0 B s_x. So H is proportional to s_x. Since s is spin-1/2, s_x is the Pauli X matrix divided by 2. Wait, no. The spin matrices for spin-1/2 are S_x = ħ/2 σ_x, S_y = ħ/2 σ_y, S_z = ħ/2 σ_z. But if the problem is using s as the dimensionless spin operator (with eigenvalues ±1/2), then s_x = σ_x / 2. Wait, maybe not. Let me check. If s has magnitude 1/2, then the eigenvalues of s_z are ±1/2. So s is a vector operator where each component has eigenvalues ±1/2. Therefore, s_x, s_y, s_z are each operators with eigenvalues ±1/2. Therefore, s_x is (1/2) σ_x, s_y is (1/2) σ_y, s_z is (1/2) σ_z. Therefore, the Hamiltonian H = -μ0 B s_x = - (μ0 B / 2) σ_x. Then, the energy eigenvalues are -μ0 B / 2 * (±1) = ∓ μ0 B / 2. Therefore, the energy difference between the two states is μ0 B. The time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / ħ). Wait, but in this case, since H is expressed in terms of σ_x, and s is dimensionless, perhaps ħ is already incorporated into the units. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in units where ħ = 1. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to proceed.\n\nLet me denote ω = μ0 B / ħ. Then, H = - (ħ ω / 2) σ_x. Then, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ) = exp(i (ω t / 2) σ_x). Because H is proportional to σ_x, the exponential can be simplified using the identity exp(i θ σ_x) = I cos θ + i σ_x sin θ. So, U(t) = cos(ω t / 2) I + i sin(ω t / 2) σ_x. Let me verify that. Yes, for any Pauli matrix σ_i, exp(i θ σ_i) = I cos θ + i σ_i sin θ. So here, θ = ω t / 2. Therefore, U(t) = cos(ω t / 2) I + i sin(ω t / 2) σ_x.\n\nNow, the initial state is |↑z⟩, which is the eigenstate of σ_z with eigenvalue +1. In terms of the standard basis, |↑z⟩ is the vector (1; 0). Let's write that as a column vector: |↑z⟩ = [1; 0]. Then, applying U(t) to this state:\n\n|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t) |↑z⟩ = [cos(ω t / 2) I + i sin(ω t / 2) σ_x] [1; 0].\n\nCalculating this matrix multiplication. Let's compute σ_x [1; 0] first. σ_x is [[0, 1], [1, 0]], so σ_x [1; 0] = [0; 1]. Therefore:\n\nU(t) [1; 0] = cos(ω t / 2) [1; 0] + i sin(ω t / 2) [0; 1] = [cos(ω t / 2); i sin(ω t / 2)].\n\nSo the state at time t is |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ω t / 2) |↑z⟩ + i sin(ω t / 2) |↓z⟩. Wait, but |↓z⟩ is [0; 1], so that's correct.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of measuring s_y = ±1/2. The eigenstates of s_y are the states with spin up or down along y. Let's denote them as |↑y⟩ and |↓y⟩. The eigenvalues of s_y are ±1/2. To find the probabilities, we need to express |ψ(t)⟩ in the basis of |↑y⟩ and |↓y⟩ and then take the squared magnitudes of the coefficients.\n\nFirst, let's recall the eigenstates of σ_y (since s_y is proportional to σ_y). The eigenstates of σ_y with eigenvalues +1 and -1 are:\n\nFor eigenvalue +1: (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2\n\nFor eigenvalue -1: (|0⟩ - i|1⟩)/√2\n\nBut since s_y has eigenvalues ±1/2, the eigenstates would be the same as for σ_y, but scaled. Wait, if σ_y has eigenvalues ±1, then s_y = (1/2) σ_y has eigenvalues ±1/2. Therefore, the eigenstates |↑y⟩ and |↓y⟩ are the same as the eigenstates of σ_y with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively. Therefore:\n\n|↑y⟩ = (|↑z⟩ + i |↓z⟩)/√2\n\n|↓y⟩ = (|↑z⟩ - i |↓z⟩)/√2\n\nSo, to express |ψ(t)⟩ in terms of |↑y⟩ and |↓y⟩, we can write:\n\n|ψ(t)⟩ = a |↑y⟩ + b |↓y⟩\n\nThen, the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the inner products ⟨↑y | ψ(t) ⟩ and ⟨↓y | ψ(t) ⟩.\n\nLet's compute ⟨↑y | ψ(t) ⟩:\n\n⟨↑y | ψ(t) ⟩ = [ (⟨↑z| - i ⟨↓z| ) / √2 ] [ cos(ω t / 2) |↑z⟩ + i sin(ω t / 2) |↓z⟩ ]\n\nMultiplying this out:\n\n= (1/√2) [ ⟨↑z| cos(ω t / 2) |↑z⟩ - i ⟨↓z| cos(ω t / 2) |↑z⟩ + i ⟨↑z| sin(ω t / 2) |↓z⟩ + ⟨↓z| sin(ω t / 2) |↓z⟩ ]\n\nBut ⟨↑z | ↑z ⟩ = 1, ⟨↓z | ↑z ⟩ = 0, ⟨↑z | ↓z ⟩ = 0, ⟨↓z | ↓z ⟩ = 1. So simplifying:\n\n= (1/√2) [ cos(ω t / 2) * 1 + 0 + 0 + sin(ω t / 2) * 1 * i ]\n\nWait, wait, let's redo that step carefully. Let's distribute the terms:\n\nFirst term: (⟨↑z| cos(ω t / 2) |↑z⟩ ) = cos(ω t / 2) * ⟨↑z | ↑z ⟩ = cos(ω t / 2) * 1\n\nSecond term: (-i ⟨↓z| cos(ω t / 2) |↑z⟩ ) = -i cos(ω t / 2) * ⟨↓z | ↑z ⟩ = 0\n\nThird term: (i ⟨↑z| sin(ω t / 2) |↓z⟩ ) = i sin(ω t / 2) * ⟨↑z | ↓z ⟩ = 0\n\nFourth term: (⟨↓z| sin(ω t / 2) |↓z⟩ ) = sin(ω t / 2) * ⟨↓z | ↓z ⟩ = sin(ω t / 2) * 1\n\nWait, but the original expression after expanding is:\n\n= (1/√2) [ cos(ω t / 2) ⟨↑z | ↑z ⟩ - i cos(ω t / 2) ⟨↓z | ↑z ⟩ + i sin(ω t / 2) ⟨↑z | ↓z ⟩ + sin(ω t / 2) ⟨↓z | ↓z ⟩ ]\n\nSo substituting the inner products:\n\n= (1/√2) [ cos(ω t / 2) * 1 - i cos(ω t / 2) * 0 + i sin(ω t / 2) * 0 + sin(ω t / 2) * 1 ]\n\nTherefore, simplifies to:\n\n= (1/√2) [ cos(ω t / 2) + sin(ω t / 2) ]\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original state |ψ(t)⟩ is cos(ω t / 2) |↑z⟩ + i sin(ω t / 2) |↓z⟩. So when we take the inner product with ⟨↑y |, which is (⟨↑z| - i ⟨↓z| ) / √2, we have:\n\n⟨↑y | ψ(t) ⟩ = [ (⟨↑z| - i ⟨↓z| ) / √2 ] [ cos(ω t / 2) |↑z⟩ + i sin(ω t / 2) |↓z⟩ ]\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\n= (1/√2) [ ⟨↑z | cos(ω t / 2) |↑z ⟩ + ⟨↑z | i sin(ω t / 2) |↓z ⟩ - i ⟨↓z | cos(ω t / 2) |↑z ⟩ - i^2 ⟨↓z | sin(ω t / 2) |↓z ⟩ ]\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: cos(ω t / 2) * ⟨↑z | ↑z ⟩ = cos(ω t / 2) * 1\n\nSecond term: i sin(ω t / 2) * ⟨↑z | ↓z ⟩ = i sin(ω t / 2) * 0 = 0\n\nThird term: -i cos(ω t / 2) * ⟨↓z | ↑z ⟩ = -i cos(ω t / 2) * 0 = 0\n\nFourth term: -i^2 sin(ω t / 2) * ⟨↓z | ↓z ⟩ = -(-1) sin(ω t / 2) * 1 = sin(ω t / 2)\n\nTherefore, combining first and fourth terms:\n\n= (1/√2) [ cos(ω t / 2) + sin(ω t / 2) ]\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the amplitude for |↑y⟩ is [cos(ω t / 2) + sin(ω t / 2)] / √2.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute the amplitude for |↓y⟩. The state |↓y⟩ is (|↑z⟩ - i |↓z⟩)/√2. So ⟨↓y | ψ(t) ⟩ = [ (⟨↑z| + i ⟨↓z| ) / √2 ] [ cos(ω t / 2) |↑z⟩ + i sin(ω t / 2) |↓z⟩ ]\n\nFollowing similar steps:\n\n= (1/√2) [ ⟨↑z | cos(ω t / 2) |↑z ⟩ + ⟨↑z | i sin(ω t / 2) |↓z ⟩ + i ⟨↓z | cos(ω t / 2) |↑z ⟩ + i^2 ⟨↓z | sin(ω t / 2) |↓z ⟩ ]\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: cos(ω t / 2) * 1\n\nSecond term: i sin(ω t / 2) * 0 = 0\n\nThird term: i cos(ω t / 2) * 0 = 0\n\nFourth term: i^2 sin(ω t / 2) * 1 = -1 * sin(ω t / 2)\n\nTherefore, combining first and fourth terms:\n\n= (1/√2) [ cos(ω t / 2) - sin(ω t / 2) ]\n\nSo the amplitudes are:\n\na = [cos(ω t / 2) + sin(ω t / 2)] / √2\n\nb = [cos(ω t / 2) - sin(ω t / 2)] / √2\n\nTherefore, the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.\n\nLet's compute |a|^2:\n\n|a|^2 = (1/2) [cos(ω t / 2) + sin(ω t / 2)]^2\n\nSimilarly, |b|^2 = (1/2) [cos(ω t / 2) - sin(ω t / 2)]^2\n\nExpanding these:\n\nFor |a|^2:\n\n= (1/2)[cos²(ω t / 2) + 2 cos(ω t / 2) sin(ω t / 2) + sin²(ω t / 2)]\n\n= (1/2)[ (cos² + sin²) + 2 sin cos ]\n\n= (1/2)[1 + sin(ω t)]\n\nSimilarly, for |b|^2:\n\n= (1/2)[cos²(ω t / 2) - 2 cos(ω t / 2) sin(ω t / 2) + sin²(ω t / 2)]\n\n= (1/2)[1 - sin(ω t)]\n\nTherefore, the probabilities are:\n\nP(s_y = +1/2) = [1 + sin(ω t)] / 2\n\nP(s_y = -1/2) = [1 - sin(ω t)] / 2\n\nBut wait, ω was defined as μ0 B / ħ. Let me check that again. Earlier, I tried to define ω = μ0 B / ħ. Let's confirm:\n\nWe had H = -μ0 B s_x. Since s_x is (1/2) σ_x, then H = -μ0 B (σ_x / 2). Then, the time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / ħ). Substituting H:\n\nexp( i μ0 B σ_x t / (2 ħ) )\n\nTherefore, the frequency ω in the sine and cosine terms is μ0 B / (2 ħ) * t? Wait, no. Let me see. The argument of the exponential is (i μ0 B σ_x t) / (2 ħ). So when we write the time evolution operator as exp(i θ σ_x), θ = μ0 B t / (2 ħ). Therefore, in the expressions for the probabilities, the argument of the sine is ω t, where ω = μ0 B / ħ. Wait, let's see:\n\nIn the time evolution, we had U(t) = cos(ω t / 2) + i σ_x sin(ω t / 2). Wait, earlier when I defined ω = μ0 B / ħ, then H = - (ħ ω / 2) σ_x. Then, the time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / ħ) = exp(i ω t σ_x / 2). Therefore, the angle θ in the exponential is ω t / 2. Therefore, when we computed the amplitudes, the arguments of sine and cosine were ω t / 2. But in the probabilities, we ended up with sin(ω t). Wait, how did that happen?\n\nWait, in the probabilities, we have sin(ω t). Let's check the algebra again. When expanding [cos(θ) + sin(θ)]², where θ = ω t / 2, we get cos²θ + 2 cosθ sinθ + sin²θ = 1 + sin(2θ). Therefore, sin(2θ) = sin(ω t). Similarly, [cosθ - sinθ]^2 = 1 - sin(2θ). Therefore, the probabilities are (1 ± sin(ω t))/2. So the frequency in the sine term is ω t, where ω = μ0 B / ħ. Therefore, the probabilities oscillate with frequency ω = μ0 B / ħ.\n\nTherefore, the final probabilities are:\n\nP(+1/2) = [1 + sin(μ0 B t / ħ)] / 2\n\nP(-1/2) = [1 - sin(μ0 B t / ħ)] / 2\n\nBut let me check the units. The argument of the sine should be dimensionless. μ0 has units of magnetic moment per spin (since μ = μ0 s). B is magnetic field. So μ0 B has units of energy. Then, μ0 B t / ħ has units of (energy * time) / action, which is dimensionless. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we define ω = μ0 B / ħ, then the probabilities are (1 ± sin(ω t))/2. So the answer is that the probabilities oscillate sinusoidally with frequency ω = μ0 B / ħ.\n\nBut let me check if I made a mistake in the sign somewhere. The Hamiltonian was H = -μ0 B s_x. Then, the time evolution is exp(-i H t / ħ) = exp(i μ0 B s_x t / ħ). Since s_x is (σ_x)/2, this becomes exp(i μ0 B σ_x t / (2 ħ)). Therefore, the angle in the exponential is (μ0 B t)/(2 ħ) σ_x, so θ = μ0 B t / (2 ħ). Therefore, when we computed the probabilities, the argument of the sine is 2θ = μ0 B t / ħ. Therefore, sin(2θ) = sin(μ0 B t / ħ). Therefore, the probabilities are indeed (1 ± sin(μ0 B t / ħ))/2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that the probability of measuring s_y = +1/2 is [1 + sin(μ0 B t / ħ)] / 2 and s_y = -1/2 is [1 - sin(μ0 B t / ħ)] / 2.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Suppose we write the initial state |↑z⟩ in terms of |↑x⟩ and |↓x⟩, since the Hamiltonian is diagonal in the x-basis. The eigenstates of S_x are |↑x⟩ = (|↑z⟩ + |↓z⟩)/√2 and |↓x⟩ = (|↑z⟩ - |↓z⟩)/√2. The eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, but in our case, since s_x has eigenvalues ±1/2, the energy eigenvalues are -μ0 B (±1/2). So the time evolution would be a phase factor for each eigenstate.\n\nBut the initial state |↑z⟩ can be written as (|↑x⟩ + |↓x⟩)/√2. Then, each component evolves with its own phase. Let's see:\n\n|ψ(t)⟩ = (e^{-i E_+ t / ħ} |↑x⟩ + e^{-i E_- t / ħ} |↓x⟩)/√2\n\nWhere E_+ = -μ0 B (1/2) and E_- = -μ0 B (-1/2) = μ0 B / 2. Therefore:\n\nE_+ = -μ0 B / 2\n\nE_- = μ0 B / 2\n\nTherefore, the time evolution factors are:\n\ne^{-i (-μ0 B / 2) t / ħ} = e^{i μ0 B t / (2 ħ)}\n\ne^{-i (μ0 B / 2) t / ħ} = e^{-i μ0 B t / (2 ħ)}\n\nTherefore,\n\n|ψ(t)⟩ = [ e^{i μ0 B t / (2 ħ)} |↑x⟩ + e^{-i μ0 B t / (2 ħ)} |↓x⟩ ] / √2\n\nExpressing |↑x⟩ and |↓x⟩ in terms of |↑z⟩ and |↓z⟩:\n\n|↑x⟩ = (|↑z⟩ + |↓z⟩)/√2\n\n|↓x⟩ = (|↑z⟩ - |↓z⟩)/√2\n\nSubstituting back:\n\n|ψ(t)⟩ = [ e^{i ω t / 2} (|↑z⟩ + |↓z⟩)/√2 + e^{-i ω t / 2} (|↑z⟩ - |↓z⟩)/√2 ] / √2\n\nWhere ω = μ0 B / ħ.\n\nSimplifying:\n\n= [ e^{i ω t / 2} (|↑z⟩ + |↓z⟩) + e^{-i ω t / 2} (|↑z⟩ - |↓z⟩) ] / 2\n\nExpanding the terms:\n\n= [ (e^{i ω t / 2} + e^{-i ω t / 2}) |↑z⟩ + (e^{i ω t / 2} - e^{-i ω t / 2}) |↓z⟩ ] / 2\n\nUsing Euler's formula:\n\n= [ 2 cos(ω t / 2) |↑z⟩ + 2i sin(ω t / 2) |↓z⟩ ] / 2\n\n= cos(ω t / 2) |↑z⟩ + i sin(ω t / 2) |↓z⟩\n\nWhich matches the earlier result. So the state is indeed as we found before. Then, when we express this in the y-basis, we get the probabilities as (1 ± sin(ω t))/2. Therefore, the probabilities oscillate with frequency ω = μ0 B / ħ.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that the probabilities are [1 ± sin(μ0 B t / ħ)] / 2 for s_y = ±1/2 respectively.\n\nBut let me check if there's a simpler way to see this. The Hamiltonian causes precession of the spin around the x-axis. Starting from the z-direction, the spin will precess in the y-z plane with angular frequency ω. The probability of measuring s_y = +1/2 would then depend on the component of the spin in the y-direction. Since the precession is around x, the y and z components will vary sinusoidally. However, the initial state is along z, so the expectation value of S_z will oscillate, but we're measuring S_y. Wait, but precession around x would mean that the spin vector rotates in the y-z plane. So if it starts along z, after a quarter period, it would point along y, then -z, then -y, etc. Therefore, the probability of measuring s_y = +1/2 would reach 1 at times when the spin is aligned along +y. Let's see if our result matches this intuition.\n\nOur result is P(+1/2) = [1 + sin(ω t)] / 2. So when sin(ω t) = 1 (i.e., ω t = π/2, 5π/2, ...), P = 1. Similarly, when sin(ω t) = -1, P = 0. That seems to align with the precession picture. At ω t = π/2, the spin has precessed to +y direction, so probability of s_y = +1/2 is 1. At ω t = 3π/2, it's pointing along -y, so probability of s_y = +1/2 is 0. So the formula makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the probabilities are indeed [1 ± sin(ω t)] / 2 with ω = μ0 B / ħ. Therefore, the final answer should be:\n\nFor s_y = +1/2: [1 + sin(μ0 B t / ħ)] / 2\n\nFor s_y = -1/2: [1 - sin(μ0 B t / ħ)] / 2\n\nExpressed in boxed notation:\n\nThe probabilities are \\[ \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 \\pm \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\mu_0 B t}{\\hbar}\\right)\\right)} \\]\n</think>\n\nTo determine the probabilities of finding the particle with \\( s_y = \\pm 1/2 \\) at any later time, we start with the Hamiltonian for a spin-\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) particle in a magnetic field along the \\( x \\)-axis.

{"id": "atomic/1-22", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to estimate the Doppler width of an emission line for argon at 300 K. The wavelength given is 5000 Ångströms. Hmm, Doppler broadening is related to the thermal motion of the atoms, right? The Doppler width is the broadening of the spectral line due to the random thermal velocities of the emitting atoms. \n\nFirst, I remember that the Doppler width Δλ can be calculated using the formula:\n\nΔλ ≈ λ * sqrt( (2 k T) / (m c²) )\n\nWhere:\n- λ is the wavelength,\n- k is Boltzmann's constant,\n- T is the temperature,\n- m is the mass of the atom,\n- c is the speed of light.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the exact formula. Another version I recall is that the Doppler width in terms of frequency is Δν ≈ ν₀ * sqrt( (2 k T) / (m c²) ), but since we need the width in wavelength, maybe there's a conversion between Δν and Δλ. Since λν = c, so Δλ/λ ≈ Δν/ν. Therefore, Δλ ≈ λ * (Δν / ν) ≈ λ * sqrt( (2 k T) / (m c²) ). So that formula should work.\n\nBut let me confirm. The thermal velocity v is given by sqrt( (2 k T) / m ), right? Then the Doppler shift is v/c, so the width would be proportional to (v/c) * λ. So putting it together, Δλ ≈ λ * (v/c) = λ * sqrt( (2 k T) / (m c²) ). Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo now I need to compute this. Let's plug in the numbers. Let's note the constants:\n\n- λ = 5000 Å = 5000 × 10^-10 m = 5 × 10^-7 m\n- T = 300 K\n- Argon has atomic mass A = 40, so the mass of one atom m = 40 atomic mass units. 1 u ≈ 1.66 × 10^-27 kg, so m = 40 × 1.66 × 10^-27 kg ≈ 6.64 × 10^-26 kg\n- k = Boltzmann constant ≈ 1.38 × 10^-23 J/K\n- c = 3 × 10^8 m/s\n\nSo let's compute the term inside the square root first: (2 k T) / (m c²)\n\nCalculating numerator: 2 * 1.38e-23 J/K * 300 K = 2 * 1.38e-23 * 300 ≈ 2 * 4.14e-21 ≈ 8.28e-21 J\n\nDenominator: m c² = 6.64e-26 kg * (9e16 m²/s²) = 6.64e-26 * 9e16 ≈ 5.976e-9 kg m²/s²\n\nSo the ratio is 8.28e-21 / 5.976e-9 ≈ 1.385e-12\n\nTaking the square root of that: sqrt(1.385e-12) ≈ 1.176e-6\n\nThen multiply by λ: 5e-7 m * 1.176e-6 ≈ 5.88e-13 m\n\nWait, but converting that back to Ångströms, since 1 Å = 1e-10 m, so 5.88e-13 m = 5.88e-3 Å ≈ 0.00588 Å. Hmm, that seems really small. But wait, maybe I made a calculation error.\n\nLet me check the steps again.\n\nFirst, m = 40 u. 1 u is 1.66e-27 kg, so 40 * 1.66e-27 = 6.64e-26 kg. Correct.\n\nNumerator: 2 * k * T = 2 * 1.38e-23 * 300 = 2 * 1.38 * 300e-23 = 2 * 414e-23 = 828e-23 = 8.28e-21 J. Correct.\n\nDenominator: m c² = 6.64e-26 kg * (3e8)^2 = 6.64e-26 * 9e16 = 6.64 * 9e-10 = 59.76e-10 = 5.976e-9 kg m²/s². Correct.\n\nSo ratio is 8.28e-21 / 5.976e-9 ≈ (8.28 / 5.976) * 1e-12 ≈ 1.385 * 1e-12 ≈ 1.385e-12. Square root is sqrt(1.385e-12) ≈ sqrt(1.385)*1e-6 ≈ 1.176e-6. Multiply by λ (5e-7 m): 5e-7 * 1.176e-6 ≈ 5.88e-13 m. Convert to Å: 5.88e-13 m / 1e-10 m/Å = 5.88e-3 Å ≈ 0.0059 Å. That's about 0.006 Å. But is that the right order of magnitude?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me check another source. The Doppler width (Δλ) is given by Δλ = λ * sqrt( (8 k T ln 2) / (m c²) ). Wait, sometimes the formula includes a factor of sqrt(8 ln 2) or similar. Because the Doppler broadening is related to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is calculated with that factor.\n\nAh, right! The formula I used earlier gives the standard deviation, but the Doppler width is usually quoted as the FWHM. So the correct formula includes a factor of sqrt(8 ln 2) in the calculation. Let me check that.\n\nThe thermal velocity distribution leads to a Gaussian line profile, and the FWHM of a Gaussian is 2 sqrt(2 ln 2) times the standard deviation. So the standard deviation in wavelength is λ * sqrt( (k T)/(m c²) ), and the FWHM would be 2 sqrt(2 ln 2) * λ * sqrt( (k T)/(m c²) ) = λ * sqrt( (8 ln 2 k T)/(m c²) )\n\nSo perhaps I missed the factor of 8 ln 2. Let me recalculate with that.\n\nSo the correct formula for Doppler width (FWHM) is:\n\nΔλ = λ * sqrt( (8 ln 2 * k T) / (m c²) )\n\nSo let's compute that. Let's compute 8 ln 2 ≈ 8 * 0.693 ≈ 5.544\n\nSo the term inside the square root becomes (5.544 * k T) / (m c²)\n\nSo numerator: 5.544 * 1.38e-23 * 300 ≈ 5.544 * 1.38 * 300e-23 ≈ 5.544 * 414e-23 ≈ 2295.816e-23 ≈ 2.2958e-20 J\n\nDenominator: same as before, m c² = 5.976e-9 kg m²/s²\n\nSo ratio: 2.2958e-20 / 5.976e-9 ≈ 3.84e-12\n\nSquare root of that: sqrt(3.84e-12) ≈ 1.96e-6\n\nMultiply by λ (5e-7 m): 5e-7 * 1.96e-6 ≈ 9.8e-13 m\n\nConvert to Å: 9.8e-13 m / 1e-10 m/Å = 9.8e-3 Å ≈ 0.0098 Å. So approximately 0.01 Å. That's the FWHM Doppler width.\n\nBut the question says \"order of magnitude\". So 0.01 Å is 1e-2 Å. But maybe my calculation is off by a factor somewhere. Let me check the constants again.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the ratio with the corrected formula:\n\nΔλ = λ * sqrt( (8 ln 2 k T) / (m c²) )\n\nCompute 8 ln2 ≈ 5.545\n\nSo:\n\nNumerator: 5.545 * 1.38e-23 * 300 = 5.545 * 1.38 * 300e-23\n\nFirst, 5.545 * 1.38 ≈ 7.65\n\nThen 7.65 * 300 = 2295\n\nSo numerator ≈ 2295e-23 = 2.295e-20 J\n\nDenominator: m c² = 6.64e-26 * 9e16 = 6.64e-26 * 9e16 = 59.76e-10 = 5.976e-9 J (since 1 J = 1 kg m²/s²)\n\nSo ratio: 2.295e-20 / 5.976e-9 ≈ 3.84e-12\n\nsqrt(3.84e-12) = sqrt(3.84)*1e-6 ≈ 1.96e-6\n\nMultiply by λ (5e-7 m): 5e-7 * 1.96e-6 = 9.8e-13 m = 9.8e-3 Å ≈ 0.01 Å. So that's 1e-2 Å. The order of magnitude is 1e-2 Å. But maybe the question expects a different approach?\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the Doppler width is approximated as Δλ/λ ≈ v/c, where v is the thermal speed. The thermal speed v is sqrt( (3kT)/m ), but wait, that's the root mean square speed. Wait, the RMS speed is sqrt(3kT/m), and the average speed is sqrt(8kT/(π m)), and the most probable speed is sqrt(2kT/m). So depending on which speed is used, the factor changes.\n\nBut in the Doppler broadening formula, the relevant speed is the most probable speed or something else? Let me recall. The Doppler shift for a single atom is Δλ/λ = v/c. The distribution of velocities leads to a distribution of Doppler shifts. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution gives the velocity distribution. The resulting line profile is a Gaussian with a width determined by the thermal motion. The FWHM of the Gaussian is related to the standard deviation by FWHM = 2 sqrt(2 ln 2) σ. The standard deviation σ in terms of velocity is sqrt(kT/m). Wait, no. The velocity distribution in one dimension (since we're considering the line of sight velocity) has a standard deviation of sqrt(kT/m). So the standard deviation in velocity v is sqrt(kT/m). Then the standard deviation in wavelength would be σ_λ = λ * σ_v / c = λ * sqrt(kT/m)/c. Then the FWHM is 2 sqrt(2 ln 2) σ_λ = 2 sqrt(2 ln 2) * λ * sqrt(kT/m)/c. Let's compute that.\n\nSo:\n\nFWHM Δλ = 2 * sqrt(2 ln 2) * λ * sqrt( k T / (m c²) )\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nΔλ = λ * sqrt( (8 ln 2 k T) / (m c²) )\n\nWhich matches the formula I used earlier. So that's correct.\n\nSo my calculation of 0.01 Å seems right. But let's check if the order of magnitude is 1e-2 Å. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the mass. Let me check the mass again.\n\nArgon has A = 40, so molar mass is 40 g/mol. The mass per atom is 40 g/mol / Avogadro's number. Avogadro's number is ~6.022e23 mol⁻¹. So m = 0.040 kg/mol / 6.022e23 mol⁻¹ ≈ 6.64e-26 kg. Which matches what I had before. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the use of the RMS velocity instead of the FWHM. But the standard formula for Doppler width is the FWHM as I calculated. Let me check some references. For example, in Doppler broadening, the FWHM is given by:\n\nΔλ_FWHM = (2 λ / c) * sqrt( 2 k T ln 2 / m )\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nΔλ_FWHM = λ * sqrt( (8 k T ln 2) / (m c²) )\n\nWhich is the same as before. So yes, the calculation is correct.\n\nSo the result is approximately 0.01 Å. The order of magnitude is 1e-2 Å. So the answer should be \\boxed{10^{-2} \\text{ Å}}.\n\nBut let me check if other sources give similar values. For example, at room temperature (300 K), typical Doppler widths for visible lines are on the order of 0.01 to 0.1 Å. For example, for a lighter atom like hydrogen, the Doppler width would be larger because m is smaller. Since argon is heavier (A=40), the Doppler width should be smaller. So 0.01 Å seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the RMS velocity, sqrt(3kT/m), then the Doppler width would be λ * sqrt(3kT/m)/c. Let's compute that:\n\nsqrt(3kT/m) = sqrt(3 * 1.38e-23 * 300 / 6.64e-26) ≈ sqrt( (3 * 1.38 * 300) / 6.64e3 ) ≈ sqrt(1242 / 6.64e3) ≈ sqrt(0.187) ≈ 0.432 m/s. Wait, no, units are messed up. Let me compute properly.\n\nWait, 3kT/m = 3 * 1.38e-23 J/K * 300 K / 6.64e-26 kg\n\nJoules are kg m²/s², so units are (kg m²/s²) / kg = m²/s². So sqrt(3kT/m) is m/s.\n\nCompute numerator: 3 * 1.38e-23 * 300 = 3 * 1.38 * 300e-23 = 3 * 414e-23 = 1242e-23 = 1.242e-20\n\nDivide by m: 1.242e-20 / 6.64e-26 ≈ 1.87e5\n\nsqrt(1.87e5) ≈ 432 m/s\n\nSo RMS velocity is ~432 m/s. Then the Doppler shift is v/c = 432 / 3e8 ≈ 1.44e-6. Multiply by λ (5000 Å): 5000 * 1.44e-6 ≈ 0.0072 Å. So that's about 0.007 Å. But this is the RMS deviation, not the FWHM. To get FWHM from RMS, for a Gaussian, FWHM = 2.355 * σ. So 0.0072 Å * 2.355 ≈ 0.017 Å. Which is about 0.02 Å. But earlier calculation with the FWHM formula gave 0.01 Å. Hmm, discrepancy here. Why?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is between different conventions. Let me check again.\n\nThe RMS velocity is sqrt(3kT/m). The standard deviation in one direction (say, along the line of sight) is sqrt(kT/m). So the standard deviation in velocity is sqrt(kT/m). Then the standard deviation in wavelength is σ_λ = λ * σ_v / c = λ * sqrt(kT/m)/c. Then the FWHM is 2.355 * σ_λ. So:\n\nFWHM = 2.355 * λ * sqrt(kT/(m c²))\n\nLet's compute that.\n\nsqrt(kT/(m c²)):\n\nkT = 1.38e-23 * 300 = 4.14e-21 J\n\nm c² = 6.64e-26 * 9e16 = 5.976e-9 J\n\nSo kT/(m c²) = 4.14e-21 / 5.976e-9 ≈ 6.925e-13\n\nsqrt(6.925e-13) ≈ 8.32e-7\n\nMultiply by λ (5e-7 m): 5e-7 * 8.32e-7 ≈ 4.16e-13 m = 4.16e-3 Å\n\nThen multiply by 2.355: 4.16e-3 * 2.355 ≈ 9.8e-3 Å ≈ 0.0098 Å, which matches the previous result of ~0.01 Å. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the RMS velocity (sqrt(3kT/m)) gives a larger velocity, but when calculating the FWHM, we use the standard deviation in one direction, which is sqrt(kT/m), not the RMS velocity. So the correct FWHM is indeed ~0.01 Å.\n\nTherefore, the order of magnitude is 1e-2 Å. So the answer should be \\boxed{10^{-2} \\text{ Å}}.\n</think>\n\nTo estimate the Doppler width of an emission line for argon at 300 K, we use the formula for the full width at half maximum (FWHM) due to Doppler broadening:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta \\lambda = \\lambda \\sqrt{\\frac{8 \\ln 2 \\, k T}{m c^2}}\n\\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Wavelength \\(\\lambda = 5000 \\, \\text{Å} = 5 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}\\)\n- Temperature \\(T = 300 \\, \\text{K}\\)\n- Atomic mass \\(A = 40\\), so mass \\(m = 40 \\times 1.66 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\text{kg} = 6.64 \\times 10^{-26} \\, \\text{kg}\\)\n- Boltzmann constant \\(k = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J/K}\\)\n- Speed of light \\(c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. **Numerator:** \\(8 \\ln 2 \\, k T = 5.544 \\times 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\times 300 = 2.295 \\times 10^{-20} \\, \\text{J}\\)\n2. **Denominator:** \\(m c^2 = 6.64 \\times 10^{-26} \\times (3 \\times 10^8)^2 = 5.976 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{J}\\)\n3. **Ratio:** \\(\\frac{2.295 \\times 10^{-20}}{5.976 \\times 10^{-9}} \\approx 3.84 \\times 10^{-12}\\)\n4. **Square root:** \\(\\sqrt{3.84 \\times 10^{-12}} \\approx 1.96 \\times 10^{-6}\\)\n5. **Multiply by \\(\\lambda\\):** \\(5 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m} \\times 1.96 \\times 10^{-6} \\approx 9.8 \\times 10^{-13} \\, \\text{m} = 0.0098 \\, \\text{Å}\\)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Doppler width is approximately \\(0.01 \\, \\text{Å}\\), so the order of magnitude is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10^{-2} \\, \\text{Å}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["10^{-2} \\text{ Å}", "10^{-2} \\text{ Å}", "10^{-2} \\, \\text{Å}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "10^{-2} \\text{ Å}", "expr2": "\\Delta \\lambda \\approx 1.44 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\text{Å}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "10^{-2} \\text{ Å}", "expr2": "\\Delta \\lambda \\approx 1.44 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\text{Å}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "10^{-2} \\, \\text{Å}", "expr2": "\\Delta \\lambda \\approx 1.44 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\text{Å}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/2-33", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out why alpha decay is favored over other disintegration modes like emitting protons, deuterons, tritons, or fission. The question breaks it down into two parts: energy release and Coulomb barrier. Let me start by recalling what I know about alpha decay and the factors that influence radioactive decay processes.\n\nFirst, part (a) is about energy release. I remember that for a decay to happen spontaneously, the process must be exothermic, meaning the mass of the parent nucleus must be greater than the sum of the masses of the daughter nucleus and the emitted particle. The energy released here is called the Q-value. If the Q-value is positive, the decay is energetically possible. So, maybe alpha particles have a higher Q-value compared to other emissions? Let me think. The alpha particle is a helium-4 nucleus, which is very tightly bound. Because of its high binding energy per nucleon, emitting an alpha particle might result in a more significant mass loss, hence a higher Q-value. In contrast, emitting a proton, deuteron (²H), or triton (³H) would not release as much energy because those particles have lower binding energies. For example, a proton isn't bound at all in a nucleus by itself, so emitting a proton would require the parent nucleus to have enough mass excess to account for the proton's mass plus the daughter's. But since protons are lighter, maybe the Q-value is lower? Wait, but the binding energy of the daughter also matters. If the daughter after proton emission is less stable, maybe the Q-value isn't as favorable. Also, fission involves splitting into two large fragments, which might release a lot of energy, but perhaps it's less common because of the Coulomb barrier? Hmm, but the question is why alpha decay is favored over fission as well. Wait, maybe fission is a different process. Let me check.\n\nFor part (a), energy release: Alpha decay is favored because the alpha particle has a very high binding energy. When a nucleus emits an alpha particle, the mass difference (and thus the Q-value) is more likely to be positive compared to emitting other particles. For example, the binding energy per nucleon for an alpha particle is about 7 MeV per nucleon, which is higher than for individual protons or deuterons. So, the mass of the parent nucleus minus the mass of the daughter and the alpha particle is more likely to be positive. If the Q-value is higher, the decay is more probable. So, alpha decay releases more energy, making it more favorable.\n\nNow part (b) is about the Coulomb barrier. The Coulomb barrier is the energy barrier that the emitted particle must overcome due to the repulsion between the charged particle and the daughter nucleus. The height of the barrier depends on the charges of the particles and their sizes. The alpha particle has a charge of +2e, and the daughter has a charge of (Z-2)e. The Coulomb barrier height is proportional to the product of the charges divided by the sum of the radii. For a proton, the charge is +1e, so the product is (Z-1)e * 1e = (Z-1)e². For an alpha particle, it's (Z-2)e * 2e = 2(Z-2)e². Wait, but the Coulomb barrier is higher for higher charge products. So, the barrier for alpha emission would be higher than for proton emission. But if the barrier is higher, the probability of tunneling through it would be lower. However, the decay rate depends on both the barrier height and the energy of the particle. Even though the Coulomb barrier is higher for alpha particles, the energy released (Q-value) is also higher. The probability of tunneling depends exponentially on the ratio of the barrier height to the energy. So, even with a higher barrier, if the Q-value is sufficiently large, the tunneling probability might still be higher. Let me recall the Gamow factor, which is part of the calculation for the decay rate. The Gamow factor is proportional to Z_1 Z_2 sqrt(m/(E)), where Z_1 and Z_2 are the charges of the daughter and emitted particle, m is the mass of the emitted particle, and E is the kinetic energy (Q-value). So, for alpha decay, Z1 is (Z-2), Z2 is 2, m is 4 u. For proton emission, Z1 is (Z-1), Z2 is 1, m is 1 u. Let's compare the exponents. The Gamow factor for alpha: G_alpha ~ (2(Z-2)) * sqrt(4/(E_alpha)). For proton: G_proton ~ (Z-1) * sqrt(1/(E_proton)). The tunneling probability is proportional to exp(-G). So, even though 2(Z-2) might be larger than (Z-1), if E_alpha is much larger than E_proton, the sqrt(4/E_alpha) could be smaller than sqrt(1/E_proton). For example, if E_alpha is, say, 5 MeV and E_proton is 1 MeV (assuming lower Q-value for proton emission), then sqrt(4/5) ≈ sqrt(0.8) ≈ 0.89, and sqrt(1/1) = 1. So, G_alpha ≈ 2(Z-2)*0.89, G_proton ≈ (Z-1)*1. If Z is large, say Z=90, then 2*(88)=176 *0.89 ≈ 156.6, and (89)*1=89. Wait, that would make G_alpha larger than G_proton, meaning the exponent is more negative, so tunneling probability is lower. But this contradicts the fact that alpha decay is more common. Hmm, maybe my assumption about the Q-values is wrong. If the Q-value for alpha decay is much higher, then E_alpha is higher, making sqrt(m/(E)) smaller. Let's take E_alpha as 5 MeV and E_proton as, say, 2 MeV. Then for alpha: sqrt(4/5) ≈ 0.89, for proton: sqrt(1/2) ≈ 0.71. Then G_alpha = 2*(Z-2)*0.89, G_proton = (Z-1)*0.71. For Z=90: G_alpha=2*88*0.89≈156.6, G_proton=89*0.71≈63.2. So G_alpha is still larger. But alpha decay is more probable. Wait, maybe the mass also plays a role. The mass in the Gamow factor is the reduced mass, but maybe I need to check the exact formula. The Gamow factor is given by G = (π sqrt(2m)) / ħ) * (Z1 Z2 e²)/(2 sqrt(E)) ). So the exponent in the tunneling probability is proportional to Z1 Z2 sqrt(m/(E)). So for alpha vs proton, even though Z1 Z2 is higher for alpha, if sqrt(m/E) is lower enough, the product could be lower. Let's compute for Z=90, E_alpha=5 MeV, E_proton=2 MeV. For alpha: Z1=88, Z2=2, m=4u. For proton: Z1=89, Z2=1, m=1u. Then:\n\nG_alpha ∝ 88*2 * sqrt(4/5) ≈ 176 * 0.894 ≈ 157.3\n\nG_proton ∝ 89*1 * sqrt(1/2) ≈ 89 * 0.707 ≈ 63.0\n\nSo G_alpha is larger, which would mean lower probability. But alpha decay is more common. This seems contradictory. Therefore, maybe the Q-value for proton emission is actually negative in most cases, making it impossible. So even though the Coulomb barrier for proton emission is lower, if the Q-value is negative, the decay can't happen. Whereas for alpha decay, the Q-value is positive because the alpha particle is so tightly bound. So part (a) is that alpha decay has a positive Q-value (energy release) more often than other emissions. For example, emitting a proton would require the parent mass to be greater than daughter mass plus proton mass, but due to the lower binding energy of the daughter after losing a proton, this is less likely. Whereas emitting an alpha particle, which is very stable, allows the daughter to be more stable, leading to a positive Q-value. So even though the Coulomb barrier is higher for alpha decay, the fact that the Q-value is positive makes it possible, whereas for other emissions, the Q-value is often negative. Therefore, energy release (Q-value) being positive is a necessary condition, and alpha decay meets that more often. Then, even with a higher Coulomb barrier, the tunneling probability is non-zero because the Q-value is positive, whereas for other emissions, even if the barrier is lower, the Q-value is negative, so they can't occur. So part (a) is about the energy release being positive (exothermic) for alpha decay, and part (b) is that even though the Coulomb barrier is higher for alpha decay compared to, say, proton emission, the fact that the Q-value is positive allows tunneling, whereas for other emissions, the Q-value is often negative, making them impossible. Additionally, compared to fission, alpha decay has a lower Coulomb barrier because the alpha particle is smaller and the separation is easier. Fission involves splitting into two larger fragments, which have higher charges, leading to a higher Coulomb barrier. So even though fission might release more energy, the Coulomb barrier is much higher, making alpha decay more probable. Wait, but the question says \"why alpha-decay favored over other modes like fission\". So for fission, the Coulomb barrier is higher because the two fragments are larger and have higher charges. The product Z1*Z2 would be much larger for fission fragments (e.g., Z around 40-60 each) compared to alpha decay (Z1=Z-2, Z2=2). So the Coulomb barrier for fission is higher, making tunneling less probable despite higher energy release. Therefore, alpha decay is favored over fission because even though fission may release more energy (higher Q-value), the Coulomb barrier is so high that the probability is lower. But wait, in some heavy nuclei, fission does occur, but alpha decay is more common. So the combination of energy release and barrier penetration makes alpha decay more favorable. So putting it all together:\n\n(a) Alpha decay releases a significant amount of energy (positive Q-value) due to the high binding energy of the alpha particle, making it energetically favorable compared to other emissions which may not have positive Q-values.\n\n(b) Although the Coulomb barrier for alpha decay is higher than for lighter particles like protons, the higher Q-value allows sufficient tunneling probability. Compared to fission, the Coulomb barrier for alpha decay is lower because the alpha particle has a smaller charge, leading to a higher probability of tunneling despite the energy released in fission being potentially larger.\n</think>\n\n(a) **Energy Release**: Alpha decay is favored because the alpha particle (helium-4 nucleus) has an exceptionally high binding energy per nucleon. This results in a positive Q-value (energy release) for alpha decay in heavy nuclei, as the mass of the parent nucleus exceeds the combined mass of the daughter nucleus and the alpha particle. In contrast, emissions like protons, deuterons, or tritons often result in negative Q-values due to the lower binding energy of these particles and the reduced stability of the daughter nucleus. Thus, alpha decay is energetically viable where other modes are not.\n\n(b) **Coulomb Barrier**: The probability of tunneling through the Coulomb barrier depends on both the barrier height and the energy of the emitted particle. While the Coulomb barrier for alpha decay (proportional to \\( Z_{\\text{daughter}} \\cdot Z_{\\alpha} \\)) is higher than for lighter particles like protons, the significantly larger Q-value of alpha decay compensates by reducing the effective barrier width. Compared to fission, alpha decay involves a much smaller charge product (\\( Z_{\\text{daughter}} \\cdot Z_{\\alpha} \\ll Z_{\\text{fragment1}} \\cdot Z_{\\text{fragment2}} \\)), leading to a lower Coulomb barrier. Although fission may release more energy, the higher barrier makes tunneling less probable, favoring alpha decay.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a) Higher energy release (positive Q-value) due to alpha particle's binding energy.} \\\\\n\\text{(b) Lower effective Coulomb barrier compared to fission, enabling viable tunneling probability.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a) Higher energy release (positive Q-value) due to alpha particle's binding energy.} \\\\\n\\text{(b) Lower effective Coulomb barrier compared to fission, enabling viable tunneling probability.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a) Higher energy release (positive Q-value) due to alpha particle's binding energy.} \\\\\n\\text{(b) Lower effective Coulomb barrier compared to fission, enabling viable tunneling probability.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{Energy release factor: }\\alpha\\text{-decay energies } > 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-13", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to derive the Thomas-Fermi equation for the electrostatic potential in an atom. The problem is broken into three parts: (a) relating the potential φ to the Fermi momentum p_F, (b) connecting charge density ρ to φ, and (c) plugging that into Poisson's equation. Let me tackle each part step by step.\n\nStarting with part (a). The question says that the charge cloud adjusts until electrons at the Fermi sphere have zero energy. Hmm. So, electrons in the Fermi sphere have the highest energy, and here their energy is zero. The total energy of an electron should be the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy. So, the Fermi energy E_F would be the kinetic energy plus the potential energy. But since they have zero energy, that gives an equation.\n\nWait, the Fermi momentum p_F is related to the kinetic energy. For a non-relativistic electron, kinetic energy is p_F²/(2m), right? And the potential energy would be -eφ, because the electric potential energy is charge times potential. But electrons have charge -e, so maybe it's -eφ. But wait, in the Thomas-Fermi model, the potential φ is due to both the nucleus and the electron cloud. So, the total potential energy for an electron would be -eφ(r), since φ is the electrostatic potential from the nucleus and the electrons.\n\nSo, setting the total energy (kinetic + potential) to zero for the Fermi level electrons: p_F²/(2m) - eφ(r) = 0. Therefore, p_F²/(2m) = eφ(r). So, solving for p_F, we get p_F = sqrt(2meφ(r)). That seems like the relation between φ and p_F. Let me check units. Kinetic energy is in joules, eφ should also be in joules (since e is charge in coulombs, φ is volts, and coulomb-volt is joule). So yes, units check out. So part (a) gives p_F squared proportional to φ. So the answer for part (a) is p_F = sqrt(2meφ). Wait, but maybe there's a sign. If φ is positive, then p_F is real. But in an atom, the nucleus is positive, and electrons are in a negative potential? Wait, maybe I need to be careful with signs.\n\nWait, the potential φ here is the electrostatic potential experienced by the electrons. The nucleus is positive, so the potential from the nucleus is positive, but the electrons themselves contribute a negative potential. So the total φ would be the sum: φ = φ_nucleus + φ_electrons. The nucleus is a point charge Ze, so φ_nucleus is positive, and φ_electrons is negative. But in the Thomas-Fermi model, φ is the total potential. So when the electron is in this potential, its potential energy is -eφ. So if φ is positive, the potential energy is negative. But the kinetic energy is positive. So setting their sum to zero: KE + PE = 0. So KE = -PE. So p_F²/(2m) = eφ. So that's the same as before. So the relation is p_F = sqrt(2meφ). That seems right. So part (a) done.\n\nMoving to part (b): Use the relation from (a) to get ρ in terms of φ. Charge density ρ is the charge per unit volume from electrons. Since electrons are fermions, their density is related to the Fermi momentum. In the ground state, electrons fill up all states up to p_F. The number density of electrons n is given by the integral over momentum space up to p_F. For a free electron gas in 3D, the number density is (1/(3π²ħ³)) p_F³. Wait, the formula is n = (p_F³)/(3π²ħ³). But since each electron has charge -e, the charge density ρ is -e n. So ρ = -e (p_F³)/(3π²ħ³). But from part (a), p_F = sqrt(2meφ). So substitute that into ρ.\n\nSo ρ = -e/(3π²ħ³) * (2meφ)^(3/2). Let me compute that. (2meφ)^(3/2) is (2me)^(3/2) φ^(3/2). So ρ = -e (2me)^(3/2) / (3π²ħ³) * φ^(3/2). Let me check the constants. Let's see: 2me is 2m times e, but wait, in the expression for p_F, it's sqrt(2meφ). So when we cube p_F, we get (2meφ)^(3/2). So yes, that's correct. So the charge density ρ is proportional to φ^(3/2). So the algebraic relation is ρ = - (e (2me)^(3/2))/(3π²ħ³) * φ^(3/2). Maybe we can write this as ρ = -C φ^(3/2), where C is a constant. But the exact expression is important here. Let me compute the constants step by step.\n\nFirst, e is the elementary charge, m is the electron mass. So (2me) is 2m e. Then (2me)^(3/2) is (2m e)^(3/2) = 2^(3/2) m^(3/2) e^(3/2). Then divided by 3π²ħ³. So putting it all together:\n\nρ = -e * [ (2me)^(3/2) / (3π²ħ³) ] * φ^(3/2)\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\nLet me factor out the constants. Let's compute the coefficient:\n\nCoefficient = -e * (2me)^(3/2) / (3π²ħ³)\n\n= -e * (2^(3/2) m^(3/2) e^(3/2)) / (3π²ħ³)\n\n= - (2^(3/2) m^(3/2) e^(5/2)) / (3π²ħ³)\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as:\n\n= - ( (2m e)^(3/2) e ) / (3π²ħ³ )\n\nBut perhaps there's a standard way to write this. Alternatively, using ħ instead of h. Wait, ħ is h/(2π). So if the original formula for n is (p_F^3)/(3π²ħ³), then yes, because in 3D, the number density is (1/( (2πħ)^3 )) * (4π/3) p_F^3 ), which is (4π p_F^3)/(3*(2πħ)^3)) = (p_F^3)/(6 π² ħ³). Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the formula for the number density in a Fermi gas.\n\nIn three dimensions, the number density n is given by the integral over all momentum up to p_F of the density of states. The density of states in momentum space is (V/( (2πħ)^3 )) * 2 (for spin). So the total number of electrons is N = 2 * V/( (2πħ)^3 ) * (4π/3) p_F^3 ). Therefore, the number density n = N/V = (8π p_F^3)/(3*(2πħ)^3)) = (8π p_F^3)/(3*8 π³ ħ³)) = (p_F^3)/(3 π² ħ³). Yes, that's correct. So n = p_F^3/(3 π² ħ³). Therefore, ρ = -e n = -e p_F^3/(3 π² ħ³). Then substituting p_F from part (a): p_F = sqrt(2 m e φ). So p_F^3 = (2 m e φ)^(3/2). Therefore, ρ = -e (2 m e φ)^(3/2)/(3 π² ħ³). So expanding that, ρ = -e (2 m e)^(3/2) φ^(3/2)/(3 π² ħ³). So that's the relation between ρ and φ. So part (b) is done.\n\nNow part (c): Insert this into Poisson's equation. Poisson's equation is ∇²φ = -ρ/(ε₀). Wait, but wait: the potential φ is due to both the nucleus and the electrons. Wait, in electrostatics, Poisson's equation is ∇²φ = -ρ_total/ε₀, where ρ_total is the total charge density. But in the Thomas-Fermi model, the potential φ is created by both the nucleus and the electrons. So the charge density ρ_total is the sum of the nuclear charge density and the electron charge density. The nucleus is a point charge at the origin, so its charge density is Ze δ³(r). The electron charge density is ρ(r) as derived in part (b). So ρ_total = Ze δ³(r) + ρ(r). But in the Thomas-Fermi model, the electrons are considered as a continuous distribution, so the nuclear charge is treated as a delta function. Therefore, Poisson's equation becomes:\n\n∇²φ = - (Ze δ³(r) + ρ(r)) / ε₀\n\nBut from part (b), ρ(r) is expressed in terms of φ(r). So substituting ρ(r) from part (b):\n\n∇²φ = - [ Ze δ³(r) - (e (2 m e)^(3/2) φ^(3/2)/(3 π² ħ³)) ] / ε₀\n\nWait, but ρ(r) is negative, as electrons are negative. So substituting ρ(r) = - (e (2 m e)^(3/2) φ^(3/2)/(3 π² ħ³)), so:\n\n∇²φ = - [ Ze δ³(r) + (- e (2 m e)^(3/2) φ^(3/2)/(3 π² ħ³)) ] / ε₀\n\nSimplify:\n\n∇²φ = - Ze δ³(r)/ε₀ + [ e (2 m e)^(3/2) φ^(3/2)/(3 π² ħ³ ε₀) ]\n\nBut in the Thomas-Fermi equation, they usually write it in terms of a screened potential. However, the delta function term is only relevant at the origin (nucleus), and for r > 0, the equation becomes:\n\n∇²φ = [ e (2 m e)^(3/2) φ^(3/2) ] / (3 π² ħ³ ε₀ )\n\nBut this seems a bit messy. Let me see if I can simplify the constants. Let's compute the coefficient in front of φ^(3/2).\n\nCoefficient = e (2 m e)^(3/2) / (3 π² ħ³ ε₀ )\n\nFirst, let's write (2 m e)^(3/2) = 2^(3/2) m^(3/2) e^(3/2). Then:\n\nCoefficient = e * 2^(3/2) m^(3/2) e^(3/2) / (3 π² ħ³ ε₀ )\n\nCombine the e terms: e^(1 + 3/2) = e^(5/2). So:\n\nCoefficient = 2^(3/2) m^(3/2) e^(5/2) / (3 π² ħ³ ε₀ )\n\nThis is a constant. Let me see if this can be expressed in terms of the Bohr radius or other constants. Alternatively, perhaps we can define a dimensionless function and scale variables to make the equation dimensionless, which is common in Thomas-Fermi theory. But the problem just asks to insert into Poisson's equation to get a nonlinear PDE. So the final equation is:\n\n∇²φ(r) = - Ze δ³(r)/ε₀ + [ (2^(3/2) m^(3/2) e^(5/2) ) / (3 π² ħ³ ε₀ ) ] φ(r)^(3/2)\n\nBut usually, the Thomas-Fermi equation is written without the delta function, considering the region away from the nucleus. However, including the nuclear charge, the full equation would have the delta function. However, in practice, when solving the Thomas-Fermi equation, one often considers the screening of the nuclear charge by electrons, and the equation is considered in the region r > 0 with boundary conditions accounting for the nuclear charge. Alternatively, the equation can be written in terms of a screening function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write the equation as:\n\n∇²φ = (1/(ε₀)) [ - Ze δ³(r) + (e (2 m e)^(3/2) φ^(3/2))/(3 π² ħ³) ]\n\nBut this is a nonlinear PDE because of the φ^(3/2) term. So the final equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation involving the Laplacian of φ and φ^(3/2), plus the delta function for the nucleus. However, in many treatments, the delta function is handled via boundary conditions. For example, at r → 0, the potential approaches the nuclear potential, so φ(r) ≈ Ze/(4πε₀ r). Then, for r > 0, the equation is:\n\n∇²φ = (e (2 m e)^(3/2) )/(3 π² ħ³ ε₀ ) φ^(3/2)\n\nBut to make this cleaner, let's define a constant γ = (e (2 m e)^(3/2) )/(3 π² ħ³ ε₀ ). Then the equation becomes ∇²φ = γ φ^(3/2) for r > 0, with the boundary condition from the nucleus. However, the problem says to insert into Poisson's equation to obtain the PDE. So the answer should be the Poisson equation with the charge density from part (b) and the nuclear charge. So the final equation is:\n\n∇²φ = [ - Ze δ³(r) + ρ ] / ε₀\n\nBut ρ is given by part (b), so substituting:\n\n∇²φ = [ - Ze δ³(r) - (e (2 m e)^(3/2) φ^(3/2)/(3 π² ħ³ )) ] / ε₀\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n∇²φ = - (Ze δ³(r))/ε₀ - (e (2 m e)^(3/2) φ^(3/2))/(3 π² ħ³ ε₀ )\n\nBut typically, the Thomas-Fermi equation is written without the delta function, considering the electron contribution and the nuclear charge through boundary conditions. However, strictly speaking, the delta function is part of the charge density. So the full PDE is as above. However, in many references, the equation is written for the region outside the nucleus, so the delta function is replaced by a boundary condition at r=0 where the potential behaves like Ze/(4πε₀ r). Then, the equation becomes:\n\n∇²φ = (e (2 m e)^(3/2))/(3 π² ħ³ ε₀ ) φ^(3/2)\n\nBut the coefficient can be simplified. Let me compute the numerical factors:\n\nLet me compute the coefficient:\n\n( e (2 m e)^{3/2} ) / (3 π² ħ^3 ε₀ )\n\n= e * (2^{3/2} m^{3/2} e^{3/2}) / (3 π² ħ^3 ε₀ )\n\n= 2^{3/2} e^{5/2} m^{3/2} / (3 π² ħ^3 ε₀ )\n\nBut perhaps we can express this in terms of the Bohr radius a_0 = (4 π ε₀ ħ²)/(m e²). Let's see:\n\nLet me compute 1/a_0^3:\n\na_0 = 4 π ε₀ ħ²/(m e²), so a_0^3 = (4 π ε₀ ħ²/(m e²))^3. Therefore, 1/a_0^3 = (m e²)^3/( (4 π ε₀)^3 ħ^6 )\n\nBut maybe this is not helpful. Alternatively, let's see:\n\nThe coefficient in front of φ^(3/2) is:\n\n(2^{3/2} e^{5/2} m^{3/2}) / (3 π² ħ^3 ε₀ )\n\nLet me factor out e²/(4 π ε₀), which is similar to Coulomb's constant.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to just leave it as is. The key point is that the resulting equation is a nonlinear PDE:\n\n∇²φ(r) = (constant) φ(r)^{3/2} - (Ze/ε₀) δ³(r)\n\nBut in practice, the delta function is accounted for by the boundary condition that as r approaches 0, φ(r) approaches the nuclear potential Ze/(4 π ε₀ r). So for r > 0, the equation is:\n\n∇²φ = (constant) φ^{3/2}\n\nThis is the Thomas-Fermi equation. To write it more neatly, let's substitute the constant. Let me compute the constant again:\n\nConstant C = (2^{3/2} e^{5/2} m^{3/2}) / (3 π² ħ^3 ε₀ )\n\nBut perhaps we can write this as:\n\nC = ( (2 m e)^{3/2} e ) / (3 π² ħ^3 ε₀ )\n\nAlternatively, using ħ = h/(2π), so ħ^3 = h^3/(8 π^3). Substituting:\n\nC = ( (2 m e)^{3/2} e ) / (3 π² (h^3/(8 π^3)) ε₀ )\n\n= ( (2 m e)^{3/2} e * 8 π^3 ) / (3 π² h^3 ε₀ )\n\n= ( (2 m e)^{3/2} e * 8 π ) / (3 h^3 ε₀ )\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps. Alternatively, using the definition of the Bohr radius a_0 = (4 π ε₀ ħ²)/(m e²), we can express some terms in terms of a_0. Let's try:\n\nLet me express ħ^2/(m e²) = (4 π ε₀ a_0)/ (m e²) * m e²/(4 π ε₀) ) Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, solving for ε₀ from a_0:\n\na_0 = 4 π ε₀ ħ²/(m e²) → ε₀ = a_0 m e²/(4 π ħ²)\n\nSubstituting ε₀ into the constant C:\n\nC = (2^{3/2} e^{5/2} m^{3/2}) / (3 π² ħ^3 * (a_0 m e²/(4 π ħ²)) )\n\n= (2^{3/2} e^{5/2} m^{3/2} * 4 π ħ² ) / (3 π² ħ^3 a_0 m e² )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 2^{3/2} * 4 π * e^{5/2} m^{3/2} ħ²\n\nDenominator: 3 π² ħ^3 a_0 m e²\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (2^{3/2} * 4 π e^{5/2} m^{3/2} ħ² ) / (3 π² ħ^3 a_0 m e² )\n\nCancel m terms: m^{3/2}/m = m^{1/2}\n\nCancel e terms: e^{5/2}/e² = e^{1/2}\n\nCancel ħ terms: ħ²/ħ^3 = 1/ħ\n\nCancel π terms: π/π² = 1/π\n\nSo:\n\n= (2^{3/2} * 4 * e^{1/2} m^{1/2} ) / (3 π ħ a_0 )\n\nBut 2^{3/2} *4 = 4 * 2^{3/2} = 4 * 2 * sqrt(2) = 8 sqrt(2)\n\nWait, 2^{3/2} is 2*sqrt(2), so 2^{3/2}*4 = 4*2*sqrt(2) = 8 sqrt(2)\n\nSo:\n\n= (8 sqrt(2) e^{1/2} m^{1/2} ) / (3 π ħ a_0 )\n\nBut e^{1/2} is sqrt(e), m^{1/2} is sqrt(m). So:\n\n= (8 sqrt(2) sqrt(e m) ) / (3 π ħ a_0 )\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, using the definition of a_0, we can write sqrt(e m) in terms of a_0 and ħ. But this might not lead to a simplification. Perhaps it's best to leave the constant as it is. So the final PDE is:\n\n∇²φ = (2^{3/2} e^{5/2} m^{3/2} )/(3 π² ħ³ ε₀ ) φ^{3/2} - (Ze/ε₀) δ³(r)\n\nBut in most references, the Thomas-Fermi equation is written in terms of a dimensionless function. For example, by making a substitution like φ(r) = (Ze/(4π ε₀ r)) χ(r/a), where a is some scaling length, and χ is a dimensionless function. Then the equation can be transformed into a dimensionless form. However, the problem doesn't ask for that; it just asks to insert into Poisson's equation to get the PDE. So the answer is the Poisson equation with the charge density from part (b) and the nuclear charge, leading to the nonlinear PDE as above.\n\nAlternatively, if we ignore the delta function (considering r > 0), then the equation is:\n\n∇²φ = (constant) φ^{3/2}\n\nBut to write it explicitly, the final answer for part (c) is the equation:\n\n∇²φ(r) = \\frac{e (2 m e)^{3/2}}{3 \\pi^2 \\hbar^3 \\epsilon_0} \\phi(r)^{3/2} - \\frac{Ze}{\\epsilon_0} \\delta^3(r)\n\nBut usually, the Thomas-Fermi equation is presented without the delta function term, with the understanding that the boundary condition at r=0 accounts for the nuclear charge. However, since the problem says to insert into Poisson's equation, which includes all charge densities, the delta function should be included. However, in practice, when solving the equation, the delta function is handled via the boundary condition. So perhaps the answer is:\n\n∇²φ = \\frac{ (2m)^{3/2} e^{5/2} }{ 3 \\pi^2 \\hbar^3 \\epsilon_0 } \\phi^{3/2} - \\frac{Ze}{\\epsilon_0} \\delta^3(\\mathbf{r})\n\nBut I need to check the constants again. Let me recompute the coefficient:\n\nFrom part (b), ρ = -e (2me)^{3/2}/(3 π² ħ³) φ^{3/2}\n\nThen substituting into Poisson's equation:\n\n∇²φ = - (ρ + Ze δ³(r)) / ε₀\n\nWait, Poisson's equation is ∇²φ = - (ρ_total)/ε₀, where ρ_total is the sum of the nuclear charge density (Ze δ³(r)) and the electron charge density (ρ). So:\n\n∇²φ = - [ Ze δ³(r) + ρ ] / ε₀\n\nBut ρ is negative, so:\n\n∇²φ = - [ Ze δ³(r) - |ρ| ] / ε₀ = [ |ρ| - Ze δ³(r) ] / ε₀\n\nBut substituting ρ from part (b):\n\n|ρ| = e (2me)^{3/2}/(3 π² ħ³) φ^{3/2}\n\nTherefore:\n\n∇²φ = [ e (2me)^{3/2}/(3 π² ħ³) φ^{3/2} - Ze δ³(r) ] / ε₀\n\nSo:\n\n∇²φ = \\frac{ e (2me)^{3/2} }{ 3 \\pi^2 \\hbar^3 \\epsilon_0 } \\phi^{3/2} - \\frac{Ze}{\\epsilon_0} \\delta^3(\\mathbf{r})\n\nYes, that's correct. So this is the nonlinear PDE for φ. The presence of the delta function accounts for the nucleus, and the φ^{3/2} term comes from the electron charge density. This is the Thomas-Fermi equation. However, in many formulations, the equation is written in terms of a screening function, and the delta function is replaced by a boundary condition. But according to the problem statement, inserting into Poisson's equation gives this result. So this is the final answer for part (c).\n</think>\n\n(a) The energy of an electron at the Fermi level is the sum of its kinetic and potential energies. Setting this total energy to zero gives:\n\\[\n\\frac{p_F^2}{2m} - e\\phi = 0 \\implies p_F = \\sqrt{2me\\phi}.\n\\]\nThus, the relation is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{p_F = \\sqrt{2me\\phi}}.\n\\]\n\n(b) The charge density \\(\\rho\\) is related to the electron number density \\(n\\), which for a Fermi gas in 3D is \\(n = \\frac{p_F^3}{3\\pi^2\\hbar^3}\\).

{"id": "atomic/2-34", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to explain why alpha particle emission is common in heavy nuclei, but proton radioactivity is almost nonexistent. Hmm. Let me start by recalling what I know about nuclear stability and decay processes.\n\nFirst, alpha particles are helium-4 nuclei, which consist of two protons and two neutrons. Proton emission would just be a single proton leaving the nucleus. Both processes involve the nucleus getting rid of some particles to become more stable. But why is alpha emission more common?\n\nI remember that the stability of a nucleus is related to the binding energy. The semi-empirical mass formula (Bethe-Weizsäcker formula) gives the binding energy based on various terms: volume, surface, Coulomb, asymmetry, and pairing. Maybe comparing the energy released in alpha decay versus proton emission would help.\n\nFor alpha decay, the parent nucleus emits an alpha particle, so the daughter nucleus has an atomic number Z-2 and mass number A-4. The energy released (Q-value) must be positive for the decay to be spontaneous. The Q-value depends on the mass difference between the parent and daughter plus the alpha particle. Since the alpha particle is very tightly bound (high binding energy), the mass deficit might be enough to make Q positive for heavy nuclei.\n\nProton emission, on the other hand, would result in a daughter nucleus with Z-1 and A-1. The Q-value here would be the mass difference between the parent and daughter plus a proton. But protons are less tightly bound compared to alpha particles. Also, the Coulomb barrier plays a role. The alpha particle, being doubly charged, has a higher Coulomb barrier, but maybe the higher binding energy and lower potential energy after emission make it more favorable.\n\nWait, but the Coulomb barrier for emission depends on the charges involved. The potential barrier height is proportional to (Z_daughter * Z_emitted particle)/(r), where r is the radius where the emission happens. For alpha decay, Z_emitted is 2, and Z_daughter is Z-2. For proton emission, Z_emitted is 1, and Z_daughter is Z-1. So the Coulomb barrier for alpha is higher, but tunneling probability depends on the product of charges and the energy of the emitted particle.\n\nThe tunneling probability is given by the Gamow factor, which is exponential in the square root of the product of charges and the inverse square root of the energy. So even though the Coulomb barrier is higher for alpha, the alpha particle might have a higher energy (due to larger Q-value) which could make the tunneling probability non-negligible. For proton emission, if the Q-value is lower, the tunneling probability might be too small, making the half-life extremely long, hence not observed.\n\nAlso, the binding energy of the alpha particle is about 28 MeV, which is much higher than that of a single proton. So when a nucleus emits an alpha, it loses more mass, leading to a higher Q-value. For proton emission, the Q-value might be lower or even negative in many cases, making it energetically unfavorable.\n\nAnother point is the pairing energy. Alpha particles have even numbers of protons and neutrons, which might be more favorable due to pairing effects. Nuclei with even Z and N are generally more stable. So emitting an alpha (which has even Z and N) might preserve some pairing energy benefits in the daughter nucleus. Whereas emitting a proton would leave an odd Z, which is less stable.\n\nAlso, the liquid drop model: heavy nuclei have higher surface area and Coulomb repulsion. Emitting a larger chunk like an alpha particle reduces the Coulomb energy more effectively than emitting a single proton. The surface energy term might also be more favorable for alpha emission since removing four nucleons (two protons and two neutrons) reduces the surface tension less than removing one proton. Wait, actually, surface energy is proportional to the surface area, so removing four nucleons would decrease the radius more, but maybe the volume term is more significant. Hmm, not sure about that.\n\nLet me think about the semi-empirical formula. The binding energy B is given by:\n\nB = a_V*A - a_S*A^(2/3) - a_C*Z²/A^(1/3) - a_A*(A-2Z)²/A + delta/a_P\n\nFor alpha decay, the change in binding energy would be the difference between the daughter + alpha and the parent. Since the alpha is very tightly bound, the mass of the parent is greater than the sum of the daughter and alpha, leading to a positive Q-value. For proton emission, the daughter plus proton's mass must be less than the parent's mass. But protons are less tightly bound, so this is less likely unless the parent is very proton-rich.\n\nHeavy nuclei tend to have a lot of protons, so the Coulomb repulsion is high. Emitting two protons (as in alpha) would reduce the Coulomb term more than emitting one. But why not emit two protons? Because without neutrons, the two protons would have a harder time staying together. The alpha particle, with two neutrons and two protons, is a stable configuration. So emitting a group with a better binding energy per nucleon is more favorable.\n\nSo, in summary, the main reasons are:\n\n1. Higher binding energy of the alpha particle leads to a more favorable Q-value for alpha decay compared to proton emission.\n\n2. The reduction in Coulomb repulsion is more significant when emitting a higher charge (alpha) than a single proton, making alpha decay more energetically favorable in heavy nuclei with high Z.\n\n3. The tunneling probability through the Coulomb barrier, while lower for alpha due to higher charge, is compensated by a higher Q-value, leading to a feasible decay rate. Proton emission would have a lower Q-value and thus a much lower tunneling probability, making the half-life too long to observe.\n\n4. Pairing effects favor the emission of an even number of protons and neutrons, as in the alpha particle, leading to a more stable daughter nucleus.\n\nTherefore, proton radioactivity is rare because it's less energetically favorable, has a lower Q-value (if any), and the tunneling probability is too small for practical observation, except in extremely proton-rich nuclei where it might occur but such nuclei are not commonly found or are very short-lived due to other decay modes.\n</think>\n\nThe striking difference between the prevalence of α-particle emission and proton radioactivity in heavy nuclei can be explained through several quantitative arguments rooted in nuclear binding energy, Coulomb interactions, and quantum tunneling probabilities:\n\n1. **Q-Value and Binding Energy**:  \n   The energy released (Q-value) in α-decay is typically positive for heavy nuclei due to the high binding energy of the α-particle (~28 MeV). The α-particle’s stability arises from its even proton-neutron pairing, reducing the daughter nucleus’s Coulomb energy significantly (ΔZ = -2). In contrast, proton emission requires the daughter nucleus (Z-1, A-1) to have a lower mass than the parent plus a free proton. Since protons are less tightly bound, this condition is rarely met except in extremely proton-rich nuclei.\n\n2. **Coulomb Barrier and Tunneling**:  \n   The tunneling probability through the Coulomb barrier depends on the Gamow factor:  \n   \\[\n   P \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{Z_{\\text{daughter}} Z_{\\text{emitted}} e^2}{\\hbar \\epsilon}}\\right),\n   \\]  \n   where \\(\\epsilon\\) is the kinetic energy of the emitted particle. For α-decay (\\(Z_{\\text{emitted}} = 2\\)), the higher Q-value (\\(\\epsilon \\sim 4–9\\) MeV) compensates for the larger Coulomb barrier (\\(Z_{\\text{daughter}} \\sim Z-2\\)), enabling measurable decay rates. Proton emission (\\(Z_{\\text{emitted}} = 1\\)) faces a lower barrier but typically has much smaller Q-values (\\(\\epsilon \\lesssim 1\\) MeV), leading to negligible tunneling probabilities and half-lives exceeding observational timescales.\n\n3. **Reduction in Coulomb Repulsion**:  \n   Heavy nuclei (high Z) experience significant Coulomb repulsion. Emitting an α-particle (ΔZ = -2) reduces the Coulomb energy term in the semi-empirical mass formula by \\(\\Delta E_C \\propto Z^2/A^{1/3} - (Z-2)^2/(A-4)^{1/3}\\), which is more substantial than the reduction from proton emission (ΔZ = -1). This makes α-decay energetically favorable.\n\n4. **Pairing Effects**:  \n   The α-particle’s even-even configuration aligns with pairing energy gains in the parent nucleus. Emitting an α-particle preserves stability in the daughter nucleus, whereas proton emission leaves an odd-Z nucleus, which is less stable due to unpaired protons.\n\n**Conclusion**: α-decay dominates in heavy nuclei due to favorable Q-values, significant Coulomb energy reduction, and viable tunneling probabilities. Proton radioactivity is rare because it requires extreme proton excess, has low Q-values, and faces prohibitive tunneling barriers. Thus, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{α-decay is favored due to higher Q-values, reduced Coulomb repulsion, and viable tunneling probabilities, while proton emission is suppressed by low Q-values and negligible tunneling rates.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{α-decay is favored due to higher Q-values, reduced Coulomb repulsion, and viable tunneling probabilities, while proton emission is suppressed by low Q-values and negligible tunneling rates.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{α-decay is favored due to higher Q-values, reduced Coulomb repulsion, and viable tunneling probabilities, while proton emission is suppressed by low Q-values and negligible tunneling rates.}", "expr2": "E_d > 0 \\text{ for } \\alpha\\text{-decay (for } A \\geq 150\\text{); } -\\varepsilon < 0 \\text{ for proton-decay}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/4-48", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The problem is about the decay of a charmed meson D⁰ into K⁻ and π⁺. We need to find the momentum of the K-meson in the rest frame of the D⁰. The given masses are D⁰ = 1.8 GeV/c², K⁻ = 0.5 GeV/c², and π⁺ = 0.15 GeV/c². \n\nHmm, right. Since the D⁰ is at rest, the total momentum of the decay products should be zero. That means the K⁻ and π⁺ must have equal and opposite momenta. So their magnitudes should be the same. To find the momentum, I think we can use conservation of energy and momentum here. But since the parent particle is at rest, maybe we can use the formula for two-body decay kinematics. \n\nI remember there's a formula for the momentum of decay products in the rest frame of the parent particle. The formula is p = sqrt( [ (M² - (m1 + m2)²)(M² - (m1 - m2)²) ] ) / (2M) ), where M is the mass of the parent, and m1 and m2 are the masses of the decay products. Let me check if that's correct. \n\nYes, that seems right. Let me plug in the numbers. M is 1.8 GeV/c², m1 is 0.5 GeV/c² (K⁻), and m2 is 0.15 GeV/c² (π⁺). \n\nFirst, compute (M² - (m1 + m2)²). Let's calculate m1 + m2: 0.5 + 0.15 = 0.65 GeV/c². Then (1.8)^2 - (0.65)^2. Let's compute 1.8 squared: 3.24. 0.65 squared is 0.4225. So 3.24 - 0.4225 = 2.8175 (GeV²/c⁴). \n\nNext term is (M² - (m1 - m2)²). m1 - m2 is 0.5 - 0.15 = 0.35 GeV/c². Squared is 0.1225. So 3.24 - 0.1225 = 3.1175 GeV²/c⁴. \n\nMultiply those two terms: 2.8175 * 3.1175. Let me compute that. 2.8175 * 3 = 8.4525, and 2.8175 * 0.1175 ≈ 0.331. So total is approximately 8.4525 + 0.331 ≈ 8.7835. Then take the square root of that. sqrt(8.7835) ≈ 2.963 GeV²/c⁴. Wait, but the square root of 8.7835 is approximately 2.963 GeV/c². \n\nThen divide by (2M) which is 2 * 1.8 = 3.6 GeV/c². So p ≈ 2.963 / 3.6 ≈ 0.823 GeV/c. \n\nWait, let me check the units. The formula gives p in GeV/c, right? Because the numerator is sqrt(GeV²/c⁴ * GeV²/c⁴) under the square root, which would be GeV²/c⁴, then sqrt gives GeV/c². Wait, no. Wait, the formula is sqrt( (M² - (m1 + m2)^2)(M² - (m1 - m2)^2) ) which is sqrt( (GeV²/c⁴ - GeV²/c⁴)(...) ) so each term inside is GeV²/c⁴. Then the product is (GeV^4/c^8), square root gives GeV²/c^4. Then divided by 2M (GeV/c²), so overall units would be (GeV²/c^4) / (GeV/c²) ) = GeV/c² * 1/c²? Wait, maybe I messed up the units here. Wait, perhaps better to just rely on the numerical calculation. Since all masses are in GeV/c², then the formula gives p in GeV/c. Because when you compute the numerator, sqrt( (GeV²/c⁴)^2 ) is GeV²/c⁴, then sqrt is GeV/c². Then divided by 2M (GeV/c²), so GeV/c² divided by GeV/c² gives unitless? Wait, that can't be. Hmm, maybe I need to check the formula again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using energy conservation. The total energy of the system is the mass of D⁰, which is 1.8 GeV. The energies of K and π should add up to 1.8 GeV. Also, their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let me denote the magnitude of momentum as p. Then the energy of K is sqrt( (p)^2 c^2 + (m_K c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, units can be confusing. Let me think in natural units where c=1. Then energy is sqrt(p² + m²). So in natural units, the energy of K is sqrt(p² + m_K²) and similarly for the pion. Then total energy is sqrt(p² + 0.5²) + sqrt(p² + 0.15²) = 1.8. \n\nSo we can set up the equation: sqrt(p² + 0.25) + sqrt(p² + 0.0225) = 1.8. Then solve for p. \n\nThis might be a bit more involved, but perhaps more straightforward. Let me try this approach. Let me denote x = p. Then equation is sqrt(x² + 0.25) + sqrt(x² + 0.0225) = 1.8. Let me subtract one of the terms: sqrt(x² + 0.25) = 1.8 - sqrt(x² + 0.0225). Then square both sides: x² + 0.25 = (1.8)^2 - 2*1.8*sqrt(x² + 0.0225) + x² + 0.0225. \n\nSimplify: x² + 0.25 = 3.24 - 3.6 sqrt(x² + 0.0225) + x² + 0.0225. \n\nSubtract x² from both sides: 0.25 = 3.24 + 0.0225 - 3.6 sqrt(x² + 0.0225). \n\nCalculate 3.24 + 0.0225 = 3.2625. So 0.25 = 3.2625 - 3.6 sqrt(x² + 0.0225). \n\nRearranged: 3.6 sqrt(x² + 0.0225) = 3.2625 - 0.25 = 3.0125. \n\nDivide both sides by 3.6: sqrt(x² + 0.0225) = 3.0125 / 3.6 ≈ 0.8368. \n\nSquare both sides: x² + 0.0225 ≈ (0.8368)^2 ≈ 0.7003. \n\nSubtract 0.0225: x² ≈ 0.7003 - 0.0225 = 0.6778. \n\nTake square root: x ≈ sqrt(0.6778) ≈ 0.823 GeV/c. \n\nSo that's the same result as before. So the momentum of the K-meson is approximately 0.823 GeV/c. \n\nSo part (a) answer is approximately 0.823 GeV/c. \n\nNow part (b): The statement is \"The production of single K⁻ mesons by neutrinos (ν_μ) is evidence for D⁰ production.\" We need to determine if this is true or false and explain. \n\nHmm. Let's think. Neutrinos interact via the weak interaction. When a neutrino scatters off a target (say, a nucleus), it typically produces a charged lepton (like a muon in the case of ν_μ) and a hadronic system. The hadronic system can fragment into various particles. \n\nD⁰ mesons are charm mesons. Production of charm particles requires a charm quark. In neutrino interactions, the weak interaction can change the flavor. For example, a neutrino interacting with a down quark can produce a charm quark if there's enough energy. But charm production is higher energy because the charm quark is heavy (mass around 1.5 GeV). So, if the neutrino has enough energy to produce a charm quark, then a D⁰ (which contains a charm and anti-up quark) could be produced. \n\nNow, the decay of D⁰ is into K⁻ and π⁺. So if a D⁰ is produced and decays into K⁻ and π⁺, then you would see a K⁻ in the final state. However, can a K⁻ be produced without D⁰ production? \n\nAlternative ways to produce a K⁻: For example, associate production, or via strange quark production. But in neutrino interactions, the typical process is a charged current interaction where a quark is struck, and a lepton is produced. For example, ν_μ + d → μ⁻ + u (if no strange or charm involved). But to produce a K⁻ (which is s quark and u antiquark), you need to create an s quark and an anti-u. \n\nWait, K⁻ is composed of an anti-strange and a u quark? Wait no: K⁻ is s antiquark and u quark. Wait, no: K⁻ is composed of an anti-strange and a u antiquark? Wait, no. Let me recall: The K⁻ is composed of an anti-strange quark and a u antiquark. Wait, no. Wait, the quark content: K⁻ is s̄ u. Wait, no. Wait, K+ is u s̄. So K⁻ would be s ū. Wait, no. Let me check. The K⁻ is the antiparticle of the K⁺. The K⁺ is u s̄, so K⁻ is ū s. So to create a K⁻, you need an s quark and a ū antiquark. \n\nIn a neutrino interaction, say ν_μ interacts with a nucleus. The neutrino is a lepton, so the interaction is via W boson exchange. For a charged current interaction, the ν_μ turns into a muon, and the struck quark turns into another quark. For example, if the neutrino interacts with a down quark: ν_μ + d → μ⁻ + u. But if there's a strange quark in the target, ν_μ + s → μ⁻ + c. But if the target is a nucleus, the quarks are typically u and d. So to produce a K⁻, which is s and ū, you need to create an s quark and a ū antiquark. \n\nBut creating an s quark would require either it being present in the sea (which is possible, but strange quark content is lower than u, d), or produced via the interaction. However, in a normal charged current interaction without charm production, you can't produce an s quark unless you have a Cabibbo-suppressed process. Wait, the weak interaction couples d to s via the CKM matrix. The Cabibbo angle allows for transitions between d and s quarks. So, for example, the charged current interaction can couple u to d' = d cosθ + s sinθ. So when a neutrino interacts, the amplitude for producing a charm quark is suppressed by the CKM matrix element V_cd or V_cs. But if the energy is sufficient, producing a charm quark would require higher energy. \n\nWait, but if the neutrino has enough energy to produce a charm quark, then the interaction could produce a charm quark. For example, ν_μ + d → μ⁻ + c. Then the c quark would hadronize, possibly into a D meson like D⁰ (c ū), which then decays into K⁻ π⁺. \n\nAlternatively, if the interaction produces an s quark (without charm), then maybe via Cabibbo-suppressed processes. For example, ν_μ + s → μ⁻ + u. But s quarks are less common in the target. So producing a K⁻ might be possible through other mechanisms, but perhaps the dominant way to get a K⁻ in high-energy neutrino interactions is through charm production and subsequent decay. \n\nSo if a single K⁻ is observed, does that imply D⁰ production? Well, if the K⁻ is produced directly, without charm, then it's possible. But in standard model processes, producing a K⁻ would require either a strange quark in the target (unlikely in typical nuclei) or production via a Cabibbo-suppressed interaction. Alternatively, the K⁻ could come from the decay of a charm particle like D⁰. \n\nBut in neutrino interactions, if the energy is high enough to produce charm, then D⁰ production is possible. However, if the energy is below the charm production threshold, then producing a K⁻ would require other mechanisms, which might be Cabibbo-suppressed. \n\nTherefore, the production of a single K⁻ by neutrinos could be evidence for D⁰ production if the alternative mechanisms (non-charm) are unlikely. For example, if the neutrino energy is above the charm production threshold, and the K⁻ is accompanied by other particles (like π⁺), then it's more likely from D⁰ decay. But if the K⁻ is produced alone, maybe not. Wait, but in the decay of D⁰, you get K⁻ and π⁺. So if you see a K⁻ and a π⁺, that's a signature. But the question says \"single K⁻ mesons\". So if they observe a K⁻ without a π⁺, then maybe it's not from D⁰ decay. But if they see a K⁻ and a π⁺, that could be a D⁰ decay. \n\nBut the statement is about the production of single K⁻ mesons. So if neutrinos produce single K⁻ mesons, is that evidence for D⁰ production? \n\nAlternatively, if the K⁻ is produced in association with other particles, but the question is about single K⁻. Hmm. \n\nWait, in the decay of D⁰ → K⁻ + π⁺, you get both a K⁻ and a π⁺. So if you have a K⁻ and a π⁺ coming from the same vertex, that's a clear sign of D⁰ decay. But if you have a single K⁻ produced, maybe from some other process, then it's not necessarily from D⁰. \n\nBut the problem states \"production of single K⁻ mesons by neutrinos\". So if neutrinos are producing K⁻ mesons alone, without accompanying π⁺ (or other particles from D⁰ decay), then is that evidence for D⁰ production? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the production of a K⁻ requires a charm quark, hence D⁰ production. But if the K⁻ can be produced via other means (like associated production with a lambda particle or something), then it's not necessarily. \n\nBut in neutrino interactions, the typical way to produce a strange particle would be through charm production, because the Cabibbo-favored interaction is d → u, and Cabibbo-suppressed is s → u. So if the neutrino interacts with an s quark (which is rare in the target), you can get a u quark, but that's Cabibbo-suppressed. So the cross-section for that is lower. \n\nTherefore, if a single K⁻ is observed, and the neutrino has enough energy to produce charm, then the K⁻ is more likely to come from D⁰ decay (since the production via Cabibbo-suppressed processes is less likely). Hence, the observation of single K⁻ mesons would be evidence for D⁰ production. \n\nBut wait, in the decay D⁰ → K⁻ + π⁺, you don't get a single K⁻, you get a K⁻ and a π⁺. So if the experiment is detecting only the K⁻ and missing the π⁺ (maybe because it's neutral or not detected), then maybe. But the problem states \"single K⁻ mesons\", which might imply that only the K⁻ is observed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pion is not detected, but the K⁻ is. However, in that case, the presence of a K⁻ with certain momentum could be indicative of coming from a D⁰ decay. But if the K⁻ is produced directly, its momentum spectrum would be different. \n\nAlternatively, if the neutrino interaction produces a D⁰ which then decays into K⁻ π⁺, but the π⁺ is absorbed or not detected, then you might see a single K⁻. However, in that case, the event would have other particles as well, like the muon from the initial neutrino interaction. \n\nBut the statement is that the production of single K⁻ mesons by neutrinos is evidence for D⁰ production. So the reasoning would be that the only way to get a K⁻ is through D⁰ decay, hence seeing K⁻ implies D⁰ production. But if there are other ways to produce K⁻, then the statement is false. \n\nIn reality, strange particles can be produced in neutrino interactions via Cabibbo-suppressed processes without charm production. For example, a neutrino could interact with a sea quark (s quark) in the target, producing a u quark, leading to a K⁻ in the hadronic shower. However, such processes are rare compared to charm production if the energy is sufficient. \n\nBut if the neutrino energy is below the charm production threshold (which is around a few GeV), then producing a K⁻ would require Cabibbo-suppressed processes. However, if the energy is above the charm threshold, then D⁰ production is possible, and the K⁻ from D⁰ decay would be more probable. \n\nTherefore, the truth of the statement depends on the energy of the neutrinos. If the experiment is conducted at high energy where charm production is possible, then observing single K⁻ mesons could be evidence for D⁰ production. But if the energy is too low for charm, then the K⁻ must come from other processes, so the statement would be false. \n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the energy. However, given that the D⁰ mass is 1.8 GeV/c², producing it would require the neutrino energy to be sufficiently high. Assuming the neutrinos are high energy, then the production of K⁻ via D⁰ decay is plausible. \n\nBut even so, the D⁰ decay produces a K⁻ and a π⁺. So unless the π⁺ is not detected, you wouldn't have a single K⁻. If the experiment can't detect the π⁺ (maybe because it's a neutral pion? No, π⁺ is charged. So if the detector can track charged particles, the π⁺ should be detected. Therefore, if a K⁻ is observed without an accompanying π⁺, it's not from D⁰ decay. Hence, the production of single K⁻ mesons (without associated π⁺) would not be evidence for D⁰ production. \n\nTherefore, the statement is likely false. Because the decay of D⁰ would produce both K⁻ and π⁺, so observing a single K⁻ (without the π⁺) cannot be direct evidence for D⁰ production. Unless there's a reason why the π⁺ isn't observed, but the problem states \"single K⁻ mesons\", implying only the K⁻ is seen. Hence, the statement is false. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in some cases the D⁰ is produced, but the π⁺ is missed. However, in that case, the evidence would be indirect and possibly ambiguous. But the presence of a K⁻ alone isn't conclusive evidence for D⁰ production because there are other production mechanisms. Therefore, the statement is false.\n</think>\n\n(a) To find the momentum of the K⁻ meson in the rest frame of the D⁰, we use the two-body decay formula:  \n\\[\np = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\left[M_D^2 - (m_K + m_\\pi)^2\\right]\\left[M_D^2 - (m_K - m_\\pi)^2\\right]}}{2M_D}\n\\]  \nSubstituting \\(M_D = 1.8 \\, \\text{GeV}/c^2\\), \\(m_K = 0.5 \\, \\text{GeV}/c^2\\), and \\(m_\\pi = 0.15 \\, \\text{GeV}/c^2\\):  \n\\[\np = \\frac{\\sqrt{(1.8^2 - 0.65^2)(1.8^2 - 0.35^2)}}{2 \\times 1.8} = \\frac{\\sqrt{(3.24 - 0.4225)(3.24 - 0.1225)}}{3.6} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2.8175 \\times 3.1175}}{3.6} \\approx \\frac{2.963}{3.6} \\approx 0.823 \\, \\text{GeV}/c.\n\\]  \nThus, the momentum of the K⁻ meson is:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{0.82 \\, \\text{GeV}/c}\n\\]\n\n(b) The statement is **false**. The decay \\(D^0 \\to K^- + \\pi^+\\) produces both a \\(K^-\\) and a \\(\\pi^+\\).

{"id": "atomic/3-51", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question about unpolarized electrons and their wave functions. Hmm, the question is asking whether an unpolarized electron beam can be described by a wave function that's an equal superposition of spin-up and spin-down states, or if it can't be described by a wave function at all, or neither.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an unpolarized beam means. In quantum mechanics, a polarized particle has its spin state in a definite direction, like spin-up or spin-down along some axis. But unpolarized means the spins are randomly oriented, right? So there's no preferred direction, and each electron's spin is in a random state. \n\nNow, the options given are (a) equal superposition of spin-up and spin-down, (b) cannot be described by a wave function, and (c) neither. \n\nOption (a) suggests that each electron is in a superposition state. Wait, but if each electron is in a superposition, like (|↑> + |↓>)/√2, then that's actually a polarized state—specifically, polarized in the x-direction (assuming up and down are z-direction). Because a superposition of spin-up and spin-down in the z basis would correspond to a definite spin in the x or y direction. So if the beam is unpolarized, that would mean the electrons are in a mixed state, not a pure superposition. \n\nAh, right! A pure state is a coherent superposition, which is a definite state (like polarized), whereas a mixed state is a statistical ensemble of different pure states. So an unpolarized beam is a mixed state, not a pure state. But in quantum mechanics, a single particle's state is described by a wave function (a pure state). However, when you have a statistical mixture, like an ensemble of particles in different states with certain probabilities, that's a mixed state, which can't be represented by a single wave function. \n\nSo for part (a), if the wave function is an equal superposition, that's a pure state, which would correspond to a polarized beam, not unpolarized. Therefore, (a) is incorrect. \n\nOption (b) says it cannot be described by a wave function. But wait, each individual electron does have a wave function. However, the ensemble is a mixed state. So when we talk about the beam as a whole, it's a statistical mixture, not a single wave function. But does that mean each electron's state is unknown, so the system is in a mixed state? So in that case, the beam can't be described by a single wave function, but each electron is in some pure state, just that we don't know which one. \n\nBut the question is about the beam of unpolarized electrons. If the beam is unpolarized, then each electron's spin is in a random direction. So the proper description is a density matrix representing a statistical mixture. Since a single wave function can't describe a mixed state, the answer would be (b) cannot be described by a wave function. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The question says \"a beam of unpolarized electrons can be described by a wave function...\" So if the beam is a collection of electrons, each in a different state, then the ensemble is a mixed state. But each individual electron is in a pure state. However, when we talk about the beam as a whole, we use a density matrix. So the beam as a whole can't be described by a single wave function. Therefore, option (b) is correct? But wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to each electron in the beam. If each electron is unpolarized, but that's impossible because an individual electron must be in a pure state (wave function). But \"unpolarized\" would mean that the spin state is completely random, which for a single electron isn't possible—it has to be in some state. So the concept of unpolarized applies to an ensemble, not individual particles. Therefore, the beam as a whole is a mixed state, which can't be written as a single wave function. So the answer would be (b). \n\nBut wait, another angle: sometimes people might confuse mixed states with superpositions. For example, if you have a 50-50 mixture of spin-up and spin-down electrons, that's a mixed state. But if each electron is in a superposition, that's a pure state. So the key difference is that a superposition is a pure state (coherent), while a mixed state is statistical (incoherent). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (b) because an unpolarized beam is a mixed state, which cannot be described by a single wave function. However, wait, the option (a) says \"equal superposition\", which is a pure state. So (a) is incorrect because that would be a polarized state (in x-direction, for example). So the answer is (b). \n\nBut wait, some sources say that an unpolarized beam is a completely mixed state, which requires a density matrix, not a wave function. So yes, (b) is correct. \n\nWait, but wait again. Let me check. The wave function of a single electron can be in a superposition, but if the beam is unpolarized, each electron's spin is in a random direction. So each electron is in a definite state, but we don't know which. So the ensemble is a mixed state. But each individual electron has a wave function. However, the problem is about the beam as a whole. So the beam's state is a statistical mixture, which can't be described by a single wave function. Therefore, the answer is (b). \n\nBut another thought: if the beam is unpolarized, then the density matrix is proportional to the identity matrix. So the density matrix is (|↑><↑| + |↓><↓|)/2. This is a mixed state, not a pure state. Therefore, the beam cannot be described by a single wave function. So (b) is correct. \n\nBut wait, the question is about the beam of electrons. Each electron in the beam is in a pure state, but the ensemble is a mixed state. So when the question says \"can be described by a wave function\", it's asking if the entire beam can be described by a single wave function. Since it's a mixed state, the answer is no. So (b) is correct. \n\nBut then why is option (c) there? Maybe there's a nuance. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the question says \"a beam of unpolarized electrons\". If each electron is in a mixed state, but in reality, each electron must be in a pure state. However, if we don't know the state of each electron, the ensemble is a mixed state. So the beam as a whole is a statistical mixture. Therefore, the beam's state is a mixed state, which cannot be represented by a single wave function. So (b) is correct. \n\nBut some sources might argue that even a mixed state can be considered as a statistical ensemble of wave functions. However, the key point is that a single wave function can't describe a mixed state. Therefore, the answer is (b). \n\nBut wait, another perspective: in quantum mechanics, a system must be in a pure state (wave function) or a mixed state (density matrix). If the system is in a mixed state, then it cannot be described by a wave function. Therefore, the answer is (b). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (b). But wait, I need to check if there's a standard answer to this. \n\nWait, I recall that in quantum mechanics, an unpolarized beam is a mixed state. A pure state is a completely polarized beam. So the answer should be (b) because a mixed state can't be written as a single wave function. \n\nBut wait, the question is part (a) says \"an equal superposition of spin-up and spin-down\". That would be a pure state, which is polarized, not unpolarized. So (a) is wrong. (b) says cannot be described by a wave function. Since the beam is a mixed state, which can't be described by a single wave function, (b) is correct. So the answer is (b). \n\nBut wait, another angle: maybe the question is a trick. Because sometimes people confuse the ensemble with individual particles. Each electron is in a pure state, but the ensemble is mixed. However, the question is about the beam as a whole. So the beam's state is a mixed state, which can't be described by a wave function. So (b) is correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the beam is considered as a single quantum system, which it's not. Each electron is a separate system. So each electron is in some pure state, but the ensemble is a mixture. Therefore, the beam as a whole can't be described by a single wave function. So (b) is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (b). But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes people use the term \"unpolarized\" to mean a completely mixed state. So yes, (b) is correct. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me check a textbook. For example, in quantum mechanics, a system that is unpolarized (like completely mixed spin state) is described by the density matrix ρ = (|↑><↑| + |↓><↓|)/2. This is a mixed state, which cannot be written as a single wave function. Therefore, the correct answer is (b). \n\nSo the answer should be (b). But wait, the options are (a), (b), (c). The question is from a standard quantum mechanics perspective. So the answer is (b). \n\nBut wait, another thought: if the electrons are unpolarized, does that mean each electron is in a superposition, but with random phases? For example, if each electron is in (|↑> + e^{iθ}|↓>)/√2 with θ random, then the ensemble average would be a mixed state. But each individual electron is in a pure state. However, the problem states \"a beam of unpolarized electrons can be described by a wave function...\". If the beam is described by a single wave function, that would imply all electrons are in the same state. But if they are in different states (random), then the beam can't be described by a single wave function. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (b). So the correct answer is (b). \n\nBut wait, the original question says \"A beam of unpolarized electrons (a) can be described by a wave function that is an equal superposition...\" So if the beam is a collection of electrons, each in a different state, then the beam as a whole can't be described by a single wave function. So (b) is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (b). But wait, I'm now second-guessing because sometimes people might confuse the ensemble with individual states. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (c) neither. Because the beam is a mixed state, which can't be described by a wave function (so (a) is wrong, (b) is correct). But wait, the options are (a), (b), (c). If (b) is correct, then the answer is (b). But maybe there's a nuance here. \n\nWait, another approach: in quantum mechanics, any system must be in a pure state (wave function) or a mixed state (density matrix). An unpolarized beam is a mixed state. Therefore, it cannot be described by a single wave function. So (b) is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (b). \n\nBut wait, I just found a possible contradiction. If each electron is in a pure state, but the beam is a collection of different pure states, then the beam is a mixed state. So the beam as a whole can't be described by a wave function. Therefore, (b) is correct. \n\nYes, I think that's right. So the answer is (b).\n</think>\n\nA beam of unpolarized electrons cannot be described by a single wave function because it represents a mixed state. In quantum mechanics, a mixed state arises from a statistical ensemble of particles in different pure states, which cannot be combined into a single coherent wave function. \n\n- **Option (a)** suggests an equal superposition of spin-up and spin-down states, which corresponds to a pure state (e.g., polarized in a specific direction like the x-axis). This is incorrect because an unpolarized beam is not a coherent superposition but a statistical mixture.  \n- **Option (b)** correctly states that the beam cannot be described by a wave function. Unpolarized electrons form a mixed state, requiring a density matrix (not a single wave function) for their description.  \n- **Option (c)** is unnecessary since (b) is valid.  \n\nThus, the correct answer is **(b)**. \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["B"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "B", "expr2": "(a)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "B", "expr2": "a"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "atomic/4-41", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these three parts one by one. Starting with part (a). The question is about finding the mean distance traveled by the J/ψ particle before decaying. Hmm, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width via the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is given as 63 keV. The formula connecting lifetime τ and width is Γ = ħ/τ, right? So τ = ħ/Γ. But wait, ħ is Planck's constant over 2π, and in natural units where ħ = c = 1, but here we need to convert units properly because the answer is in distance, which requires considering c.\n\nWait, the mass is given in GeV/c², and the width in keV. The momentum is in GeV/c. Let me make sure the units are consistent. Since the width is given in keV, which is much smaller than GeV, I need to convert that to GeV first. 63 keV is 63 × 10³ eV = 63 × 10⁻⁶ GeV. So Γ = 63 × 10⁻⁶ GeV.\n\nThen τ = ħ / Γ. But ħ in units of GeV·s is approximately 6.582 × 10⁻²⁵ GeV·s. So τ = (6.582 × 10⁻²⁵ GeV·s) / (63 × 10⁻⁶ GeV) = (6.582 / 63) × 10⁻²⁵ + 6 s. Let me compute that. 6.582 divided by 63 is approximately 0.1045. So τ ≈ 0.1045 × 10⁻¹⁹ s ≈ 1.045 × 10⁻²⁰ seconds. That's the mean lifetime in the particle's rest frame.\n\nBut the particle is moving at a certain momentum in the lab frame, so we need to account for time dilation. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is γτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Then the mean distance traveled is vγτ. Wait, actually, the mean distance is the lab frame velocity multiplied by the lab frame lifetime (which is γτ). So L = v * γτ.\n\nBut to compute γ, we need the velocity. The particle's momentum is given as 100 GeV/c. The mass is 3.097 GeV/c². So the energy E of the J/ψ in the lab frame is sqrt(p²c² + m²c⁴)/c²? Wait, in natural units where c=1, E = sqrt(p² + m²). But here, since units are given with c's, let's be careful.\n\nMomentum p = 100 GeV/c. Mass m = 3.097 GeV/c². So energy E = sqrt( (pc)² + (mc²)² ) / c²? Wait, no. Wait, in standard units, E = sqrt( (pc)² + (mc²)² ). But if p is given in GeV/c, then pc would be GeV. Similarly, mc² is in GeV. So E = sqrt( (100 GeV)^2 + (3.097 GeV)^2 ) = sqrt(10000 + 9.59) GeV ≈ sqrt(10009.59) ≈ 100.05 GeV. So γ is E / (mc²) = (100.05 GeV) / (3.097 GeV) ≈ 32.3. So γ ≈ 32.3.\n\nThen the velocity v is pc² / E. Wait, in natural units, v = p/E. But with units, since p = γ m v, and E = γ m c², so v = pc² / E. Wait, maybe better to compute β = v/c = pc / E. Since p is 100 GeV/c, so pc is 100 GeV. E is 100.05 GeV. So β = 100 / 100.05 ≈ 0.9995. So v ≈ 0.9995c.\n\nSo the mean distance L is v * γ τ. Wait, τ is the proper lifetime, so the lab lifetime is γ τ. Then L = v * γ τ. So substituting the numbers:\n\nFirst, compute γ τ: γ ≈ 32.3, τ ≈ 1.045 × 10⁻²⁰ s. So γ τ ≈ 32.3 * 1.045e-20 ≈ 3.37e-19 seconds. Then v ≈ 0.9995c ≈ 3e8 m/s. So L ≈ 3.37e-19 s * 3e8 m/s ≈ 1.01e-10 meters. Wait, that's 0.101 nanometers. That seems really small. But maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let's check the lifetime calculation again. Γ is given as 63 keV. Converting that to GeV: 63 keV = 63 * 10^3 eV = 63 * 10^3 * 10^-9 GeV = 63 * 10^-6 GeV = 6.3e-5 GeV. Then τ = ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 6.3e-5 ≈ 1.045e-20 seconds. That's correct.\n\nThen γ is E / m. E is sqrt(p² + m²) = sqrt(100^2 + 3.097^2) ≈ 100.05 GeV. So γ ≈ 100.05 / 3.097 ≈ 32.3. Correct.\n\nThen γ τ is 32.3 * 1.045e-20 ≈ 3.37e-19 s. Then velocity v = β c ≈ (p c)/E c = (100 GeV / c * c)/100.05 GeV ≈ 100 / 100.05 ≈ 0.9995c. So v ≈ 0.9995 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.9985e8 m/s.\n\nThen L = v * γ τ ≈ 2.9985e8 m/s * 3.37e-19 s ≈ 1.01e-10 m, which is 0.101 nanometers. That seems extremely short. But maybe that's correct? The J/ψ has a very short lifetime, even when moving at high energy. But 0.1 nm is like atomic scale. Wait, but particles with short lifetimes do travel very small distances. For example, a tau lepton with a lifetime of ~3e-13 seconds, moving at relativistic speeds, might travel millimeters. But here, the lifetime is 1e-20 seconds, which is much shorter. So even with gamma factor of 30, the lifetime is 3e-19 seconds, so multiplied by speed near c, gives 3e-19 * 3e8 = 9e-11 meters, which is 0.09 nanometers. So yes, that's correct. So part (a) answer is approximately 0.1 nm. Let me write that properly.\n\nWait, let me check the calculation again step by step.\n\nΓ = 63 keV = 63e3 eV = 63e3 * 1.602e-19 J = but maybe better to convert keV to GeV. 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, so 63 keV = 63e3 eV = 63e3 / 1e9 GeV = 63e-6 GeV = 6.3e-5 GeV.\n\nτ = ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 6.3e-5 ≈ (6.582 / 6.3) * 1e-20 ≈ 1.045e-20 s.\n\nγ = E / m. E = sqrt(p² + m²) = sqrt(100² + 3.097²) ≈ sqrt(10000 + 9.59) ≈ sqrt(10009.59) ≈ 100.05 GeV. So γ ≈ 100.05 / 3.097 ≈ 32.3.\n\nThen lab frame lifetime is γτ ≈ 32.3 * 1.045e-20 ≈ 3.37e-19 s.\n\nVelocity v = (pc²)/E. Wait, in natural units, β = p/E. Since p = 100 GeV/c, E = 100.05 GeV. So β = (100 / c) / (100.05) * c? Wait, maybe better to compute β = (pc) / E. Since p = 100 GeV/c, pc = 100 GeV. E = 100.05 GeV. So β = 100 / 100.05 ≈ 0.9995. So v ≈ 0.9995c.\n\nThen L = v * γτ ≈ 0.9995c * 3.37e-19 s. c is 3e8 m/s. So L ≈ 0.9995 * 3e8 * 3.37e-19 ≈ 3e8 * 3.37e-19 * 1 ≈ 1.011e-10 m ≈ 1.01e-10 meters, which is 0.101 nanometers. So yes, that's correct. So part (a) answer is approximately 0.1 nm. But let's write it in meters with proper units. 1.01e-10 m is 1.01 × 10⁻¹⁰ m, which is 0.101 nm. So boxed as \\boxed{1.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}} or similar.\n\nMoving on to part (b): For a symmetric decay, find the energy of the decay electron in the laboratory. Symmetric decay means the e+ and e- have the same lab momenta. Since the J/ψ is at rest, the decay would be back-to-back with equal energy in the rest frame. But in the lab frame, the J/ψ is moving, so we need to boost the decay products. But the problem states that the decay is symmetric, i.e., e+ and e- have same lab momenta. So their momenta in the lab frame are equal in magnitude and direction? Wait, no. If the decay is symmetric, maybe they have the same magnitude but opposite directions? But the problem says \"same laboratory momenta\", which would mean same magnitude and direction, but that's impossible because they are emitted in opposite directions in the rest frame. Wait, maybe \"same laboratory momenta\" means same magnitude but opposite directions? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the problem says \"symmetric decay\", which usually implies that in the rest frame, the decay is symmetric, i.e., the electrons are emitted back-to-back with equal energy. But when boosted to the lab frame, their energies and momenta would be different. However, the problem states that in the lab frame, the e+ and e- have the same momenta. So their momenta vectors are the same? That would mean they are moving in the same direction with same magnitude, which is not possible unless the J/ψ is at rest. But the J/ψ is moving. So perhaps the symmetric decay refers to the fact that in the lab frame, the electrons have equal momenta magnitudes but opposite directions perpendicular to the J/ψ motion? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the lab frame, the decay is symmetric in the sense that the e+ and e- have the same energy and their momenta are symmetric with respect to the J/ψ direction. For example, they could be emitted at equal angles from the J/ψ direction, with equal energies. But the problem says \"same laboratory momenta\", which probably means their momentum vectors are the same. But that can't happen unless they are moving in the same direction, which would violate conservation of momentum unless the J/ψ was at rest. Wait, but the J/ψ is moving. So maybe the problem is referring to the magnitude of the momenta being the same, but directions are opposite? Let me check the conservation laws.\n\nIn the rest frame of the J/ψ, the decay is J/ψ → e+ + e-. Since the J/ψ is at rest, the e+ and e- must have equal and opposite momenta. So in the rest frame, their momenta are p and -p. Then, when we boost to the lab frame (which is moving along the direction of the J/ψ's motion), the electrons will have their momenta transformed. The problem states that in the lab frame, the e+ and e- have the same momenta. Wait, but if their rest frame momenta are opposite, after a boost, their lab momenta would not be the same unless the boost is along the direction of their momenta. Wait, but the J/ψ is moving in the lab frame. Let's assume that the decay in the J/ψ rest frame is isotropic, but the problem specifies a symmetric decay, so maybe the electrons are emitted perpendicular to the boost direction? Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the symmetric decay refers to the electrons having equal energies in the lab frame. But the question specifically says \"same laboratory momenta\", which would mean their momentum vectors are identical. That seems impossible unless the J/ψ is at rest. But the J/ψ is moving. Therefore, maybe the problem is using \"symmetric\" in a different way. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the decay is symmetric in the sense that the electrons are emitted at equal angles with respect to the J/ψ's direction of motion in the lab frame, and their momenta have the same magnitude. So their momenta vectors are symmetric with respect to the J/ψ direction. In that case, their transverse momenta would cancel out, and the longitudinal components would add up. But the J/ψ's momentum is along a certain direction, say the z-axis. Then, in the lab frame, the electrons would have momenta making some angle θ with the z-axis, and their transverse components (perpendicular to z) would cancel, while the longitudinal components add up to match the J/ψ's momentum. Wait, but the J/ψ is decaying, so the total momentum of the decay products should equal the J/ψ's momentum. So if the electrons have equal and opposite transverse momenta, their total momentum would be along the z-axis, matching the J/ψ's momentum. That makes sense. So in this case, each electron would have a momentum vector with magnitude p, and angles ±θ with respect to the z-axis. Then, the total momentum would be 2p cosθ in the z-direction, which should equal the J/ψ's momentum of 100 GeV/c. Also, their energies would each be E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 ). But the problem states that the decay is symmetric, so the electrons have the same lab momenta. So their momenta vectors are symmetric around the J/ψ direction, and their magnitudes are equal. Therefore, the total momentum of the two electrons is along the J/ψ's direction and equals 100 GeV/c. So we can set up equations for this.\n\nLet me denote the momentum of each electron in the lab frame as p_e. The angle between each electron's momentum and the J/ψ's direction is θ. Then, the total momentum in the lab frame is 2 p_e cosθ = 100 GeV/c. Also, energy conservation: the total energy of the electrons should equal the energy of the J/ψ, which is 100.05 GeV as calculated earlier. So 2 E_e = 100.05 GeV, so E_e = 50.025 GeV. But wait, the energy of each electron is E_e = sqrt( (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 ). Since m_e is about 0.511 MeV/c², which is negligible compared to GeV scales. So E_e ≈ p_e c. Then, if E_e ≈ 50 GeV, then p_e ≈ 50 GeV/c. Then, 2 p_e cosθ = 100 GeV/c. So 2 * 50 GeV/c * cosθ = 100 GeV/c → cosθ = 1 → θ = 0. But that would mean the electrons are moving in the same direction as the J/ψ, which can't be because their total momentum would be 100 GeV/c, but their energies would be 50 GeV each, summing to 100 GeV, which matches the J/ψ's energy. Wait, but if θ = 0, then both electrons are moving in the same direction as the J/ψ, each with momentum 50 GeV/c. Then total momentum is 100 GeV/c, and total energy is 100 GeV. But the J/ψ's energy is 100.05 GeV, so there's a discrepancy. Wait, this suggests that the approximation E_e ≈ p_e c is very good, but the exact energy would be slightly higher. Let's compute it properly.\n\nEach electron's energy is E_e = sqrt( (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 ). Let's compute m_e c²: 0.511 MeV = 0.000511 GeV. So (m_e c²)^2 = (0.000511)^2 (GeV)^2 ≈ 2.61e-7 (GeV)^2. If p_e is 50 GeV/c, then (p_e c)^2 = (50 GeV)^2 = 2500 (GeV)^2. So E_e ≈ sqrt(2500 + 0.000000261) ≈ 50 GeV. So the approximation holds. Then, the total energy would be 2 * 50 GeV = 100 GeV, but the J/ψ's energy is 100.05 GeV. There's a missing 0.05 GeV. That suggests that this approach might not be correct. Wait, but energy and momentum must be conserved. The J/ψ's energy is 100.05 GeV, and its momentum is 100 GeV/c. So the total energy of the decay products must be 100.05 GeV, and their total momentum must be 100 GeV/c. If we assume that each electron has momentum p_e at angle θ, then:\n\nTotal momentum: 2 p_e cosθ = 100 GeV/c.\n\nTotal energy: 2 sqrt( (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 ) = 100.05 GeV.\n\nWe can solve these two equations for p_e and θ. Let's write them:\n\n1. 2 p_e cosθ = 100 GeV/c.\n\n2. 2 sqrt( (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 ) = 100.05 GeV.\n\nLet me divide the second equation by c to get units consistent. Wait, actually, let's work in natural units where c=1 for simplicity. Then:\n\n1. 2 p_e cosθ = 100 GeV.\n\n2. 2 sqrt( p_e² + m_e² ) = 100.05 GeV.\n\nGiven that m_e = 0.511 MeV = 0.000511 GeV. So m_e² ≈ 2.61e-7 GeV².\n\nFrom equation 2: sqrt(p_e² + m_e²) = 50.025 GeV.\n\nSquare both sides: p_e² + m_e² = (50.025)^2 ≈ 2502.5 GeV².\n\nSo p_e² ≈ 2502.5 - 2.61e-7 ≈ 2502.5 GeV².\n\nThus, p_e ≈ sqrt(2502.5) ≈ 50.025 GeV.\n\nSo p_e ≈ 50.025 GeV.\n\nThen from equation 1: 2 * 50.025 * cosθ = 100 → cosθ = 100 / (2 * 50.025) ≈ 100 / 100.05 ≈ 0.9995. So θ ≈ arccos(0.9995) ≈ 1.73 degrees.\n\nBut the problem asks for the energy of the decay electron in the lab. Each electron's energy is sqrt(p_e² + m_e²) ≈ 50.025 GeV. So the energy is approximately 50.025 GeV. But let's compute it more accurately.\n\nsqrt( (50.025)^2 + (0.000511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2502.5 + 2.61e-7) ≈ 50.025 GeV. So yes, the energy is essentially 50.025 GeV. But wait, the J/ψ's energy is 100.05 GeV, and two electrons sum to 100.05 GeV. So that checks out. Therefore, the energy of each electron is 50.025 GeV. But let me check if there's a more precise way.\n\nAlternatively, since the decay is symmetric, we can analyze it in the rest frame of the J/ψ and then boost to the lab frame. In the rest frame, the J/ψ has energy equal to its mass, 3.097 GeV. The decay products, e+ and e-, each have energy E' = m_J/ψ / 2 = 1.5485 GeV, since in the rest frame, the electrons are emitted back-to-back with equal energy. Their momenta in the rest frame would be p' = sqrt(E'^2 - m_e^2) ≈ sqrt( (1.5485)^2 - (0.000511)^2 ) ≈ 1.5485 GeV/c. So each electron has momentum 1.5485 GeV/c in opposite directions in the rest frame.\n\nNow, to boost to the lab frame where the J/ψ is moving with momentum 100 GeV/c. The boost is along the direction of the J/ψ's motion (let's say the z-axis). The electrons in the rest frame are emitted at some angle. If in the rest frame they are emitted isotropically, but the problem states it's a symmetric decay, so perhaps they are emitted along the direction of motion or opposite. Wait, but in the rest frame, they are emitted back-to-back. If we boost along the z-axis, their lab frame momenta will depend on their emission angles in the rest frame.\n\nBut the problem states that in the lab frame, the electrons have the same momenta. So their momenta in the lab frame must be the same. That can only happen if in the rest frame, they are emitted along the boost direction. Because if they are emitted along the boost direction, then after the boost, their momenta will be different. Wait, but if one is emitted in the same direction as the boost and the other opposite, their lab frame momenta would not be the same. So maybe in the rest frame, they are emitted perpendicular to the boost direction? Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the symmetric decay in the lab frame requires that the electrons are emitted symmetrically with respect to the boost direction. For example, in the rest frame, they are emitted at ±θ' with respect to the z-axis, and after the boost, their lab frame momenta are equal in magnitude and direction. Wait, that seems impossible unless θ' is 0 or 180, but then they would not be symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the decay in the rest frame is such that the electrons are emitted perpendicular to the boost direction. Then, after the boost, their momenta would have a component from the boost. But I need to apply the Lorentz transformation for momentum.\n\nLet me recall that when boosting from the rest frame (S') to the lab frame (S) moving along the z-axis with velocity v (corresponding to Lorentz factor γ), the momentum components transform as:\n\np_z = γ (p'_z + β E')\n\np_x = p'_x\n\np_y = p'_y\n\nE = γ (E' + β p'__z)\n\nIn the rest frame, let's assume that one electron is emitted at angle θ' from the z-axis. Then its momentum components are p'_z = p' cosθ', p'_x = p' sinθ', p'_y = 0. The other electron has p'_z = -p' cosθ', p'_x = -p' sinθ', p'_y = 0.\n\nAfter boosting to the lab frame, the momentum components for the first electron become:\n\np1_z = γ (p' cosθ' + β E')\n\np1_x = p' sinθ'\n\nE1 = γ (E' + β p' cosθ')\n\nSimilarly, for the second electron:\n\np2_z = γ (-p' cosθ' + β E')\n\np2_x = -p' sinθ'\n\nE2 = γ (E' - β p' cosθ')\n\nFor the lab frame momenta to be the same for both electrons, their momentum vectors must be identical. That requires p1_z = p2_z, p1_x = p2_x, etc. But looking at p1_x and p2_x: p1_x = p' sinθ', p2_x = -p' sinθ'. For these to be equal, p' sinθ' = -p' sinθ', which implies sinθ' = 0. So θ' must be 0 or π. But if θ' = 0, then the electrons are emitted along the boost direction. Then, their lab frame momenta would be:\n\nFor θ' = 0:\n\np1_z = γ (p' + β E')\n\nE1 = γ (E' + β p')\n\nFor the other electron, θ' = π, so p'_z = -p':\n\np2_z = γ (-p' + β E')\n\nE2 = γ (E' - β p')\n\nBut for these to be the same, we need p1_z = p2_z and E1 = E2. That would require:\n\nγ (p' + β E') = γ (-p' + β E') → p' + β E' = -p' + β E' → 2p' = 0 → p' = 0. But p' is the momentum in the rest frame, which is non-zero. So this is impossible. Therefore, the only way for the lab frame momenta to be the same is if the electrons are emitted in such a way that their transformed momenta are equal. This seems only possible if they are emitted perpendicular to the boost direction in the rest frame. Let's try θ' = 90 degrees. Then p'_z = 0, p'_x = p', p'_y = 0.\n\nThen, for each electron:\n\np1_z = γ (0 + β E') = γ β E'\n\np1_x = p'\n\nE1 = γ (E' + β * 0) = γ E'\n\nSimilarly, the other electron has p'_z = 0, p'_x = -p':\n\np2_z = γ β E'\n\np2_x = -p'\n\nE2 = γ E'\n\nSo in the lab frame, the two electrons have the same z-component of momentum (γ β E') but opposite x-components. Therefore, their momenta are not the same. The problem states that they have the same laboratory momenta, which would require their vectors to be identical. This seems impossible unless p' = 0, which can't be. Therefore, the only possibility is that the electrons are emitted along the boost direction in the rest frame, but as we saw earlier, this leads to different lab momenta. Therefore, there must be a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering that the electrons are emitted in the lab frame with the same magnitude of momentum but opposite directions. But the problem says \"same laboratory momenta\", which would imply same vector. Alternatively, maybe \"same laboratory momenta\" refers to the magnitude, not the direction. If that's the case, then each electron has momentum of magnitude p_e, but directions such that their vector sum is 100 GeV/c. But the problem states \"symmetric decay\", which might mean that the electrons are emitted symmetrically with respect to the J/ψ direction, leading to their momenta having the same magnitude and opposite transverse components. In that case, their total momentum is along the J/ψ's direction. This brings us back to the earlier approach where we set up the equations for momentum and energy conservation.\n\nSo, using that approach, we found that each electron has energy approximately 50.025 GeV. But let's do the exact calculation.\n\nGiven:\n\nTotal momentum: 2 p_e cosθ = 100 GeV/c.\n\nTotal energy: 2 sqrt( (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 ) = 100.05 GeV.\n\nLet me write the equations again with c=1 (GeV units where c=1):\n\nMomentum: 2 p_e cosθ = 100 GeV.\n\nEnergy: 2 sqrt( p_e² + m_e² ) = 100.05 GeV.\n\nWe can solve for p_e:\n\nFrom energy equation:\n\nsqrt(p_e² + m_e²) = 50.025 GeV.\n\nSquare both sides:\n\np_e² + m_e² = (50.025)^2 ≈ 2502.500625 GeV².\n\nSo p_e² ≈ 2502.500625 - (0.000511)^2 ≈ 2502.500625 - 2.61e-7 ≈ 2502.500625 GeV².\n\nThus, p_e ≈ sqrt(2502.500625) ≈ 50.025 GeV.\n\nSo p_e ≈ 50.025 GeV/c.\n\nThen, from momentum equation:\n\n2 * 50.025 * cosθ = 100 → cosθ = 100 / (2 * 50.025) ≈ 100 / 100.05 ≈ 0.9995.\n\nThus, θ ≈ arccos(0.9995) ≈ 1.73 degrees.\n\nBut the problem asks for the energy of the decay electron, which is sqrt(p_e² + m_e²) ≈ 50.025 GeV. So the energy is approximately 50.025 GeV. But let's compute it more precisely.\n\nGiven that m_e = 0.000511 GeV, so m_e² = (0.000511)^2 = 2.61121e-7 GeV².\n\nThen, p_e² = (50.025)^2 = 2502.500625 GeV².\n\nSo sqrt(2502.500625 + 2.61121e-7) ≈ sqrt(2502.500625) = 50.025 GeV. So the energy is exactly 50.025 GeV. Therefore, the energy of each electron is 50.025 GeV. So part (b) answer is \\boxed{50.0 \\text{ GeV}} (approximating to three significant figures, since the J/ψ's energy was given as 100.05 GeV which is five significant figures, but the mass was 3.097, four significant figures. The width was 63 keV, two significant figures. The momentum was 100 GeV/c, which could be one or three significant figures depending on context. Since 100 is ambiguous, but in physics problems, often trailing zeros are not significant unless specified. So maybe 100 is one significant figure, but the answer would then be 50 GeV. But the calculation gave 50.025, which is 50.0 GeV if we take three significant figures. The problem might expect the answer as 50 GeV, but given that the J/ψ's energy was 100.05 GeV, which is five significant figures, but the momentum is 100 GeV/c (possibly three), it's safer to go with three. So 50.0 GeV. But let's check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more precise way using Lorentz transformations from the rest frame.\n\nIn the rest frame of the J/ψ, each electron has energy E' = 1.5485 GeV (half of 3.097 GeV), and momentum p' = sqrt(E'^2 - m_e^2) ≈ 1.5485 GeV/c.\n\nThen, boosting to the lab frame moving with velocity v along the z-axis. The Lorentz factor γ is 32.3 as before, and β ≈ 0.9995.\n\nThe energy of each electron in the lab frame is given by:\n\nE = γ (E' + β p'_z)\n\nAssuming the electrons are emitted along the direction of motion (θ' = 0) in the rest frame, then p'_z = p' = 1.5485 GeV/c.\n\nSo E1 = γ (E' + β p') = 32.3 * (1.5485 + 0.9995 * 1.5485) ≈ 32.3 * (1.5485 * (1 + 0.9995)) ≈ 32.3 * 1.5485 * 1.9995 ≈ 32.3 * 3.096 ≈ 100.0 GeV. But wait, that's the energy for one electron? No, that can't be. Wait, no, if the electron is emitted in the same direction as the boost, its energy would be higher. The other electron emitted opposite would have E2 = γ (E' - β p') ≈ 32.3 * (1.5485 - 0.9995 * 1.5485) ≈ 32.3 * 1.5485 * (1 - 0.9995) ≈ 32.3 * 1.5485 * 0.0005 ≈ 32.3 * 0.000774 ≈ 0.025 GeV. So one electron has energy ~100 GeV, the other ~0.025 GeV. But this contradicts the symmetric condition where both have same lab momenta. Therefore, this approach isn't correct because the symmetric condition requires a different emission angle in the rest frame.\n\nAlternatively, if the electrons are emitted perpendicular to the boost direction in the rest frame (θ' = 90 degrees), then p'_z = 0, and their energy in the lab frame would be E = γ E' ≈ 32.3 * 1.5485 ≈ 50.0 GeV. Their momentum in the z-direction would be γ β E' ≈ 32.3 * 0.9995 * 1.5485 ≈ 32.3 * 1.547 ≈ 50.0 GeV/c. The transverse momentum p_x would be p'_x = p' = 1.5485 GeV/c. So in the lab frame, each electron has momentum (50.0 GeV/c in z, 1.5485 GeV/c in x). But then the total momentum would be 2 * 50.0 GeV/c in z and 0 in x (since the other electron has -1.5485 GeV/c in x). So total momentum is 100 GeV/c in z, matching the J/ψ's momentum. The total energy would be 2 * 50.0 GeV = 100 GeV, but the J/ψ's energy is 100.05 GeV. There's a discrepancy of 0.05 GeV. This suggests that this approach is missing something.\n\nWait, but in reality, the electrons have a small mass, so their energy in the rest frame is E' = 1.5485 GeV, which is slightly larger than p' = 1.5485 GeV/c (since E' = sqrt(p'^2 + m_e^2)). So E' ≈ 1.5485 GeV, p' ≈ 1.5485 GeV/c. Then, when boosting, the energy becomes E = γ (E' + β p'_z). If emitted perpendicular, p'_z = 0, so E = γ E' ≈ 32.3 * 1.5485 ≈ 50.0 GeV. The momentum in the z-direction is γ β E' ≈ 32.3 * 0.9995 * 1.5485 ≈ 50.0 GeV/c. The transverse momentum remains p'_x = 1.5485 GeV/c. So each electron has momentum (50.0 GeV/c, 1.5485 GeV/c, 0), but the other electron has (50.0 GeV/c, -1.5485 GeV/c, 0). So their total momentum is (100 GeV/c, 0, 0), which matches the J/ψ's momentum. The total energy is 2 * 50.0 GeV = 100 GeV, but the J/ψ's energy is 100.05 GeV. The missing 0.05 GeV is because we neglected the electron mass in the rest frame energy. Let's compute E' more accurately.\n\nIn the rest frame, E' = sqrt(p'^2 + m_e^2). p' = sqrt(E'^2 - m_e^2). But since the J/ψ's mass is 3.097 GeV, each electron gets E' = 3.097 / 2 = 1.5485 GeV. Then p' = sqrt( (1.5485)^2 - (0.000511)^2 ) ≈ 1.5485 GeV/c. So when boosting, the energy in the lab frame is E = γ (E' + β p'_z). If emitted perpendicular, p'_z = 0, so E = γ E' ≈ 32.3 * 1.5485 ≈ 50.025 GeV. Ah, here we go. Because 32.3 * 1.5485 ≈ 32.3 * 1.5 = 48.45, 32.3 * 0.0485 ≈ 1.566, total ≈ 50.016 GeV. More precisely, 32.3 * 1.5485:\n\n32 * 1.5485 = 49.552\n\n0.3 * 1.5485 = 0.46455\n\nTotal ≈ 49.552 + 0.46455 ≈ 50.0165 GeV. So each electron has energy ≈ 50.0165 GeV. Then total energy is 2 * 50.0165 ≈ 100.033 GeV, which is close to the J/ψ's energy of 100.05 GeV. The small discrepancy is due to rounding errors. Therefore, the energy of each electron is approximately 50.02 GeV. So rounding to three significant figures, 50.0 GeV.

{"id": "atomic/1-1", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so the question is about whether the contents of a physics library could be put on a postcard and still be readable with an electron microscope. Let me start by breaking this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scale involved here. A physics library has a lot of information—books, journals, articles. Let's say the library has, I don't know, maybe 100,000 books? Each book is maybe a few hundred pages. If we want to put all that on a postcard, we're talking about massive data compression. The key here is data density. How much information can you fit into a small area?\n\nA standard postcard is about 4x6 inches, which is roughly 10x15 cm. Converting that to meters, that's 0.1m x 0.15m, so the area is 0.015 square meters. But we need to think in terms of area for data storage. Let's say we're using some kind of nanoscale writing. The question is about using an electron microscope to read it, so the resolution of the electron microscope is important.\n\nElectron microscopes can achieve much higher resolutions than optical microscopes because they use electrons with much shorter wavelengths. The resolution limit is roughly on the order of angstroms (0.1 nanometers) for transmission electron microscopes (TEMs). Let's assume we can write data at that scale. So each bit of information would be a feature that's maybe a few angstroms in size.\n\nLet's calculate the data density. If each bit is, say, 0.5 nm x 0.5 nm (which is 5 angstroms per side), then each bit occupies 0.25 square nanometers. Converting the postcard area to square nanometers: 0.015 m² is 0.015 * (1e9 nm)^2 = 0.015 * 1e18 nm² = 1.5e16 nm². So the number of bits would be 1.5e16 nm² / 0.25 nm² per bit = 6e16 bits. Converting that to bytes (since 1 byte = 8 bits), that's 7.5e15 bytes, which is 7.5 petabytes. \n\nBut wait, how much data is in a physics library? Let's estimate. If each book is about 1 MB (text only, but maybe including some images), 100,000 books would be 1e5 MB = 100 GB. That's way less than a petabyte. So even if we have higher resolution, maybe we can store way more. But maybe the library has more data. Let's say each book is 10 MB, then 100,000 books would be 1e6 MB = 1 TB. Still, 7.5 petabytes is way more than that. So the data density is sufficient. \n\nBut the problem is about readability. Even if you can store the data at that density, can an electron microscope read it? Electron microscopes can image at atomic scales, but there are practical limitations. For example, sample preparation is crucial. The material needs to be conductive to prevent charging, and it has to withstand the vacuum. Also, the process of writing such data would require manipulating atoms or something similar, which is possible with techniques like electron beam lithography or atomic force microscopy, but on a postcard-sized area, that's a huge task. \n\nAssuming the data is written properly, the electron microscope could in theory read it. But there's another factor: time. Scanning a postcard-sized area with an electron microscope would take an incredibly long time. The field of view in an electron microscope is very small. For example, a TEM might image a region of a few micrometers across. To cover the entire postcard, you'd need to take countless images and stitch them together, which is practically infeasible. \n\nMoreover, the data would need to be encoded in a way that the microscope can detect. For example, using raised dots or different materials that the electrons can distinguish. If the data is stored as pits (like a CD) but at the nanoscale, the microscope could detect those variations. But again, the time to scan the entire area would be prohibitive. \n\nAnother consideration is information retrieval. Even if you can image the entire postcard, you need to decode the data. The encoding scheme must be known, and the system must be able to convert the physical structures (like dots) back into digital data. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Theoretically, if the data is written at a density compatible with electron microscope resolution, and assuming the technical challenges of writing and reading such a dense medium are overcome, it might be possible. However, practically, the time required to read the entire postcard with an electron microscope would be enormous, making it infeasible with current technology. Also, the physical limitations of the microscope (like sample preparation, stability, and data processing) would pose significant challenges.\n</think>\n\nThe feasibility of reading a postcard-sized physics library with an electron microscope depends on data density, resolution, and practical limitations.  \n\n1. **Data Density**:  \n   - A postcard (~0.015 m²) written at **0.5 nm per bit** (electron microscope resolution) holds ~7.5 petabytes.  \n   - A physics library (~100,000 books at 10 MB each) totals ~1 terabyte, far below this capacity.  \n\n2. **Resolution**:  \n   Electron microscopes (e.g., TEMs) resolve features down to **0.1 nm**, theoretically enabling atomic-scale data retrieval.  \n\n3. **Practical Challenges**:  \n   - **Scanning Time**: Imaging the entire postcard would require stitching countless high-resolution frames, taking years to decades.  \n   - **Sample Preparation**: The material must be conductive, stable in a vacuum, and free of charging artifacts.  \n   - **Data Decoding**: Physical encoding (e.g., pits or material variations) must match the microscope’s detection capabilities.  \n\n**Conclusion**: While theoretically possible at the resolution limit, practical barriers (time, sample prep, decoding) make it infeasible with current technology.  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{No, due to impractical scanning time and technical limitations.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{No, due to impractical scanning time and technical limitations.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{No, due to impractical scanning time and technical limitations.}", "expr2": "\\text{Yes, it will be readable with an electron microscope.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "atomic/4-12", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the minimum energy that a moving proton must have to produce a particle of rest mass M when colliding with a proton at rest. Then, also figure out the corresponding energy if both protons are moving towards each other with equal velocity. Hmm, let's start with the first part.\n\nI remember that in particle collisions, the minimum energy required for producing a new particle happens when all the resulting particles are at rest in the center-of-momentum frame. That way, there's no kinetic energy wasted, and all the energy goes into the rest mass. So maybe I should use conservation of energy and momentum here, or maybe use the invariant quantity in relativity, like the Mandelstam variable s.\n\nWait, the problem is similar to the threshold energy calculation for particle production. The formula for the threshold energy when one particle is at rest is something like E_min = ((2m + M)^2 - m^2)/(2m), where m is the proton mass. Let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, using conservation of energy and momentum. Let's denote the rest mass of the proton as m. The moving proton has energy E and momentum p. The target proton is at rest, so its energy is m. After the collision, we have two protons and the particle of mass M. At threshold, all three particles (two protons and M) will be moving together with the same velocity, right? So their momenta add up, but since they are at rest in the COM frame, maybe in the lab frame (where one proton is at rest) they have some common velocity.\n\nWait, maybe better to use the invariant s = (total energy)^2 - (total momentum)^2 c^2. Since in the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum is zero, so s is just (total energy in COM frame)^2. The threshold occurs when the total energy in the COM frame is equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products. So s = (2m + M)^2 c^4. Then, in the lab frame, the total energy is E + m (since one proton is at rest, energy m, and the other has energy E). The total momentum is p (since the moving proton has momentum p, and the target has zero). So s is also equal to (E + m c^2)^2 - (p c)^2. Setting this equal to (2m + M)^2 c^4.\n\nBut E and p are related for the moving proton. Since it's a proton, its energy is gamma m c^2 and momentum is gamma v m. Alternatively, using E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So substituting p c = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4). Then, s = (E + m c^2)^2 - (sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4))^2 = (E + m c^2)^2 - (E^2 - m^2 c^4) = E^2 + 2 E m c^2 + m^2 c^4 - E^2 + m^2 c^4 = 2 E m c^2 + 2 m^2 c^4.\n\nSet this equal to (2m + M)^2 c^4. So:\n\n2 E m c^2 + 2 m^2 c^4 = (4 m^2 + 4 m M + M^2) c^4\n\nDivide both sides by c^4:\n\n2 E m + 2 m^2 = 4 m^2 + 4 m M + M^2\n\nThen, solving for E:\n\n2 E m = 4 m^2 + 4 m M + M^2 - 2 m^2 = 2 m^2 + 4 m M + M^2\n\nSo E = (2 m^2 + 4 m M + M^2)/(2 m) = ( (2 m + M)^2 )/(2 m )\n\nTherefore, E = (2m + M)^2/(2m) * c^2? Wait, but units. Wait, in the equations above, we divided by c^4, but actually, the units here might be a bit confusing. Let me check again.\n\nWait, s has units of energy squared. So when we set s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2, that's in (energy)^2. So when we set (E + m c^2)^2 - (p c)^2 = (2m + M)^2 c^4. Then, E is the energy of the incoming proton, which is gamma m c^2, and p is gamma m v. But using E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2, so (p c)^2 = E^2 - m^2 c^4.\n\nTherefore, substituting into s:\n\n(E + m c^2)^2 - (E^2 - m^2 c^4) = (2m + M)^2 c^4\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nE^2 + 2 E m c^2 + m^2 c^4 - E^2 + m^2 c^4 = 2 E m c^2 + 2 m^2 c^4\n\nSet equal to (2m + M)^2 c^4:\n\n2 E m c^2 + 2 m^2 c^4 = (4 m^2 + 4 m M + M^2) c^4\n\nDivide both sides by c^2:\n\n2 E m + 2 m^2 c^2 = (4 m^2 + 4 m M + M^2) c^2\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the units here. Let me check again. The left side is 2 E m c^2 + 2 m^2 c^4. The right side is (2m + M)^2 c^4. So when we divide both sides by c^4, we get:\n\n2 E m / c^2 + 2 m^2 = (2m + M)^2\n\nThen, solving for E:\n\n2 E m / c^2 = (2m + M)^2 - 2 m^2\n\nMultiply both sides by c^2 / (2m):\n\nE = [ (2m + M)^2 - 2 m^2 ] c^2 / (2m )\n\nExpanding (2m + M)^2:\n\n4 m^2 + 4 m M + M^2 - 2 m^2 = 2 m^2 + 4 m M + M^2\n\nSo E = (2 m^2 + 4 m M + M^2) c^2 / (2 m )\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n= [ (2 m + M)^2 - 2 m^2 + 2 m^2 ]? Wait, no. Wait, 2 m^2 + 4 m M + M^2 is (2m + M)^2 - 2 m^2 + 2 m^2? No, that's not helpful. Let's factor:\n\nE = [ M^2 + 4 m M + 2 m^2 ] c^2 / (2 m )\n\nAlternatively, factor as:\n\n= [ M^2 + 4 m M + 4 m^2 - 2 m^2 ] / (2 m ) * c^2\n\n= [ (M + 2 m)^2 - 2 m^2 ] / (2 m ) * c^2\n\nBut maybe it's better to leave it as:\n\nE = ( (2m + M)^2 ) / (2m ) * c^2 - m c^2 ?\n\nWait, let me check again. Wait, the expression (2 m + M)^2 / (2 m ) * c^2 would be (4 m^2 + 4 m M + M^2)/(2 m ) * c^2 = (2 m + 2 M + M^2/(2 m )) * c^2. Hmm, but that's not the same as what we have. Wait, no, the numerator is (2m + M)^2, so when divided by 2m, it's (2m + M)^2/(2m). So E = (2m + M)^2/(2m) * c^2 - m c^2? Wait, no, because in the previous step, we had:\n\nE = [ (2m + M)^2 c^4 - 2 m^2 c^4 ] / (2 m c^2 )\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the units. Let's go back step by step.\n\nOriginal equation after equating s:\n\n2 E m c^2 + 2 m^2 c^4 = (2m + M)^2 c^4\n\nSubtract 2 m^2 c^4 from both sides:\n\n2 E m c^2 = (2m + M)^2 c^4 - 2 m^2 c^4\n\nFactor the right side:\n\n= [ (2m + M)^2 - 2 m^2 ] c^4\n\nExpand (2m + M)^2:\n\n= [4 m^2 + 4 m M + M^2 - 2 m^2 ] c^4\n\n= [2 m^2 + 4 m M + M^2 ] c^4\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2 m c^2:\n\nE = [2 m^2 + 4 m M + M^2 ] c^4 / (2 m c^2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [2 m^2 + 4 m M + M^2 ] c^2 / (2 m )\n\nSo E = (M² + 4 m M + 2 m²) c² / (2 m )\n\nAlternatively, factor numerator:\n\n= (M² + 4 m M + 4 m² - 2 m²) c² / (2 m )\n\n= [ (M + 2 m)^2 - 2 m² ] c² / (2 m )\n\nBut not sure if that helps. Alternatively, factor as:\n\n= [ M² + 4 m M + 2 m² ] / (2 m ) c²\n\nBut perhaps it's better to write it as:\n\nE = ( (2m + M)^2 - 2 m² ) / (2m ) * c²\n\nBut expanding (2m + M)^2 gives 4m² + 4mM + M², so subtracting 2m² gives 2m² +4mM + M², which is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, factor:\n\n= (2m² +4mM + M²)/(2m) * c² = [2m²/(2m) +4mM/(2m) + M²/(2m)] c² = [m + 2M + M²/(2m)] c²\n\nBut that's not particularly helpful. So the minimum energy the moving proton must have is E = ( (2m + M)^2 )/(2m ) c² - m c²? Wait, no. Wait, the total energy of the moving proton is E, and the expression we derived is E = (2m² +4mM + M²)c²/(2m). Let's check with M=0, which should give the case where no particle is produced, so the threshold would be when the protons just stick together. But if M=0, then E = (2m²)c²/(2m) = m c², which is just the rest energy. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, if M=0, the process is producing nothing, but the problem states that a particle of rest mass M is produced in addition to the two protons. So M cannot be zero. But if we take M approaching zero, then the threshold energy should approach the energy needed for two protons at rest. Wait, but if M approaches zero, then the threshold energy would be E = (2m + 0)^2/(2m) c² - something? Wait, no. Let's plug M=0 into our formula:\n\nE = (2m² +0 +0 ) c²/(2m ) = (2m²)/(2m ) c² = m c². But that's the rest energy. But if the incoming proton has energy m c² (i.e., it's at rest), then the total energy is 2m c², which in the COM frame would be sqrt(s) = 2m c², but to produce two protons, you need at least 2m c², which is already there. But in reality, when M=0, the process is elastic scattering, so the threshold is zero. Hmm, maybe my formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. The invariant s must be equal to the square of the total rest mass in the threshold case. So s = (2m + M)^2 c^4. Then, in the lab frame, s is (E + m c²)^2 - (p c)^2. But E is the energy of the incoming proton, which is gamma m c², and p is gamma m v. Then, using E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2, so (p c)^2 = E^2 - m² c^4. Therefore, s = (E + m c²)^2 - (E² - m² c^4) = E² + 2 E m c² + m² c^4 - E² + m² c^4 = 2 E m c² + 2 m² c^4. Setting this equal to (2m + M)^2 c^4:\n\n2 E m c² + 2 m² c^4 = (4 m² + 4 m M + M²) c^4\n\nSubtract 2 m² c^4:\n\n2 E m c² = (2 m² + 4 m M + M²) c^4\n\nDivide both sides by 2 m c²:\n\nE = (2 m² + 4 m M + M²) c² / (2 m )\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So when M=0, E = (2 m²) c²/(2 m ) = m c². But that would imply that the proton needs only its rest energy, which is at rest, but that's contradictory because if the proton is at rest, the total energy is 2 m c², which is exactly the rest mass of two protons. So producing nothing extra, which is elastic collision. So maybe the formula is correct. So when M=0, the threshold energy is m c², which is the rest energy, but in reality, the proton is already at rest, so maybe the formula is considering the lab frame where one proton is at rest and the other has energy E. So if E = m c², then the total energy is 2 m c², which is the minimum to have two protons. But in reality, you can't produce anything extra. So perhaps the formula is correct in that when M=0, you just need the rest energy, but in reality, that's the case where no extra particle is produced. So maybe the formula is okay.\n\nTherefore, the minimum energy is E = ( (2m + M)^2 )/(2m ) c² - m c²? Wait, no. Wait, the energy E we found is the total energy of the incoming proton. So the kinetic energy would be E - m c². But the question asks for the minimum energy the moving proton must have, which is the total energy E. Because in relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy. So the answer is E = ( (2m + M)^2 )/(2m ) c².\n\nBut let's check units. m has units of mass, M same. So (2m + M)^2 / (2m ) * c² would have units of (mass^2 / mass ) * velocity² = mass * velocity², which is energy. So units are correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we write it as E = [ (2m + M)^2 / (2m) ] c².\n\nYes. So that's the total energy. So the moving proton must have at least this energy. So that's the first part.\n\nNow, the second part: What would be the corresponding energy if the original protons are moving towards one another with equal velocity?\n\nSo now, instead of one proton at rest and the other moving, both are moving towards each other with equal velocity. So it's a symmetric situation. The threshold would occur when the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is equal to the sum of the rest masses, which is 2m + M. But in this case, since the protons are moving towards each other with equal velocity, the total momentum is zero? Wait, no. Wait, if they have equal velocity in magnitude but opposite direction, then their momenta are equal and opposite. So total momentum is zero. Therefore, the center-of-momentum frame is the same as the lab frame in this case. Wait, no. Wait, if they are moving towards each other with equal speed in some frame, then yes, the total momentum is zero. So in that frame, the threshold energy is simply the sum of their rest masses plus the produced particle's rest mass. Wait, but each proton has energy gamma m c², and since there are two of them, total energy is 2 gamma m c². At threshold, this total energy must equal the sum of the rest masses: 2 gamma m c² = (2m + M) c². Therefore, gamma = (2m + M)/(2m). Therefore, the kinetic energy per proton is (gamma - 1) m c². But the question asks for the corresponding energy, which is probably the total energy per proton, or the kinetic energy? Wait, the question says: \"the corresponding energy if the original proton were moving towards one another with equal velocity\". So maybe each proton has the same speed, so in that frame, the total energy is 2 gamma m c², which must equal (2m + M) c². Therefore, gamma = (2m + M)/(2m). Therefore, the energy each proton must have is gamma m c² = (2m + M)/(2m) * m c² = (2m + M)/2 * c². So each proton has energy (2m + M)/2 * c². Therefore, the corresponding energy in this case is (2m + M)/2 * c² per proton. But the question says \"the corresponding energy\", so maybe they want the total energy? But the original question in the first part was the minimum energy the moving proton must have, which was [(2m + M)^2/(2m)] c². So in the second case, since both are moving, each with energy (2m + M)/2 c², so the total energy is (2m + M) c². But in the first case, the total energy was E + m c² = [(2m + M)^2/(2m)] c² + m c²? Wait, no. Wait, in the first case, the moving proton has energy E = [(2m + M)^2/(2m)] c², and the target is at rest with energy m c². So total energy is E + m c² = [(2m + M)^2/(2m) + m] c². Let's compute that:\n\n[( (4m² + 4mM + M² )/(2m) ) + m ] c² = [ (4m² + 4mM + M² + 2m² )/(2m) ) ] c² = (6m² + 4mM + M²)/(2m) ) c². Which is more than (2m + M) c². So in the second case, the total energy required is less, which makes sense because when both protons are moving towards each other, you can get the same COM energy with less energy per proton.\n\nBut the question is asking for the corresponding energy if the original protons are moving towards one another with equal velocity. So in this case, each proton has energy (2m + M)/2 c². So the answer for the second part is (2m + M)/2 c². But wait, let me confirm.\n\nIn the center-of-momentum frame, the threshold condition is that the total energy is equal to the sum of the rest masses: 2m + M. So the total energy in COM frame is (2m + M) c². But if the protons are moving towards each other with equal velocity in some frame (which would be the COM frame), then the total energy is 2 gamma m c² = (2m + M) c². Therefore, gamma = (2m + M)/(2m). Therefore, each proton has energy gamma m c² = (2m + M)/2 c². Therefore, the corresponding energy each proton must have is (2m + M)/2 c². So the answer for the second part is (2m + M)/2 c².\n\nBut wait, the question says \"the original proton were moving towards one another with equal velocity\". So maybe they are asking for the energy each proton must have in that case. So the answer would be (2m + M)/2 c². But let's check with M=0. Then, each proton would have energy (2m)/2 c² = m c², which is their rest energy. So they are at rest, which makes sense because if M=0, you can't produce anything, so the protons just stay at rest. So that checks out.\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\nFirst part: E = (2m + M)^2/(2m) c²\n\nSecond part: E = (2m + M)/2 c²\n\nBut let me write them in terms of m_p (proton mass) and M. Since the problem states the rest mass of the produced particle is M, and protons have rest mass m. So the answers are:\n\nMinimum energy for moving proton (first case): [(2m + M)^2 / (2m)] c²\n\nCorresponding energy when both protons move towards each other with equal velocity: [(2m + M)/2] c²\n\nYes, that seems right. Let me just verify with an example. Suppose M = 2m. Then first case: (2m + 2m)^2/(2m) c² = (4m)^2/(2m) c² = 16 m² / 2m c² = 8 m c². Second case: (2m + 2m)/2 c² = 4m/2 c² = 2 m c². Which makes sense, because if both protons have 2m c² each, total energy is 4m c², which is the same as the rest mass 2m + 2m = 4m. Wait, but the produced particle is M=2m, so total rest mass is 2m + 2m = 4m. So yes, in the second case, the total energy is 4m c², which is exactly the rest mass, so all energy is rest mass, no kinetic energy. So that's the threshold. So that checks out.\n\nAnother example: M=0. First case: (2m)^2/(2m) c² = 4m²/2m c² = 2m c². So the moving proton must have 2m c², and the target is at rest m c², total energy 3m c². But the rest mass needed is 2m, so 3m c² is more than enough. Wait, but if M=0, we can't produce anything, so the threshold should be when the total energy is 2m c². But according to the formula, when M=0, the moving proton needs 2m c², and the target is m c², total 3m c². That seems contradictory. Wait, but maybe when M=0, the process is just two protons colliding and remaining two protons, so the threshold is zero. But according to the formula, the minimum energy is 2m c². That suggests a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the first part. Let me think again. When M=0, the process is just two protons colliding and remaining two protons. So the threshold energy should be zero, but according to our formula, the moving proton needs 2m c². That can't be right. So where is the mistake?\n\nAh, I think the mistake is in the assumption that when M=0, the produced particle is nothing, but the problem states that a particle of rest mass M is produced in addition to the two protons. So M cannot be zero. Therefore, the formula is valid for M > 0. So when M approaches zero, the threshold energy approaches (2m)^2/(2m) c² = 2m c². Which would mean that even to produce a massless particle (which isn't physical), you need 2m c². But in reality, for M=0, the process is elastic, and the threshold is zero. So perhaps the formula is correct for M > 0, considering that you have to produce an additional particle. So if M is a real particle with rest mass, then the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, the answers are as derived. So final answers:\n\nFirst part: The minimum energy the moving proton must have is [(2m + M)^2]/(2m) c².\n\nSecond part: When protons are moving towards each other with equal velocity, each must have energy (2m + M)/2 c².\n\nSo boxed answers:\n\nFirst part: \\boxed{ \\frac{(2m + M)^2}{2m} c^2 }\n\nSecond part: \\boxed{ \\frac{(2m + M)}{2} c^2 }\n</think>\n\nTo determine the minimum energy required for a moving proton to produce a particle of rest mass \\( M \\) in a collision with a proton at rest, we use the relativistic invariant \\( s \\), which must equal the square of the total rest mass energy in the center-of-momentum (COM) frame. \n\n1. **Proton at Rest and Moving Proton Collision:**\n   - The invariant \\( s \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     s = (E_{\\text{total}})^2 - (p_{\\text{total}} c)^2\n     \\]\n   - In the lab frame, the total energy is \\( E + m c^2 \\) (where \\( E \\) is the energy of the moving proton and \\( m c^2 \\) is the rest energy of the stationary proton), and the total momentum is \\( p \\). Using the relation \\( E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 \\), we substitute \\( p c = \\sqrt{E^2 - m^2 c^4} \\).\n   - Setting \\( s = (2m + M)^2 c^4 \\) (the threshold condition), we solve for \\( E \\):\n     \\[\n     (E + m c^2)^2 - (E^2 - m^2 c^4) = (2m + M)^2 c^4\n     \\]\n     Simplifying, we find:\n     \\[\n     E = \\frac{(2m + M)^2}{2m} c^2\n     \\]\n\n2. **Protons Moving Towards Each Other with Equal Velocity:**\n   - In this symmetric case, the total momentum in the COM frame is zero. The total energy in the COM frame must equal the sum of the rest masses:\n     \\[\n     2 \\gamma m c^2 = (2m + M) c^2\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( \\gamma \\), we get \\( \\gamma = \\frac{2m + M}{2m} \\). The energy per proton is:\n     \\[\n     E = \\gamma m c^2 = \\frac{2m + M}{2} c^2\n     \\]\n\n### Final Answers:\n- **Minimum energy for the moving proton:**\n  \\[\n  \\boxed{ \\frac{(2m + M)^2}{2m} c^2 }\n  \\]\n- **Corresponding energy for protons moving towards each other with equal velocity:**\n  \\[\n  \\boxed{ \\frac{(2m + M)}{2} c^2 }\n  \\]", "final_answers": ["\\frac{(2m + M)^2}{2m} c^2", "\\frac{(2m + M)}{2} c^2", "\\frac{(2m + M)^2}{2m} c^2", "\\frac{(2m + M)}{2} c^2"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{(2m + M)^2}{2m} c^2", "expr2": "E_p = m_p + 2M + \\frac{M^2}{2m_p}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "c**2*(M**2 + 4*m*(M + m))/(2*m)", "expr2": "M**2/(2*m) + 2*M + m"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{(2m + M)^2}{2m} c^2", "expr2": "E_p = m_p + \\frac{M}{2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "c**2*(M**2 + 4*m*(M + m))/(2*m)", "expr2": "M/2 + m"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{(2m + M)}{2} c^2", "expr2": "E_p = m_p + 2M + \\frac{M^2}{2m_p}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "c**2*(M/2 + m)", "expr2": "M**2/(2*m) + 2*M + m"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{(2m + M)}{2} c^2", "expr2": "E_p = m_p + \\frac{M}{2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "c**2*(M/2 + m)", "expr2": "M/2 + m"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{(2m + M)^2}{2m} c^2", "expr2": "E_p = m_p + 2M + \\frac{M^2}{2m_p}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "c**2*(M**2 + 4*m*(M + m))/(2*m)", "expr2": "M**2/(2*m) + 2*M + m"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{(2m + M)^2}{2m} c^2", "expr2": "E_p = m_p + \\frac{M}{2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "c**2*(M**2 + 4*m*(M + m))/(2*m)", "expr2": "M/2 + m"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{(2m + M)}{2} c^2", "expr2": "E_p = m_p + 2M + \\frac{M^2}{2m_p}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "c**2*(M/2 + m)", "expr2": "M**2/(2*m) + 2*M + m"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{(2m + M)}{2} c^2", "expr2": "E_p = m_p + \\frac{M}{2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "c**2*(M/2 + m)", "expr2": "M/2 + m"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-6", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The question is about broadening mechanisms in the spectral line of carbon ions. The given conditions are thermal equilibrium with temperature kT=20 eV, density n=10^24 m^-3, and a non-uniform magnetic field up to 1 Tesla. The natural line width is very small, so observed broadening must come from other factors. \n\nFirst, I remember that spectral lines can be broadened by several mechanisms. The main ones are natural broadening, Doppler broadening, pressure (or collisional) broadening, and Stark broadening. Also, in the presence of a magnetic field, Zeeman effect can split the line, but if the field is non-uniform and varying, that might cause broadening instead of splitting. \n\nNatural broadening is due to the uncertainty principle related to the lifetime of the excited state. But since the problem states to consider when T, n, and B are very small, and here they are not, natural broadening is probably negligible here. \n\nDoppler broadening is due to the thermal motion of the ions. When ions move towards or away from the observer, the observed wavelength shifts due to the Doppler effect. Since the temperature here is 20 eV, which is quite high (though I should check if that's the ion temperature or electron temperature; the problem says ion temperature). High temperature means high thermal velocities, so Doppler broadening should be significant. \n\nPressure broadening (collisional broadening) occurs because collisions between particles interrupt the emission process, shortening the lifetime of the excited state and thus broadening the line via the uncertainty principle. High density (n=10^24 m^-3) would lead to frequent collisions, so this mechanism is likely important here. \n\nStark broadening is due to electric fields from nearby charged particles perturbing the energy levels. In a plasma with high density, Stark effect could be significant. But Stark broadening is usually more prominent in high-density plasmas with electrons, as electrons have higher velocities and more frequent interactions. Since the ions are at high density, maybe Stark broadening is also a factor here. \n\nThen there's the magnetic field effect. The Zeeman effect splits a spectral line into multiple components in a magnetic field. However, if the magnetic field is non-uniform and varies across the plasma, the different ions experience different field strengths, leading to a spread in the splitting. Instead of distinct lines, you get a broadening. So this would be another mechanism here. \n\nSo for part (a), the possible broadening mechanisms are Doppler (thermal motion), pressure (collisional), Stark (electric fields from charges), and Zeeman (due to varying B field). The question mentions that T, n, and B are non-zero, so each of these parameters contributes to a different mechanism. \n\nNow moving to part (b), need to calculate the broadened width Δλ for one mechanism. Let's pick one. The easiest might be Doppler broadening because the formula is straightforward. Alternatively, Zeeman might be manageable if I remember the splitting. Let's see.\n\nDoppler broadening formula: Δλ/λ ≈ sqrt( (2kT)/(m c²) ), where m is the mass of the ion. Let's check the numbers. kT is given as 20 eV. Wait, but kT in thermal terms usually uses T in Kelvin, but here they directly give kT=20 eV. So T is (20 eV)/k, but maybe we can just use the formula with kT in energy units. \n\nWait, the Doppler width (Gaussian profile) has a FWHM given by Δλ = λ * sqrt( (8 k T ln 2) / (m c²) ) ). Alternatively, the thermal velocity v is sqrt(2kT/m), and the Doppler shift is Δλ/λ ≈ v/c. So the width would be on the order of (v/c)*λ. \n\nLet me compute that. The ion is carbon-12, so mass is 12 u. 1 u is about 1.66e-27 kg. So m = 12 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 2e-26 kg. \n\nkT is 20 eV. 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so kT = 20 * 1.6e-19 = 3.2e-18 J. \n\nv = sqrt(2kT/m) = sqrt(2 * 3.2e-18 / 2e-26) = sqrt(3.2e-18 / 1e-26) = sqrt(3.2e8) ≈ 1.8e4 m/s. \n\nThen Δλ/λ ≈ v/c = 1.8e4 / 3e8 ≈ 6e-5. \n\nGiven λ = 500 nm, Δλ ≈ 500e-9 m * 6e-5 ≈ 3e-11 m = 0.03 nm. That seems small, but maybe I made a mistake. Wait, but kT here is 20 eV, which is extremely high. Wait, room temperature is about 0.025 eV, so 20 eV is a temperature of like 20/(8.6e-5 eV/K) ≈ 2.3e5 K. But ions in plasmas can have such high temperatures. \n\nWait, but maybe the Doppler broadening formula uses the thermal velocity component along the line of sight, which is sqrt(kT/m), not sqrt(2kT/m). Let me check. The RMS velocity is sqrt(3kT/m) in 3D, but the component along one axis is sqrt(kT/m). So the Doppler shift would be (v_rms)/c = sqrt(kT/(m c²)). \n\nWait, different sources might have different factors. Let me check the standard formula for Doppler broadening. The Doppler width (FWHM) is given by Δλ = λ * sqrt( (8 k T ln 2) / (m c²) ). Let's compute that. \n\nFirst, compute kT in Joules: 20 eV = 20 * 1.6e-19 = 3.2e-18 J. \n\nm = 12 * 1.66e-27 kg = 1.99e-26 kg. \n\nSo (8 * kT * ln2)/m = (8 * 3.2e-18 * 0.693)/1.99e-26 ≈ (8 * 3.2e-18 * 0.693)/1.99e-26 ≈ (17.75e-18)/1.99e-26 ≈ 8.92e8. \n\nTake the square root: sqrt(8.92e8) ≈ 29870. \n\nThen divide by c (3e8 m/s): 29870 / 3e8 ≈ 9.96e-5. \n\nMultiply by λ (500e-9 m): 500e-9 * 9.96e-5 ≈ 4.98e-11 m ≈ 0.05 nm. So Δλ ≈ 0.05 nm. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"order-of-magnitude estimates\". So maybe approximate. Let's see. Alternatively, if I use the simpler approach: Δλ ≈ λ * v/c. \n\nv = sqrt(2kT/m) = sqrt(2*3.2e-18 / 2e-26) = sqrt(3.2e8) ≈ 1.8e4 m/s. \n\nv/c ≈ 1.8e4 / 3e8 = 6e-5. \n\nΔλ = 500 nm * 6e-5 = 0.03 nm. So around 0.03 to 0.05 nm. But the problem states that the original photon is 2.5 eV, which is 500 nm. The question is, is this a significant broadening? Let's compare with other mechanisms. \n\nAlternatively, pressure broadening. The collisional rate is n * σ * v, where σ is the cross-section. The collision frequency ν_coll ≈ n * σ * v. The uncertainty in energy ΔE ≈ ħ ν_coll, leading to Δλ ≈ (λ²/c) * (ΔE/h). \n\nBut I need to estimate σ. For ions, maybe the cross-section is on the order of the atomic size, say 1e-18 m² (but this is a guess). Let's see. n=1e24 m^-3, v=1.8e4 m/s (from before). σ=1e-18 m². Then ν_coll = 1e24 * 1e-18 * 1.8e4 = 1.8e10 collisions per second. Then ΔE ≈ ħ * ν_coll ≈ 1e-34 J·s * 1.8e10 1/s ≈ 1.8e-24 J. Convert to eV: 1.8e-24 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV ≈ 1.1e-5 eV. The energy of the photon is 2.5 eV, so ΔE/E ≈ 4.4e-6. Then Δλ ≈ λ * (ΔE/E) ≈ 500 nm * 4.4e-6 ≈ 0.0022 nm. That's much smaller than Doppler. So pressure broadening here might be less significant. \n\nStark broadening: in plasmas, Stark broadening due to electric fields from electrons and ions. The electric field from nearby charges. The Stark effect can cause line broadening. The formula for Stark width can be complex, but for hydrogenic ions, it's proportional to the electron density. However, for non-hydrogenic ions like C, it's less straightforward. But maybe for order of magnitude, the Stark width can be estimated. \n\nAlternatively, Zeeman effect. The splitting due to magnetic field B is ΔE = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. For a transition with Δm = ±1, the splitting is ΔE = μ_B * B. For B=1 T, μ_B = 9.27e-24 J/T. So ΔE = 9.27e-24 J. Convert to eV: 9.27e-24 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 5.8e-5 eV. The photon energy is 2.5 eV, so Δλ ≈ λ * (ΔE/E) = 500 nm * (5.8e-5 / 2.5) ≈ 500e-9 m * 2.3e-5 ≈ 1.15e-11 m ≈ 0.0115 nm. But if the magnetic field is non-uniform up to 1 T, then the variation in B would lead to a spread in ΔE. If B varies from 0 to 1 T, then the maximum splitting is 5.8e-5 eV, so the width would be twice that, so ΔE ≈ 1.16e-4 eV. Then Δλ ≈ 500 nm * (1.16e-4 / 2.5) ≈ 500e-9 * 4.64e-5 ≈ 2.32e-11 m ≈ 0.023 nm. \n\nComparing the mechanisms: Doppler gives ~0.05 nm, Zeeman ~0.023 nm, pressure ~0.002 nm. So Doppler and Zeeman are comparable here. But the problem states that the magnetic field is non-uniform up to 1 T. So if the magnetic field varies across the plasma, different ions experience different B, leading to different shifts. The total broadening would be due to the range of B. So if B ranges from 0 to 1 T, the maximum shift is as calculated. But maybe the average is over the volume. However, the problem says \"order-of-magnitude\", so maybe the Zeeman broadening is about 0.02 nm. \n\nBut the question says \"calculate the broadened width using order-of-magnitude estimates\". So which one is easier? Doppler requires temperature, Zeeman requires B. Let's pick Doppler because the temperature is given directly. Wait, but the ion temperature is 20 eV. Wait, but wait, the thermal velocity depends on the mass. Carbon ions are much heavier than electrons, so even at 20 eV, their thermal velocity is lower. \n\nWait, let's recalculate Doppler with correct mass. Carbon-12 ion mass: 12 atomic mass units. 1 u = 1.66e-27 kg, so 12 u = 12*1.66e-27 = 1.99e-26 kg. \n\nkT is 20 eV = 20 * 1.6e-19 J = 3.2e-18 J. \n\nv = sqrt( (2kT)/m ) = sqrt( (2*3.2e-18)/1.99e-26 ) = sqrt(6.4e-18 / 1.99e-26 ) = sqrt(3.22e8) ≈ 1.79e4 m/s. \n\nΔλ/λ = v/c = 1.79e4 / 3e8 ≈ 5.97e-5. \n\nΔλ = 500 nm * 5.97e-5 ≈ 0.0298 nm ≈ 0.03 nm. \n\nBut wait, the actual Doppler broadening formula for FWHM is Δλ = λ * sqrt( (8 ln 2) kT / (m c²) ). Let's compute that. \n\n(8 ln 2 * kT) / (m c²) = (8 * 0.693 * 3.2e-18) / (1.99e-26 * (3e8)^2 )\n\nFirst compute numerator: 8 * 0.693 ≈ 5.544; 5.544 * 3.2e-18 ≈ 1.774e-17.\n\nDenominator: 1.99e-26 * 9e16 = 1.99e-26 * 9e16 = 1.79e-9.\n\nSo the ratio is 1.774e-17 / 1.79e-9 ≈ 9.91e-9.\n\nTake square root: sqrt(9.91e-9) ≈ 9.96e-5.\n\nMultiply by λ: 500e-9 m * 9.96e-5 ≈ 4.98e-11 m = 0.0498 nm ≈ 0.05 nm. \n\nSo the Doppler broadening is about 0.05 nm. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects a larger broadening, maybe Stark or pressure is more significant. But with n=1e24 m^-3, which is 1e18 cm^-3. Wait, 1 m^-3 = 1e-6 cm^-3, so 1e24 m^-3 = 1e18 cm^-3. That's a very high density. For Stark broadening, high electron densities lead to significant broadening. But wait, the density given is ion density. If the plasma is quasi-neutral, electron density is similar. So n_e ~ 1e24 m^-3. \n\nStark broadening in hydrogen can be estimated by the formula Δλ ≈ 10^-16 n_e^{2/3} λ². But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the impact approximation gives Δλ ≈ (e^2 n_e)/(4πε_0 m_e c) * λ^2. But this is getting complicated. Let me see. \n\nAnother approach: the electric field from neighboring ions. The electric field E due to a charge at distance r is E = e/(4πε_0 r²). The Stark shift is ΔE ≈ e E a_0, where a_0 is the Bohr radius. But this is a rough estimate. \n\nThe average distance between ions is r ≈ (n)^{-1/3} = (1e24 m^-3)^{-1/3} = 1e-8 m = 10 nm. \n\nElectric field from nearest neighbor: E ≈ e/(4πε_0 r²) ≈ (1.6e-19 C)/(4π*8.85e-12 * (1e-8)^2) ≈ 1.6e-19 / (1.11e-9 * 1e-16) ) = 1.6e-19 / 1.11e-25 ≈ 1.44e6 V/m. \n\nStark shift ΔE ≈ e E a_0. a_0 ≈ 5e-11 m. So ΔE ≈ 1.6e-19 C * 1.44e6 V/m * 5e-11 m ≈ 1.6e-19 * 1.44e6 *5e-11 ≈ 1.152e-23 J. Convert to eV: 1.152e-23 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 7.2e-5 eV. \n\nΔλ ≈ λ^2 ΔE/(hc). hc = 1240 eV nm. So Δλ ≈ (500 nm)^2 * 7.2e-5 eV / (1240 eV nm) = 250000 nm² * 7.2e-5 / 1240 nm ≈ (250000 * 7.2e-5) / 1240 nm ≈ (18) / 1240 ≈ 0.0145 nm. \n\nSo Stark broadening would be around 0.015 nm. Less than Doppler. \n\nAlternatively, if the dominant mechanism is Zeeman, but with B up to 1 T. Let's recalculate that. \n\nZeeman splitting ΔE = μ_B * B. For B=1 T, μ_B=9.27e-24 J/T. So ΔE=9.27e-24 J = 5.79e-5 eV. \n\nThe corresponding Δλ is (ΔE / E) * λ. E=2.5 eV. So (5.79e-5 / 2.5) * 500 nm ≈ (2.316e-5) * 500 ≈ 0.0116 nm. But if the magnetic field varies from 0 to 1 T, the total spread would be twice that, so Δλ ≈ 0.023 nm. \n\nComparing all three: Doppler ~0.05 nm, Zeeman ~0.023 nm, Stark ~0.015 nm, pressure ~0.002 nm. So Doppler is the largest. \n\nBut the problem says \"using order-of-magnitude estimates\". So if I choose Doppler, the answer is ~0.05 nm. But maybe the question expects a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the thermal motion leads to a larger broadening. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect the use of the formula Δλ ≈ λ * sqrt(2kT/mc²). Let's check that. \n\nsqrt(2kT/(mc²)) = sqrt(2*20 eV / (12 * 931 MeV/c² * c²)) ). Wait, m c² for carbon is 12 * 931 MeV = 11.17 GeV. So 2kT/(m c²) = 2*20 eV / 11.17e9 eV ≈ 40 / 1.117e10 ≈ 3.58e-9. sqrt(3.58e-9) ≈ 5.99e-5. Multiply by λ=500 nm: 500e-9 m *5.99e-5 ≈ 3e-11 m = 0.03 nm. \n\nSo around 0.03 nm. But earlier calculation with FWHM gave 0.05 nm. Depending on the formula, the answer varies. Since the problem says order-of-magnitude, 0.03-0.05 nm is acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let's think about the natural line width. But natural line width is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, where τ is the lifetime. But without knowing τ, we can't compute it. The problem states that when T, n, B are small, the width is natural, but here they are larger. So the answer for part (b) would be calculating one of the mechanisms. \n\nThe question says \"for one of these mechanisms\", so I can choose any. Let's pick Doppler broadening as it's straightforward. \n\nSo final answer for part (b) would be Δλ ≈ 0.05 nm. But let's check units. The wavelength is 500 nm, and the broadening is 0.05 nm, which is a significant width. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, if the ion temperature is 20 eV, but thermal motion leads to a certain Doppler shift. Let me confirm the calculation once more. \n\nGiven:\n\nλ = 500 nm = 500e-9 m\n\nhν = 2.5 eV → E = 2.5 eV\n\nkT = 20 eV (ion temperature)\n\nMass of C ion, m = 12 * 1.66e-27 kg = 1.99e-26 kg\n\nv_rms = sqrt(3kT/m) → since in 3D, the average velocity squared is 3kT/m. Wait, but for Doppler broadening, the component along the line of sight is sqrt(kT/m). So the RMS velocity in one direction is sqrt(kT/m). \n\nSo v = sqrt(kT/m) = sqrt(20 eV / (1.99e-26 kg)). Wait, need to convert eV to Joules. \n\n20 eV = 20 * 1.6e-19 J = 3.2e-18 J\n\nv = sqrt(3.2e-18 J / 1.99e-26 kg) = sqrt(1.608e8) ≈ 1.27e4 m/s\n\nΔλ/λ = v/c = 1.27e4 / 3e8 ≈ 4.23e-5\n\nΔλ = 500e-9 m * 4.23e-5 ≈ 2.115e-11 m ≈ 0.021 nm\n\nBut earlier calculation with FWHM gave 0.05 nm. The discrepancy comes from whether using sqrt(2kT/m) or sqrt(kT/m). The Doppler broadening formula for FWHM is Δλ = λ * sqrt( (8 ln 2 kT) / (m c²) )\n\nLet me compute that again:\n\n8 ln 2 ≈ 5.545\n\nkT = 20 eV = 3.2e-18 J\n\nm = 1.99e-26 kg\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nSo numerator: 5.545 * 3.2e-18 ≈ 1.774e-17\n\nDenominator: 1.99e-26 kg * (3e8)^2 = 1.99e-26 * 9e16 = 1.79e-9\n\nSo the ratio: 1.774e-17 / 1.79e-9 ≈ 9.91e-9\n\nSquare root: sqrt(9.91e-9) ≈ 9.96e-5\n\nMultiply by λ: 500e-9 m * 9.96e-5 ≈ 4.98e-11 m ≈ 0.05 nm. \n\nYes, so the FWHM is approximately 0.05 nm. \n\nSo the answer for part (b) would be Δλ ≈ 0.05 nm. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the answer in terms of Δλ ≈ 2 * v/c * λ, then it's 0.042 nm. But since the question allows order-of-magnitude, 0.05 nm is acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects a different mechanism, but since Doppler is the most straightforward and gives a reasonable value, I'll proceed with that. \n\nSo for part (a), the broadening mechanisms are Doppler, Stark, collisional (pressure), and Zeeman. For part (b), calculating Doppler gives Δλ ≈ 0.05 nm. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"order-of-magnitude estimates of needed parameters\". So maybe even approximate more. For example, using v ≈ sqrt(kT/m), where kT=20 eV, m=12u. \n\nBut 1 eV per u is about (1e6 eV/kg) since 1 u = 1.66e-27 kg. Wait, 1 eV/kg = 1.6e-19 J/kg. Not sure. Alternatively, thermal velocity v ≈ sqrt(kT/m). \n\nBut regardless, the calculation leads to Δλ ≈ 0.05 nm. \n\nAlternatively, if the answer is expected in terms of Δλ ≈ λ^2/(c) * sqrt(kT/m), but that's similar to what we did. \n\nYes, I think the answer is approximately 0.05 nm. So boxed as \\boxed{0.05 \\text{ nm}}.\n</think>\n\n(a) The observed spectral line broadening in the given conditions can be attributed to several mechanisms:  \n1. **Doppler Broadening**: Thermal motion of ions at high temperature (kT = 20 eV) causes shifts in emitted wavelengths due to the Doppler effect.  \n2. **Pressure (Collisional) Broadening**: High ion density (\\(n = 10^{24} \\, \\text{m}^{-3}\\)) leads to frequent collisions, shortening the excited state lifetime and broadening the line.  \n3. **Stark Broadening**: Electric fields from neighboring charged particles perturb energy levels, significant in high-density plasmas.  \n4. **Zeeman Broadening**: The non-uniform magnetic field (up to 1 T) causes varying shifts in energy levels, leading to a spread in wavelengths instead of distinct splitting.  \n\n(b) **Doppler Broadening Calculation**:  \nUsing the formula for Doppler full width at half maximum (FWHM):  \n\\[\n\\Delta\\lambda = \\lambda \\sqrt{\\frac{8 \\ln 2 \\cdot kT}{m c^2}}\n\\]\n- \\(\\lambda = 500 \\, \\text{nm}\\), \\(kT = 20 \\, \\text{eV} = 3.2 \\times 10^{-18} \\, \\text{J}\\)  \n- \\(m = 12 \\times 1.66 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\text{kg} = 1.99 \\times 10^{-26} \\, \\text{kg}\\)  \n- \\(c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)  \n\nSubstituting values:  \n\\[\n\\Delta\\lambda \\approx 500 \\, \\text{nm} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{8 \\ln 2 \\cdot 3.2 \\times 10^{-18}}{1.99 \\times 10^{-26} \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8)^2}} \\approx 0.05 \\, \\text{nm}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer**:  \n(a) Broadening mechanisms include Doppler, collisional, Stark, and Zeeman effects.  \n(b) Doppler broadening gives:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{0.05 \\, \\text{nm}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["0.05 \\text{ nm}", "0.05 \\, \\text{nm}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "0.05 \\text{ nm}", "expr2": "\\Gamma_D = 2 \\, \\text{cm}^{-1}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "0.05 \\, \\text{nm}", "expr2": "\\Gamma_D = 2 \\, \\text{cm}^{-1}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/3-2", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The question is about why the electrostatic force between the Earth and the Moon can be ignored. The options are (a) because it's much smaller than the gravitational force, (b) because the bodies are electrically neutral, and (c) because of the tidal effect.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics of gravitational and electrostatic forces. Gravitational force is what keeps the Moon in orbit around the Earth. Electrostatic force, on the other hand, depends on the charges of the objects. Coulomb's law and Newton's law of gravitation are similar in their inverse-square dependence on distance, but they differ in the constants and the properties they depend on—charge for Coulomb and mass for gravity.\n\nOption (b) says it's because the bodies are electrically neutral. If both the Earth and the Moon are neutral, meaning their net charge is zero, then the electrostatic force between them would indeed be negligible. Because Coulomb's law requires charges to exert forces. If both have no net charge, the force would be zero or very small. But wait, even if they were slightly charged, maybe due to some ionospheric effects or solar wind, the charges might not be exactly zero. But in reality, celestial bodies like Earth and Moon are mostly neutral. So maybe (b) is correct.\n\nOption (a) claims the electrostatic force is much smaller than gravitational. Let's think. Suppose both bodies had some charge. How would the forces compare? Let's do a rough calculation. Let's assume both Earth and Moon have a charge Q. The gravitational force is F_grav = G * M_e * M_m / r². The electrostatic force is F_elec = k_e * Q² / r². The ratio F_elec / F_grav = (k_e Q²) / (G M_e M_m). For this ratio to be very small, even if there's some charge, the product k_e Q² must be much less than G M_e M_m. Let's plug in numbers. G is ~6.67e-11 N m²/kg². k_e is ~8.99e9 N m²/C². Mass of Earth ~6e24 kg, Moon ~7e22 kg. Let's suppose Q is some charge. Let's see what Q would make F_elec comparable to F_grav. Let's set F_elec = F_grav. Then k_e Q² = G M_e M_m. Solving for Q: Q = sqrt( G M_e M_m / k_e ). Plugging numbers: sqrt( (6.67e-11)(6e24)(7e22) / 8.99e9 ). Let's compute numerator: 6.67e-11 * 6e24 = 6.67*6=40.02e13, then 40.02e13 *7e22 = 280.14e35. So numerator is ~2.8e37. Divide by 8.99e9: ~3.11e27. Take square root: ~5.58e13 C. So Q would need to be about 5.6e13 Coulombs each for the forces to be equal. That's a huge charge. But in reality, how much charge do Earth and Moon have? The Earth's net charge is not zero, but it's negligible. For example, the Earth's surface has a fair weather electric field of about 100 V/m pointing downward. Integrating over the Earth's surface (radius ~6.4e6 m), the surface charge density sigma = epsilon_0 * E. E=100 V/m, so sigma = 8.85e-12 *100 ≈ 8.85e-10 C/m². Total charge Q = sigma * 4 pi R². 4 pi R² is Earth's surface area. R=6.4e6 m. Area ≈ 4*3.14*(6.4e6)^2 ≈ 5.15e14 m². So Q ≈ 8.85e-10 *5.15e14 ≈ 4.56e5 C. So Earth's charge is about 456,000 C. Let's compare to the 5.6e13 C needed for F_elec to be equal to F_grav. 4.56e5 is way smaller than 5.6e13. So even if Earth had that charge, the ratio F_elec/F_grav would be (Q_earth * Q_moon)/(5.6e13)^2. If both have 4.56e5 C, then (4.56e5)^2 / (5.6e13)^2 = (2e11)/(3.1e27) ≈ 6.45e-17. So F_elec would be 6e-17 times F_grav. So even with that charge, it's negligible. But wait, maybe the actual charges are even smaller. So even if the Earth and Moon had some net charge, the electrostatic force would still be negligible compared to gravity. Therefore, the reason we can ignore it is either because the charges are neutral (b) or because even if they have some charge, the force is much smaller (a). But the question is why we can ignore it. If the bodies are neutral (b), then the electrostatic force is zero. If they have some charge but it's negligible compared to gravity (a), then (a) is the reason. So which is the correct answer?\n\nWait, the question says \"can be ignored\". If the bodies are neutral, then the electrostatic force is zero, so that's a better reason. But if they are not perfectly neutral, but the charge is so small that the force is negligible compared to gravity, then (a) is the reason. So which is the case?\n\nIn reality, celestial bodies like Earth and Moon are mostly neutral, but there might be some charge separation. However, the main reason is that they are neutral. Because if they were highly charged, even if the force was smaller than gravity, but not negligible, we might still have to consider it. But the fact that they are neutral (or nearly neutral) makes the electrostatic force negligible. So (b) is the correct answer. Because if they were charged, even a little, but (a) says it's because the force is smaller. But the primary reason is that they are neutral. For example, if two objects are neutral, regardless of the relative strengths of the forces, there's no electrostatic force. So (b) is the correct answer. Because the premise is that the electrostatic force is zero (or nearly zero) because the net charge is zero. So (b) is the reason. Therefore, the answer is (b).\n</think>\n\nThe electrostatic force between the Earth and the Moon can be ignored primarily because both celestial bodies are electrically neutral. While gravitational force depends on mass and is always attractive, electrostatic force requires net charges to exist. Even if slight charges were present due to environmental factors (e.g., ionospheric effects), the resulting electrostatic force would still be negligible compared to gravity. However, the fundamental reason is that the Earth and Moon are neutral overall, leading to no significant net charge to generate an electrostatic force. \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["B"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "B", "expr2": "b"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "B", "expr2": "b"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/4-24", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these three physics problems one by one. I need to determine if each process is possible or impossible based on the laws of physics, probably conservation laws and quantum mechanics principles. Let me start with part (a).\n\n(a) A single photon strikes a stationary electron and gives up all its energy to the electron.\n\nHmm, so a photon colliding with an electron. I remember that in the Compton effect, a photon transfers some of its energy to an electron, changing its wavelength. But here, the question is if the photon can give all its energy to the electron. Wait, but for that to happen, the photon would have to be completely absorbed, right? But electrons can't just absorb a photon entirely because of conservation laws. Let me think about momentum conservation.\n\nIn the initial state, the electron is stationary, so its momentum is zero. The photon has momentum p_photon = E/c in the direction of its motion. After the collision, if the photon gives all its energy to the electron, the electron would have momentum p_electron. But before collision, the total momentum is just the photon's momentum. After, the electron must have that same momentum. However, the energy of the photon is E_photon = pc, and the electron's energy after would be sqrt( (pc)^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 ) = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m^2 c^4 ). But the energy given by the photon is pc, so setting them equal:\n\npc = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 ) - mc^2 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the electron is initially at rest, so its initial energy is mc². After absorbing the photon, its energy would be E_electron = gamma mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. The photon's energy is hf. So energy conservation would require:\n\nhf + mc² = gamma mc²\n\nMomentum conservation: the photon's momentum hf/c must equal the electron's momentum after, which is gamma m v.\n\nBut if the photon is absorbed, then the electron's momentum p = hf/c. Let's write the equations.\n\nLet me denote the photon's energy as E_photon = hf, momentum p_photon = E_photon / c.\n\nElectron's rest mass energy is mc². After collision, the electron's total energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ), and momentum p_e = p_photon.\n\nSo substituting p_e = E_photon / c into the energy equation:\n\nE = sqrt( (E_photon)^2 + (mc²)^2 )\n\nBut according to energy conservation:\n\nE_photon + mc² = sqrt( (E_photon)^2 + (mc²)^2 )\n\nLet me square both sides to check:\n\n(E_photon + mc²)^2 = (E_photon)^2 + (mc²)^2\n\nExpanding left side: E_photon² + 2 E_photon mc² + m²c^4 = E_photon² + m²c^4\n\nSubtract E_photon² + m²c^4 from both sides:\n\n2 E_photon mc² = 0\n\nWhich implies E_photon = 0, but that's impossible because a photon with zero energy doesn't exist. Therefore, this equation can't hold. So the process is impossible because it violates conservation of energy and momentum. Therefore, part (a) is impossible.\n\nMoving on to (b): A single photon in empty space is transformed into an electron and a positron.\n\nThis sounds like pair production. I know that pair production (creating electron-positron pair) usually requires a photon interacting with a nucleus or something to conserve momentum. Because if a photon converts into an electron and positron, their combined rest mass is 2m_e c². The photon must have energy at least that, so energy threshold. But even if the photon has enough energy, can it happen in empty space?\n\nLet's consider conservation laws. Energy: photon's energy must be at least 2m_e c². Momentum: photon's momentum is E/c. The electron and positron would have to have equal and opposite momenta if they are produced at rest relative to each other, but their total momentum would be zero. However, the photon's momentum is E/c. So if the photon converts into the pair, the total momentum after would have to be E/c. But if the pair is produced, their combined momentum would need to equal the photon's momentum. However, if the photon is in empty space, there's no other object to take away momentum. Let's check.\n\nSuppose the photon has energy E and momentum p = E/c. After the conversion, the electron and positron must have total momentum p. Let's assume they move in the same direction as the photon. But their rest mass requires that their energies are each at least m_e c². The total energy would be more than 2m_e c², which must equal the photon's energy. But even if energy is sufficient, the problem is with momentum.\n\nLet me compute the minimum photon energy required for pair production. In the center-of-momentum frame, but since the photon is moving, maybe in a frame where the total momentum is p_photon. Wait, but pair production in a vacuum can't conserve both energy and momentum. Because if the photon's momentum is p, then the electron and positron must have total momentum p. Let's denote their momenta as p1 and p2, so p1 + p2 = p. Their energies would be sqrt( (p1 c)^2 + (m_e c²)^2 ) and similarly for p2. The total energy would be sum of those two, which must equal E_photon = pc.\n\nBut let's see if this is possible. Let's suppose the electron and positron are moving in the same direction as the photon. Then p1 and p2 are in the same direction. Let's take p1 = p2 = p/2. Then each has momentum p/2. Their energies would each be sqrt( ( (p/2) c )^2 + (m_e c²)^2 ). The total energy would be 2 * sqrt( ( (p c / 2 )^2 + (m_e c²)^2 ) ). But the photon's energy is pc. So set:\n\n2 * sqrt( ( (p c / 2 )^2 + (m_e c²)^2 ) ) = p c\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n4 * ( (p² c² / 4 ) + m_e² c^4 ) = p² c²\n\nSimplify:\n\np² c² + 4 m_e² c^4 = p² c²\n\nSubtract p² c² from both sides:\n\n4 m_e² c^4 = 0\n\nWhich is impossible. Therefore, even if the photon has enough energy, the momentum conservation can't be satisfied. Therefore, pair production cannot occur in empty space; it requires another particle (like a nucleus) to take away some momentum. Hence, part (b) is impossible.\n\nNow part (c): A fast positron and a stationary electron annihilate, producing only one photon.\n\nElectron-positron annihilation usually produces two photons to conserve momentum. If they produce only one photon, let's check conservation laws.\n\nInitially, the positron is moving (fast), and the electron is stationary. Let's denote the positron's momentum as p, and the electron's momentum is zero. So total initial momentum is p. After annihilation, there's one photon with momentum p_photon. Conservation of momentum requires p_photon = p. The energy of the photon would be E_photon = |p_photon| c.\n\nBut the initial energy is the sum of the positron's energy and the electron's rest energy. The positron's energy is gamma m c², where gamma is its Lorentz factor. The electron's energy is m c². So total energy is (gamma + 1) m c². The photon's energy must equal this: E_photon = (gamma + 1) m c². But E_photon is also |p| c. The positron's momentum is gamma m v. Let's relate p (positron's momentum) to gamma.\n\nFor a relativistic particle, p = gamma m v. And energy E = gamma m c². So v = (p c²)/(gamma m c²) ) = (p c)/(gamma m). Hmm, maybe better to use the relation E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². For the positron, E = gamma m c², so (gamma m c²)^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. Therefore, p = sqrt( gamma² - 1 ) m c.\n\nSo the photon's energy is E_photon = p c = sqrt( gamma² - 1 ) m c². But the total energy is (gamma + 1) m c². So setting:\n\nsqrt( gamma² - 1 ) m c² = (gamma + 1) m c²\n\nDivide both sides by m c²:\n\nsqrt( gamma² - 1 ) = gamma + 1\n\nSquare both sides:\n\ngamma² - 1 = gamma² + 2 gamma + 1\n\nSimplify:\n\n-1 = 2 gamma + 1\n\n=> 2 gamma = -2\n\ngamma = -1\n\nBut gamma is always positive (since it's 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)), so this is impossible. Therefore, there's no solution. Hence, producing a single photon would violate conservation of momentum and energy. Therefore, part (c) is impossible.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\n(a) Impossible\n\n(b) Impossible\n\n(c) Impossible\n</think>\n\n(a) A single photon cannot transfer all its energy to a stationary electron due to conservation laws. Momentum conservation requires the electron's final momentum to equal the photon's initial momentum. However, energy conservation leads to a contradiction unless the photon has zero energy, which is impossible. Thus, this process is **impossible**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Impossible}}\n\\]\n\n(b) A photon cannot spontaneously transform into an electron-positron pair in empty space. Pair production requires a third particle (e.g., a nucleus) to conserve momentum. Without it, the photon's momentum cannot match the combined momentum of the electron and positron, violating conservation laws. Thus, this process is **impossible**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Impossible}}\n\\]\n\n(c) Electron-positron annihilation producing a single photon violates momentum and energy conservation. Annihilation typically emits two photons to balance momentum. For one photon, solving the conservation equations leads to unphysical results (e.g., negative gamma). Thus, this process is **impossible**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Impossible}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Impossible}", "\\text{Impossible}", "\\text{Impossible}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Impossible}", "expr2": "\\text{Impossible}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Impossible}", "expr2": "\\text{Impossible}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Impossible}", "expr2": "\\text{Impossible}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-8", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle each of these physics terms one by one. I need to remember what each effect or rule is about. Let me start with the Auger effect. Hmm, I think the Auger effect has something to do with electrons. Oh right, when an electron is removed from an inner shell, another electron drops down to fill the vacancy, and instead of emitting an X-ray, the energy is transferred to another electron which gets ejected. That's the Auger effect. So it's a process where an atom emits an electron instead of a photon.\n\nNext is the Anomalous Zeeman effect. I remember the Zeeman effect is the splitting of spectral lines in a magnetic field. The normal Zeeman effect is when the splitting is into three lines, which happens when the spin is zero. But the anomalous Zeeman effect is when the splitting is into more lines, which occurs when electron spin is considered. So it's due to the interaction of the magnetic field with both the orbital and spin angular momentum of the electrons, leading to more complex splitting patterns.\n\nThe Lamb shift. Oh, that's from quantum electrodynamics. It's the small energy difference between the 2S and 2P orbitals in hydrogen, which according to the Dirac equation should have the same energy. But experiments by Lamb and Retherford showed a slight shift, which was explained by the vacuum fluctuations in QED. So the Lamb shift is the deviation from expected energy levels due to quantum fluctuations and the electron's interaction with the quantized electromagnetic field.\n\nLandé interval rule. This has to do with the fine structure of atomic spectra. The rule states that the energy difference between two adjacent levels in a multiplet is proportional to the larger of the two total angular momentum values involved. So for a given multiplet, the spacing between levels J and J-1 is proportional to J. This helps in determining the splitting of energy levels due to spin-orbit interaction.\n\nHund's rules for atomic levels. There are three rules. The first is about maximum total spin S, so electrons fill orbitals to maximize parallel spins. The second is maximum orbital angular momentum L for that spin. The third is about the total angular momentum J: if the shell is less than half full, J is L-S; if more than half, J is L+S. These rules determine the ground state term of an atom based on electron configuration.\n</think>\n\n(a) **Auger Effect**: A process where an electron from a higher energy level fills a vacancy in an inner shell, transferring energy to another electron (Auger electron) that is ejected from the atom instead of emitting a photon.  \n\n(b) **Anomalous Zeeman Effect**: The splitting of atomic spectral lines into multiple components under a magnetic field, caused by the interaction of both orbital and spin angular momenta of electrons.

{"id": "atomic/3-34", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The question is about determining the strangeness, hypercharge, and isospin of the Y₁* particle based on the given decay modes. \n\nSo, Y₁* decays into Λ⁰ and π⁺, and also into Λ⁰ and π⁻. Since these are strong decays (because the problem mentions \"strong decay modes\" in part c), the quantum numbers should be conserved in the decay process. \n\nFirst, let's recall the quantum numbers of the particles involved. \n\nThe Λ⁰ is a strange baryon with strangeness S = -1. Its quark composition is uds, so charge Q = 0. For hypercharge Y, which is defined as Y = B + S, where B is the baryon number. Λ⁰ has B = 1, so Y = 1 + (-1) = 0. \n\nThe pion π⁺ has quark composition u anti-d. Pions are mesons with B = 0. The strangeness S of pions is 0. So hypercharge Y for π⁺ would be Y = B + S = 0 + 0 = 0. Similarly, π⁻ is d anti-u, also S=0, Y=0. \n\nNow, the Y₁* decays into Λ⁰ + π⁺. Let's check the quantum numbers. \n\nThe initial particle Y₁* must have the same quantum numbers as the sum of the decay products. \n\nFor strangeness: Λ⁰ has S = -1, π⁺ has S = 0. So total S = -1. Therefore, Y₁* must have S = -1. \n\nHypercharge Y: For Λ⁰, Y = 0 (as calculated earlier), π⁺ Y = 0. So total Y = 0 + 0 = 0. Therefore, Y₁* must have Y = 0. \n\nIsospin is a bit trickier. Let's recall that pions form an isospin triplet: π⁺, π⁰, π⁻ with I = 1 and I₃ = +1, 0, -1 respectively. The Λ⁰ is an isosinglet, meaning it has I = 0. \n\nSo in the decay Y₁* → Λ⁰ + π⁺, the isospin of the products is the combination of I = 0 (Λ⁰) and I = 1 (π⁺). The total isospin can be 1 (since 0 + 1 = 1). Therefore, the Y₁* must have isospin I = 1. \n\nWait, but how do we know that the combination is I=1? Because when combining two particles, their isospins add vectorially. If one has I=0 and the other I=1, the total isospin is just 1. So the Y₁* must have I=1. \n\nSimilarly, for the decay into Λ⁰ + π⁻, the pion here is I₃ = -1. The Λ⁰ has I₃ = 0. So the total I₃ of the products is -1. Therefore, the Y₁* must have I₃ = -1. But since the Y₁* has I=1, the I₃ can be -1, 0, +1. However, in the first decay, the pion is π⁺ (I₃=+1), so the Y₁* in that case would have I₃=+1. But wait, the problem states that the same Y₁* is seen in both Λ⁰ π⁺ and Λ⁰ π⁻ invariant mass spectra. That suggests that the Y₁* has isospin I=1 with different I₃ components. But since the reaction is K⁻ + p → Y₁* → Λ⁰ + π⁺ + π⁻, perhaps the Y₁* is part of an isospin multiplet. However, the problem states that the Y₁* is a single particle, so maybe it's an isotriplet? Wait, but the question is about the Y₁* particle's quantum numbers. Since both decay channels (Λ⁰ π⁺ and Λ⁰ π⁻) show a peak, that suggests that the Y₁* can decay into both, which would require that the Y₁* has I=1, with different members of the triplet decaying into different charge states. But the problem says \"the same reaction (but different events)\", so maybe the Y₁* is part of an isospin triplet, and different members decay into Λ⁰ π⁺ or Λ⁰ π⁻. However, the problem refers to Y₁* as a single particle, so perhaps the Y₁* has I=1, and the two decay modes correspond to different I₃ components. But since the question is about the quantum numbers of Y₁*, which would be the same for all members of the isospin multiplet except I₃. But the problem doesn't specify which member, so perhaps we just need to give the isospin I=1. \n\nSo summarizing: Strangeness S = -1 (from Λ⁰ S=-1 and pion S=0), Hypercharge Y = 0 (since Λ⁰ Y=0 and pion Y=0), and Isospin I=1 (since pion has I=1 and Λ⁰ I=0, so total I=1). \n\nMoving to part (b): The products Λ⁰ and π⁺ from Y₁* are in a relative p-state (angular momentum l=1). We need to find possible spin assignments J for Y₁* and its intrinsic parity. \n\nThe spin of Y₁* is determined by combining the spins of Λ⁰ and π⁺, plus the orbital angular momentum l=1. \n\nThe Λ⁰ has spin J=1/2 (since it's a baryon, like the proton and neutron which have spin 1/2). The pion π⁺ has spin J=0 (since pions are pseudoscalar mesons, spin 0). So the total spin of the decay products is from combining J_Λ = 1/2 and J_π = 0, which gives total spin S = 1/2. Then, the orbital angular momentum l=1 must be added to this. So the possible total angular momentum J can be |S - l| to S + l. Since S=1/2 and l=1, the possible J values are |1/2 -1| = 1/2 and 1/2 +1 = 3/2. Therefore, the possible J for Y₁* are 1/2 and 3/2. \n\nBut wait, the total angular momentum J of the parent particle (Y₁*) must equal the sum of the spins of the decay products plus their orbital angular momentum. Since the decay is a strong interaction process, angular momentum is conserved. So the spin of Y₁* (J) must be equal to the vector sum of the spins of Λ⁰ (1/2) and π⁺ (0) plus the orbital angular momentum l=1. \n\nBut since the pion has spin 0, the total spin of the two particles is just the spin of Λ⁰, which is 1/2. Then, adding the orbital angular momentum l=1, the possible total J is 1/2 ± 1, which gives 1/2 and 3/2. Therefore, possible J values for Y₁* are 1/2 and 3/2. \n\nNow, the intrinsic parity. The intrinsic parity of the Y₁* is determined by the product of the intrinsic parities of the decay products and the parity associated with the orbital angular momentum. \n\nThe parity for orbital angular momentum l is (-1)^l. Here, l=1, so that's (-1)^1 = -1. \n\nThe intrinsic parity of Λ⁰ is given as +, and the pion has intrinsic parity -. So the product of intrinsic parities is (+)*(-) = -1. \n\nTherefore, the parity of Y₁* (P) must satisfy: \n\nP(Y₁*) = P(Λ⁰) * P(π⁺) * (-1)^l \n\nPlugging in the values: \n\nP(Y₁*) = (+1) * (-1) * (-1)^1 = (+1)*(-1)*(-1) = (+1)*(1) = +1 \n\nWait, let's compute that again. \n\nP(Y₁*) = P(Λ⁰) * P(π) * (-1)^l \n\nP(Λ⁰) = +1 \n\nP(π) = -1 \n\nl=1, so (-1)^1 = -1 \n\nSo: \n\nP(Y₁*) = (+1) * (-1) * (-1) = (+1) * (1) = +1 \n\nTherefore, the intrinsic parity of Y₁* is +1. \n\nSo possible spins are J = 1/2 or 3/2, and parity +. \n\nBut wait, the question says \"What spin assignments J are possible for the Y₁*?\" So the possible J values are 1/2 and 3/2. \n\nFor part (c): Other strong decay modes. Since strong decays conserve isospin, strangeness, etc., we need to see what other combinations of particles could have the same quantum numbers as Y₁*. \n\nY₁* has S=-1, Y=0, I=1. Let's check Y= B + S. Since Y=0, and S=-1, then B must be 1 (since Y = B + S => 0 = B + (-1) => B=1). So Y₁* is a baryon with B=1, S=-1, I=1. \n\nPossible decay modes must be into other hadrons with the same quantum numbers. The current decay modes are Λ⁰ π⁺ and Λ⁰ π⁻. Are there other particles that can combine to give S=-1, Y=0, I=1? \n\nLet's think. For example, Σ particles. The Σ⁺, Σ⁰, Σ⁻ have S=-1, I=1. For example, Σ⁺ has quark content uus, Σ⁰ uds, Σ⁻ dds. Their hypercharge Y = B + S = 1 + (-1) = 0. So Σ particles have S=-1, Y=0, I=1. So Y₁* could decay into Σ and a pion? Wait, but Σ has I=1, and pion has I=1. Let's see: \n\nIf Y₁* (I=1) decays into Σ (I=1) and pion (I=1), the total isospin would be combining I=1 and I=1. The possible total I could be 0,1,2. But Y₁* has I=1, so the decay products must combine to I=1. \n\nBut let's check the quantum numbers. For example, Y₁* → Σ⁰ + π⁰. Let's check S: Σ⁰ has S=-1, π⁰ S=0. Total S=-1, which matches. Hypercharge Y: Σ⁰ Y=0, π⁰ Y=0. Total Y=0. Isospin: Σ is I=1, pion I=1. The combination could have I=1. So this is possible. \n\nAlternatively, Y₁* → Σ⁺ + π⁻, or Σ⁻ + π⁺. Let's check Σ⁺ + π⁻: Σ⁺ has S=-1, π⁻ S=0. Total S=-1. Σ⁺ has Y=0, π⁻ Y=0. Total Y=0. Isospin: Σ⁺ is part of I=1 triplet (I₃=+1), π⁻ is I=1 (I₃=-1). The combination could have I=1. So this is another possible decay mode. \n\nSimilarly, Σ⁻ + π⁺ would also work. \n\nTherefore, other strong decay modes could be Y₁* → Σ + π. \n\nAlternatively, maybe other combinations like Λ⁰ + π⁰? Wait, but Λ⁰ has I=0, π⁰ has I=1, I₃=0. The total isospin would be I=1 (since Λ⁰ is I=0 and π⁰ is I=1). So Y₁* (I=1) could decay into Λ⁰ + π⁰. But in the problem, they mentioned that the Λ⁰ π⁺ and Λ⁰ π⁻ spectra show peaks, but maybe Λ⁰ π⁰ is another possible decay. However, the problem states that the same reaction (but different events) shows similar peaks for Λ⁰ π⁻. Wait, the reaction given is K⁻ + p → Λ⁰ + π⁺ + π⁻. So in some events, you look at Λ⁰ π⁺ invariant mass, others Λ⁰ π⁻. But if Y₁* can decay into Λ⁰ π⁰, then in the reaction products, you would have Λ⁰ and π⁰, but the reaction given has π⁺ and π⁻. So maybe the decay Y₁* → Λ⁰ π⁰ is possible, but in the given reaction, there's no π⁰ produced. Wait, the reaction is K⁻ + p → Λ⁰ + π⁺ + π⁻. So the products are Λ⁰, π⁺, π⁻. So if Y₁* is produced, it could decay into Λ⁰ π⁺ or Λ⁰ π⁻, but also if there's a decay into Λ⁰ π⁰, but since there's no π⁰ in the final state, that decay wouldn't be observed here. Therefore, the other decay modes would require different final states. But the question is about other strong decay modes in general, not necessarily visible in this particular reaction. \n\nSo possible other decay modes are Y₁* → Σ + π. For example, Σ⁺ π⁻, Σ⁻ π⁺, Σ⁰ π⁰. These conserve the quantum numbers. Let's check: \n\nFor Σ⁺ π⁻: \n\nΣ⁺ has S=-1, π⁻ S=0 → total S=-1. \n\nΣ⁺ Y=0, π⁻ Y=0 → total Y=0. \n\nIsospin: Σ⁺ is I=1, I₃=+1; π⁻ is I=1, I₃=-1. The combination can have I=1 (since 1⊗1 can give I=1). So this is allowed. \n\nSimilarly for Σ⁻ π⁺. \n\nΣ⁰ π⁰: Σ⁰ has I₃=0, π⁰ I₃=0. Total I₃=0, which is part of I=1. \n\nTherefore, these are possible decay modes. \n\nAlternatively, could it decay into other hyperons and kaons? Let's see. For example, Y₁* → K + something? Let's check quantum numbers. \n\nSuppose Y₁* → K⁺ + neutron. K⁺ has S=+1, neutron S=0. Total S=+1. But Y₁* has S=-1, so that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, Y₁* → K⁻ + proton. K⁻ has S=-1, proton S=0. Total S=-1. Y would be: K⁻ Y = B + S = 0 + (-1) = -1. Proton Y = 1 + 0 = 1. Total Y = -1 +1 = 0. Isospin: K⁻ is part of isospin I=1/2 (since kaons are I=1/2), proton is I=1/2. Combining I=1/2 and I=1/2 can give I=0 or I=1. Y₁* has I=1, so possible. But wait, the decay would need to conserve isospin. The initial Y₁* has I=1. The products K⁻ (I=1/2, I₃=-1/2) and proton (I=1/2, I₃=+1/2). The combination of I=1/2 and I=1/2 can give I=1 (if they are in a symmetric state). So if the combination has I=1, then this decay is possible. \n\nBut let's check the quantum numbers again. Y₁* has S=-1, Y=0. \n\nK⁻ has S=-1, Y = B + S = 0 + (-1) = -1. Proton has S=0, Y=1. So total Y = -1 +1 = 0. S = -1 +0 = -1. So that matches. Isospin: K⁻ is in the anti-doublet (strangeness -1), so for kaons, K⁺ is (I=1/2, I₃=+1/2), K⁰ is (I=1/2, I₃=-1/2). The anti-kaons are K⁻ (I=1/2, I₃=-1/2) and K⁰-bar (I=1/2, I₃=+1/2). So K⁻ has I=1/2, I₃=-1/2. Proton is I=1/2, I₃=+1/2. Combining these two gives possible I=0 or I=1. Since Y₁* has I=1, the decay into K⁻ + p would require the combination to have I=1. So this is possible. \n\nTherefore, another possible strong decay mode is Y₁* → K⁻ + p. Wait, but wait, the original reaction is K⁻ + p → Y₁* + ... So maybe Y₁* can decay back into K⁻ + p? But that would be a different process. However, in general, strong decay modes are allowed if they conserve the quantum numbers. \n\nBut let's check if K⁻ + p is a possible decay. The Y₁* has B=1 (since it's a baryon, as hypercharge Y=0 = B + S, S=-1 ⇒ B=1). So decay into K⁻ (B=0) + proton (B=1) would have total B=1, which is conserved. \n\nSo yes, Y₁* → K⁻ + p is another possible strong decay mode. \n\nSimilarly, Y₁* could decay into other combinations like Σ⁰ + π⁰, Σ⁺ + π⁻, Σ⁻ + π⁺, or K⁻ + p, etc. \n\nBut the problem says \"other strong decay modes do you expect\", so besides Λπ, Σπ and Kp are possibilities. \n\nBut wait, the Σπ decay is more likely because Σ and π are both I=1, so combining to I=1. Whereas Kp would require combining I=1/2 (K) and I=1/2 (p) to get I=1. \n\nSo both are possible. Therefore, the answer for part (c) would include decays into Σπ and Kp. \n\nBut let me verify the quantum numbers again for K⁻ + p: \n\nY₁* has S=-1, Y=0. \n\nK⁻: S=-1, Y= B + S = 0 + (-1) = -1. \n\nProton: S=0, Y=1. \n\nTotal S: -1 +0 = -1. \n\nTotal Y: -1 +1 = 0. \n\nIsospin: K⁻ is I=1/2, proton I=1/2. Combining them can give I=0 or I=1. Since Y₁* has I=1, the decay is allowed if the combination is I=1. \n\nTherefore, Y₁* → K⁻ + p is a possible decay mode. \n\nSimilarly, Y₁* → K⁰-bar + n (neutron). Let's check: \n\nK⁰-bar: S=-1, Y= -1 (B=0, S=-1). \n\nNeutron: S=0, Y=1 (B=1, S=0). \n\nTotal S=-1, Y=0. \n\nIsospin: K⁰-bar is I=1/2, I₃=+1/2. Neutron is I=1/2, I₃=-1/2. Combining to I=1 (if I₃=+1/2 + (-1/2) = 0, which is part of I=1 triplet). So yes, possible. \n\nTherefore, other decay modes are Σπ and K N (kaon + nucleon). \n\nBut in the original decay, Y₁* is produced in K⁻ + p → Λ⁰ + π⁺ + π⁻. So if Y₁* decays into K⁻ + p, that would be a different channel. \n\nBut the question is about other strong decay modes expected. So the answer should include Σπ and K N channels. \n\nBut wait, the Σπ decay is more likely because the Σ is a hyperon with the same S=-1 as Y₁*, and combining with pion (S=0) gives the same S. Whereas K N requires combining S=-1 (K) and S=0 (N) to get S=-1. Both are possible. \n\nTherefore, the other strong decay modes are Y₁* → Σ + π and Y₁* → K + N. \n\nBut I need to confirm if these are allowed by conservation laws. Since strong interactions conserve isospin, strangeness, etc., but wait, in strong interactions, strangeness is not conserved. Wait, no: in strong interactions, strangeness is conserved. Wait, no! Wait, in strong interactions, strangeness is conserved only if the particles are interacting via the strong force. But in reality, strange particles can decay via the strong force only if the interaction conserves strangeness. Wait, no. Wait, the strong force does not conserve strangeness. The strong force is mediated by gluons, which do not change flavor. So in strong interactions, strangeness is conserved. Wait, but actually, the strong interaction can change strangeness if there is a s quark involved. Wait, no. The strong interaction is flavor-blind. So interactions via the strong force do not change flavor, hence strangeness is conserved. Therefore, in strong decays, strangeness must be conserved. \n\nWait, but wait, the Y₁* has S=-1. If it decays via the strong force into Σ + π, then Σ has S=-1 and π has S=0, so total S=-1. So that's conserved. Similarly, if it decays into K⁻ (S=-1) + p (S=0), total S=-1. So that's conserved. Therefore, both decays are allowed. \n\nBut wait, the Σ has S=-1, same as Y₁*, so that's allowed. The K⁻ has S=-1, so that's also allowed. Therefore, both decay modes conserve strangeness. \n\nTherefore, the answer to part (c) is that other strong decay modes include Σπ and K N (kaon-nucleon) channels. \n\nBut let me check standard particles. The Σ(1385) is a known particle, which is a spin-3/2 resonance that decays into Λπ and Σπ. So yes, the Σπ decay is a standard decay mode. Similarly, the K N decay might be possible but perhaps phase space or other factors make it less likely.

{"id": "atomic/4-23", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the range of kinetic energy T for which a beam of π⁺ mesons can produce μ⁺ particles moving backward. The reaction is π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν. The masses are given: m_π c² is 139.57 MeV, m_μ c² is 105.66 MeV, and the neutrino mass is 0. Let me start by recalling some physics concepts here.\n\nFirst, this is a decay process. The pion at rest would decay into a muon and a neutrino. But in this case, the pion is moving with some kinetic energy T. The problem states that some muons are going backward relative to the pion's direction of motion. So, in the lab frame (where the pion is moving), the muon is emitted in the opposite direction. I need to find the minimum kinetic energy T of the pion required for this to happen.\n\nHmm. When particles decay, the products are emitted isotropically in the rest frame of the parent particle. But when the parent is moving, there's a Lorentz transformation to the lab frame. The direction of the decay products in the lab frame depends on the parent's velocity and the emission angle in the rest frame.\n\nFor a muon to be moving backward in the lab frame, its velocity in the pion's rest frame must be such that when we boost to the lab frame (where the pion is moving), the muon's direction reverses. This probably involves relativistic velocity addition. Let me think.\n\nIn the pion's rest frame, the muon and neutrino are emitted in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Let's denote the pion's rest frame as S', and the lab frame as S. The pion is moving with velocity v in the lab frame S. The muon is emitted at some angle in S', but when transformed to S, it ends up moving opposite to the pion's direction.\n\nTo find the condition where the muon is moving backward in the lab frame, we need to find the pion's velocity (or equivalently, its kinetic energy) such that the muon's velocity in the lab frame is negative (opposite to the pion's motion).\n\nLet me recall the relativistic velocity transformation. If a particle has velocity u' in the S' frame (which is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame S), then its velocity in S is:\n\nu = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²)\n\nBut since we're dealing with high-energy physics, maybe I should work in natural units where c=1. That might simplify equations. Let's do that.\n\nSo, in the pion rest frame (S'), the muon and neutrino are emitted with some momenta. Let's denote the pion's rest frame. In that frame, the pion is at rest, so its energy is m_π c² (which is 139.57 MeV). The muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Let's denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum in S' as p'. Then the neutrino's momentum is also p' but in the opposite direction.\n\nThe energy of the muon in S' is sqrt(p'² + m_μ²), and the energy of the neutrino is p' (since m_ν = 0). The total energy must equal the pion's rest energy:\n\nsqrt(p'² + m_μ²) + p' = m_π\n\nLet me solve for p'. Let's write the equation:\n\nsqrt(p'² + m_μ²) = m_π - p'\n\nSquare both sides:\n\np'² + m_μ² = (m_π - p')² = m_π² - 2 m_π p' + p'²\n\nSubtract p'² from both sides:\n\nm_μ² = m_π² - 2 m_π p'\n\nSolve for p':\n\n2 m_π p' = m_π² - m_μ²\n\np' = (m_π² - m_μ²)/(2 m_π)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nm_π = 139.57 MeV/c², m_μ = 105.66 MeV/c²\n\np' = (139.57² - 105.66²)/(2 * 139.57) MeV/c\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, compute numerator:\n\n139.57² = approx (140 - 0.43)^2 ≈ 140² - 2*140*0.43 + 0.43² ≈ 19600 - 120.4 + 0.1849 ≈ 19479.78\n\n105.66² ≈ (100 + 5.66)^2 = 10000 + 2*100*5.66 + 5.66² ≈ 10000 + 1132 + 32.0356 ≈ 11164.0356\n\nSo numerator: 19479.78 - 11164.0356 ≈ 8315.7444\n\nDivide by denominator 2*139.57 ≈ 279.14\n\nSo p' ≈ 8315.7444 / 279.14 ≈ let's compute that:\n\n279.14 * 30 = 8374.2, which is a bit more than 8315.74. So 30 - (8374.2 - 8315.74)/279.14 ≈ 30 - 58.46 / 279.14 ≈ 30 - 0.209 ≈ 29.791 MeV/c\n\nSo p' ≈ 29.79 MeV/c\n\nSo the muon's momentum in the pion rest frame is approximately 29.79 MeV/c in some direction. Let's say in the positive x-direction. Then the neutrino has momentum -29.79 MeV/c.\n\nBut in the pion rest frame, the muon can be emitted in any direction, right? Wait, no. Wait, in the rest frame, the decay is isotropic? Wait, no. Wait, the pion is a spin-0 particle, so the decay should be isotropic. But when considering momentum conservation, the muon and neutrino must be emitted in opposite directions. So in the rest frame, the muon and neutrino are emitted back-to-back. But their directions are random, so the muon can be emitted in any direction. However, when we boost to the lab frame, where the pion is moving, the direction of the muon in the lab frame depends on its emission angle in the rest frame.\n\nBut the problem states that some muons are going backward. So we need to find the pion's kinetic energy such that there exists an angle in the pion's rest frame where, after the Lorentz boost, the muon's velocity is opposite to the pion's direction in the lab.\n\nTo find the minimum kinetic energy T of the pion required for this to happen. Wait, but the question is asking for the range of T where this is possible. So maybe there's a minimum T and a maximum T? Wait, but since the pion is moving, and the muon is emitted backward in the lab frame, perhaps there's a minimum energy required for the muon to be able to go backward. If the pion is moving very fast, then even if the muon is emitted in the forward direction in the rest frame, after the boost, it might still be moving forward. But if the pion is moving at a certain speed, then when the muon is emitted opposite to the pion's motion in the rest frame, after the boost, it might end up moving backward.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find the condition where the muon's velocity in the lab frame is negative. So in the pion's rest frame, the muon is emitted in the opposite direction to the pion's motion in the lab. Then, when we boost to the lab frame, the muon's velocity could be negative.\n\nBut how do we calculate this?\n\nLet me consider the velocity of the pion in the lab frame. Let's denote the pion's speed as v (in natural units, c=1). The muon's velocity in the pion's rest frame is u'. Then, the muon's velocity in the lab frame is (u' + v)/(1 + u' v). We need this to be negative.\n\nSo, (u' + v)/(1 + u' v) < 0\n\nWhich implies that the numerator and denominator have opposite signs.\n\nCase 1: numerator positive, denominator negative.\n\nu' + v > 0 and 1 + u' v < 0\n\nBut since v is the speed of the pion, which is less than 1 (since nothing can go faster than light), and u' is the speed of the muon in the pion's rest frame. The muon's speed in the pion's rest frame can be calculated.\n\nWait, in the pion's rest frame, the muon has momentum p' and energy E'. The speed u' is p' c² / E'. Since in natural units, u' = p' / E'.\n\nWe already found p' ≈ 29.79 MeV/c. The energy of the muon in the rest frame is sqrt(p'^2 + m_μ^2) = sqrt(29.79^2 + 105.66^2) MeV.\n\nCompute that:\n\n29.79^2 ≈ 887.4\n\n105.66^2 ≈ 11164.0\n\nSum ≈ 887.4 + 11164.0 ≈ 12051.4\n\nsqrt(12051.4) ≈ 109.8 MeV\n\nSo E' ≈ 109.8 MeV\n\nTherefore, u' = p' / E' ≈ 29.79 / 109.8 ≈ 0.271 c\n\nSo the muon's speed in the pion's rest frame is about 0.271c.\n\nSo u' ≈ 0.271. Then, in the lab frame, the muon's speed is (u' + v)/(1 + u' v). We need this to be negative.\n\nSo (0.271 + v)/(1 + 0.271 v) < 0\n\nSo the numerator and denominator must have opposite signs.\n\nCase 1: 0.271 + v > 0 and 1 + 0.271 v < 0\n\nBut 1 + 0.271 v < 0 implies v < -1/0.271 ≈ -3.69, which is impossible since v is a speed and must be between 0 and 1.\n\nCase 2: 0.271 + v < 0 and 1 + 0.271 v > 0\n\nSo 0.271 + v < 0 ⇒ v < -0.271, which is impossible because v is positive (direction of pion's motion). So this case is also impossible.\n\nWait, that can't be. Then how can the muon ever go backward? There must be something wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. The velocity u' in the pion's rest frame can be in the opposite direction. So if the muon is emitted opposite to the pion's motion in the lab frame, then in the pion's rest frame, the muon is moving in the negative x-direction. So u' would be -0.271.\n\nAh, right! The muon can be emitted in the opposite direction in the pion's rest frame. So if the pion is moving in the +x direction in the lab frame, then in the pion's rest frame, the muon can be emitted in the -x direction (opposite to the pion's motion in the lab). Then, when we boost back to the lab frame, the muon's velocity could be negative.\n\nSo let's correct that. The muon's velocity in the pion's rest frame is u' = -0.271 (since it's emitted backward). Then, the velocity in the lab frame is:\n\nu = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v) = (-0.271 + v)/(1 - 0.271 v)\n\nWe need u < 0, so:\n\n(-0.271 + v)/(1 - 0.271 v) < 0\n\nAgain, numerator and denominator must have opposite signs.\n\nCase 1: (-0.271 + v) > 0 and (1 - 0.271 v) < 0\n\nFirst inequality: v > 0.271\n\nSecond inequality: 1 - 0.271 v < 0 ⇒ v > 1/0.271 ≈ 3.69, which is impossible since v < 1.\n\nCase 2: (-0.271 + v) < 0 and (1 - 0.271 v) > 0\n\nFirst inequality: v < 0.271\n\nSecond inequality: 1 - 0.271 v > 0 ⇒ v < 1/0.271 ≈ 3.69, which is always true since v < 1.\n\nSo the condition is v < 0.271. But wait, if the pion's speed is less than 0.271c, then the muon emitted backward in the pion's rest frame would have a negative velocity in the lab frame. But if the pion's speed is greater than 0.271c, then even the backward emission in the rest frame would result in a forward velocity in the lab.\n\nWait, that seems counterintuitive. Let me check with numbers. Suppose the pion is moving at v = 0.3c (greater than 0.271c). Then, plugging into the velocity transformation:\n\nu = (-0.271 + 0.3)/(1 - 0.271*0.3) = (0.029)/(1 - 0.0813) ≈ 0.029 / 0.9187 ≈ 0.0316, which is positive. So the muon would be moving forward in the lab frame even though it was emitted backward in the pion's rest frame. So to have the muon moving backward in the lab frame, the pion's speed must be less than 0.271c. But wait, if the pion is moving slower than 0.271c, then when the muon is emitted backward in the rest frame, it would have a negative velocity in the lab. But if the pion is moving faster than 0.271c, then even the backward emission in the rest frame results in forward motion in the lab.\n\nTherefore, the condition for the muon to be moving backward in the lab frame is that the pion's speed v < 0.271c. But wait, but the pion's kinetic energy is related to its speed. So we need to find the kinetic energy T such that the pion's speed is less than 0.271c. But wait, the kinetic energy of the pion is T = (γ - 1) m_π c². So if the pion's speed is less than 0.271c, then γ is small. Let's compute γ for v = 0.271c.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.271)^2) ≈ 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.0734) ≈ 1 / sqrt(0.9266) ≈ 1 / 0.962 ≈ 1.0395\n\nSo the kinetic energy T is (γ - 1) m_π c² ≈ (0.0395)(139.57 MeV) ≈ 5.51 MeV.\n\nSo if the pion's kinetic energy is less than approximately 5.51 MeV, then its speed is less than 0.271c, and a muon emitted backward in the rest frame would move backward in the lab frame. But wait, the problem states that the muons are going backward. So the range of T where this is possible is T < 5.51 MeV? But wait, the question says \"for what range of T is this possible?\" So if T is less than 5.51 MeV, then it's possible. But if T is greater than that, even the backward-emitted muons in the rest frame are moving forward in the lab frame. Therefore, the maximum T for which backward muons are possible is 5.51 MeV. But the problem says \"range of T\", so maybe T has to be less than that. But wait, the problem says \"some μ⁺ going backward\". So even if the pion is at rest (T=0), the muon can be emitted in any direction, but in the lab frame (which is the same as the pion rest frame when T=0), the muon would be moving in some direction. Wait, but if the pion is at rest, then in the lab frame, the muon can be emitted in any direction, including backward. Wait, but in the pion rest frame, the muon is emitted isotropically. But when the pion is moving, the lab frame is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine the problem. The pion is moving with kinetic energy T, and in the lab frame, some muons are observed to go backward. The question is for what range of T is this possible.\n\nSo the key is that in the lab frame, there exists some decay angle where the muon is moving backward. The necessary condition is that the velocity of the pion is such that even the most forward-moving muon in the rest frame (from the pion's perspective) could be transformed to the lab frame as backward-moving.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the maximum possible velocity of the muon in the lab frame. Wait, no. To have a muon moving backward, the muon's velocity in the lab frame must be negative. The condition for this is that in the pion's rest frame, the muon is emitted in the opposite direction to the pion's motion in the lab, and the pion's speed is low enough that the boost doesn't make the muon's velocity positive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the concept of the \"threshold\" for backward emission. Let me think in terms of reference frames.\n\nIn the pion's rest frame, the muon is emitted with speed u' = 0.271c (as calculated earlier). The maximum possible speed at which the pion can move such that a muon emitted opposite to the pion's motion in the lab frame ends up with negative lab velocity.\n\nWait, perhaps using the velocity addition formula. Let me denote the pion's velocity in the lab frame as v (along the x-axis). The muon is emitted in the opposite direction in the pion's rest frame, so its velocity in the pion's frame is u' = -u'_0, where u'_0 ≈ 0.271c.\n\nThen, the muon's velocity in the lab frame is:\n\nu = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v/c²)\n\nPlugging u' = -u'_0:\n\nu = (-u'_0 + v)/(1 - u'_0 v/c²)\n\nWe need u < 0 for the muon to be moving backward. So:\n\n(-u'_0 + v) / (1 - u'_0 v/c²) < 0\n\nMultiply both sides by the denominator squared (which is positive), so inequality remains:\n\n(-u'_0 + v)(1 - u'_0 v/c²) < 0\n\nLet me compute this expression.\n\nFirst, note that u'_0 ≈ 0.271c. Let's express everything in terms of β = v/c, and β'_0 = u'_0/c ≈ 0.271.\n\nThen, the inequality becomes:\n\n(-β'_0 + β)(1 - β'_0 β) < 0\n\nSo:\n\n(β - β'_0)(1 - β'_0 β) < 0\n\nLet me analyze this inequality.\n\nThe product of two terms is negative when one is positive and the other is negative.\n\nCase 1: (β - β'_0) > 0 and (1 - β'_0 β) < 0\n\nFirst condition: β > β'_0 ≈ 0.271\n\nSecond condition: 1 - β'_0 β < 0 ⇒ β > 1/β'_0 ≈ 3.69, which is impossible since β ≤ 1.\n\nCase 2: (β - β'_0) < 0 and (1 - β'_0 β) > 0\n\nFirst condition: β < β'_0 ≈ 0.271\n\nSecond condition: 1 - β'_0 β > 0 ⇒ β < 1/β'_0 ≈ 3.69, which is always true since β ≤ 1.\n\nTherefore, the inequality holds when β < β'_0 ≈ 0.271.\n\nThus, the pion's speed must be less than β'_0 c ≈ 0.271c for there to exist muons moving backward in the lab frame.\n\nTherefore, the corresponding kinetic energy T is when the pion's speed is less than 0.271c. To find T, we need to compute the kinetic energy of the pion when its speed is 0.271c.\n\nThe total energy of the pion is γ m_π c², where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). The kinetic energy T is (γ - 1) m_π c².\n\nCompute γ for β = 0.271:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.271)^2) ≈ 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.0734) ≈ 1 / sqrt(0.9266) ≈ 1 / 0.962 ≈ 1.0395\n\nSo T = (1.0395 - 1) * 139.57 MeV ≈ 0.0395 * 139.57 ≈ 5.51 MeV\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energy T must be less than approximately 5.51 MeV for the pion to have a speed less than 0.271c, allowing some muons to be emitted backward in the lab frame.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the range of T where this is possible. So the range is from T = 0 up to T ≈ 5.51 MeV. However, when T = 0, the pion is at rest, and the muon is emitted isotropically. In that case, half of the muons would be emitted backward in the lab frame (which is the same as the pion's rest frame). So for T = 0, it's possible. As T increases, the maximum T where backward muons are possible is when the pion's speed reaches 0.271c, which corresponds to T ≈ 5.51 MeV. Beyond that, even the muons emitted backward in the pion's rest frame are moving forward in the lab frame.\n\nTherefore, the range of T is 0 ≤ T < 5.51 MeV. But wait, the problem states \"a beam of π⁺ mesons of kinetic energy T yields some μ⁺ going backward\". So the answer is that T must be less than approximately 5.51 MeV. But let me check the exact value.\n\nWait, let's compute the exact value of p' and β'_0.\n\nEarlier, we approximated p' as 29.79 MeV/c. Let's compute it more accurately.\n\nGiven m_π c² = 139.57 MeV, m_μ c² = 105.66 MeV.\n\nFrom the conservation of energy in the pion rest frame:\n\nE_μ + E_ν = m_π c²\n\nBut E_ν = p_ν c = p_μ c (since momentum is conserved, p_μ = p_ν in magnitude but opposite in direction).\n\nSo E_μ = sqrt( (p_μ c)^2 + (m_μ c²)^2 ) = sqrt( p_μ² c² + m_μ² c^4 ) / c² ?\n\nWait, no. Let's be precise with units. Let's use natural units where c=1 for simplicity.\n\nIn natural units, m_π = 139.57 MeV, m_μ = 105.66 MeV, m_ν = 0.\n\nIn the pion rest frame, the total energy is m_π. The muon and neutrino are emitted with momenta p and -p respectively.\n\nSo:\n\nE_μ = sqrt(p² + m_μ²)\n\nE_ν = p\n\nSo:\n\nsqrt(p² + m_μ²) + p = m_π\n\nSolve for p:\n\nsqrt(p² + m_μ²) = m_π - p\n\nSquare both sides:\n\np² + m_μ² = m_π² - 2 m_π p + p²\n\nCancel p²:\n\nm_μ² = m_π² - 2 m_π p\n\nThen:\n\n2 m_π p = m_π² - m_μ²\n\np = (m_π² - m_μ²)/(2 m_π)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nm_π² = (139.57)^2 = let's compute this exactly:\n\n139.57 * 139.57:\n\nFirst compute 140 * 140 = 19600\n\nSubtract 0.43 * 140 + 0.43 * 140 - 0.43^2\n\nWait, (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². So 139.57 = 140 - 0.43\n\nSo (140 - 0.43)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.43 + 0.43² = 19600 - 120.4 + 0.1849 = 19600 - 120.4 = 19479.6; 19479.6 + 0.1849 ≈ 19479.7849 MeV²\n\nSimilarly, m_μ² = (105.66)^2 = let's compute:\n\n105^2 = 11025\n\n0.66^2 = 0.4356\n\nCross term: 2*105*0.66 = 138.6\n\nSo (105 + 0.66)^2 = 11025 + 138.6 + 0.4356 = 11164.0356 MeV²\n\nThus, m_π² - m_μ² = 19479.7849 - 11164.0356 = 8315.7493 MeV²\n\nThen p = 8315.7493 / (2 * 139.57) ≈ 8315.7493 / 279.14 ≈\n\nLet's compute 279.14 * 29 = 8095.06\n\n279.14 * 29.7 = 8095.06 + 279.14*0.7 = 8095.06 + 195.398 = 8290.458\n\n279.14 * 29.8 = 8290.458 + 279.14*0.1 = 8290.458 + 27.914 ≈ 8318.372\n\nBut we have 8315.7493, which is 8318.372 - 2.6227 ≈ 29.8 - (2.6227 / 279.14) ≈ 29.8 - 0.0094 ≈ 29.7906\n\nSo p ≈ 29.7906 MeV/c\n\nThen, the muon's energy in the pion rest frame is sqrt(p² + m_μ²) = sqrt(29.7906² + 105.66²) ≈ sqrt(887.47 + 11164.0) ≈ sqrt(12051.47) ≈ 109.8 MeV\n\nTherefore, the speed of the muon in the pion rest frame is u' = p / E_μ = 29.7906 / 109.8 ≈ 0.2713 c\n\nSo β'_0 = u' / c = 0.2713\n\nTherefore, the critical pion speed is β = β'_0 = 0.2713\n\nThen, the corresponding γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2713²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.0736) = 1 / sqrt(0.9264) ≈ 1 / 0.962 ≈ 1.0395\n\nThus, the kinetic energy T is (γ - 1) m_π c² ≈ (0.0395)(139.57 MeV) ≈ 5.51 MeV\n\nTherefore, the maximum kinetic energy T for which backward-moving muons are possible is approximately 5.51 MeV. Hence, the range of T is from 0 up to this value.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"range of T\", so we need to express this as 0 ≤ T < T_max, where T_max is 5.51 MeV. However, let's compute T_max more accurately.\n\nCompute γ more precisely:\n\nβ = 0.2713\n\nβ² = (0.2713)^2 = 0.0736\n\n1 - β² = 0.9264\n\nsqrt(0.9264) = 0.962\n\nγ = 1 / 0.962 ≈ 1.0395\n\nThen, T = (γ - 1) m_π c² = (0.0395)(139.57) ≈ 5.51 MeV\n\nBut let's compute it exactly:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - ( (m_π² - m_μ²)/(2 m_π^2) ) )\n\nWait, perhaps there's a more precise way to express T_max.\n\nAlternatively, since we have β = u'_0 = p / E_μ = (m_π² - m_μ²)/(2 m_π) / ( (m_π² + m_μ²)/(2 m_π) ) )\n\nWait, E_μ = sqrt(p² + m_μ²) = sqrt( (m_π² - m_μ²)^2/(4 m_π²) + m_μ² )\n\n= sqrt( (m_π^4 - 2 m_π² m_μ² + m_μ^4 + 4 m_π² m_μ² ) / (4 m_π²) )\n\n= sqrt( (m_π^4 + 2 m_π² m_μ² + m_μ^4 ) / (4 m_π²) )\n\n= sqrt( (m_π² + m_μ²)^2 / (4 m_π²) )\n\n= (m_π² + m_μ²)/(2 m_π)\n\nTherefore, E_μ = (m_π² + m_μ²)/(2 m_π)\n\nThen, β'_0 = p / E_μ = [ (m_π² - m_μ²)/(2 m_π) ] / [ (m_π² + m_μ²)/(2 m_π) ] = (m_π² - m_μ²)/(m_π² + m_μ²)\n\nSo β'_0 = (m_π² - m_μ²)/(m_π² + m_μ²)\n\nTherefore, the critical β is β = β'_0 = (m_π² - m_μ²)/(m_π² + m_μ²)\n\nThen, the corresponding γ is:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²)\n\nCompute β²:\n\nβ² = [ (m_π² - m_μ²)/(m_π² + m_μ²) ]²\n\nSo 1 - β² = 1 - [ (m_π² - m_μ²)^2 ] / (m_π² + m_μ²)^2\n\n= [ (m_π² + m_μ²)^2 - (m_π² - m_μ²)^2 ] / (m_π² + m_μ²)^2\n\nExpand numerator:\n\n= [ (m_π^4 + 2 m_π² m_μ² + m_μ^4) - (m_π^4 - 2 m_π² m_μ² + m_μ^4) ] / denominator\n\n= [4 m_π² m_μ²] / (m_π² + m_μ²)^2\n\nThus,\n\n1 - β² = 4 m_π² m_μ² / (m_π² + m_μ²)^2\n\nTherefore,\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(4 m_π² m_μ² / (m_π² + m_μ²)^2 ) = (m_π² + m_μ²)/(2 m_π m_μ)\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energy T is:\n\nT = (γ - 1) m_π c² = [ (m_π² + m_μ²)/(2 m_π m_μ) - 1 ] m_π c²\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [ (m_π² + m_μ² - 2 m_π m_μ) / (2 m_π m_μ) ] m_π c²\n\n= [ (m_π - m_μ)^2 / (2 m_π m_μ) ] m_π c²\n\n= (m_π - m_μ)^2 / (2 m_μ) * c²\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nm_π c² = 139.57 MeV\n\nm_μ c² = 105.66 MeV\n\nSo,\n\nT = (139.57 - 105.66)^2 / (2 * 105.66) MeV\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n139.57 - 105.66 = 33.91 MeV\n\n(33.91)^2 = 33.91 * 33.91\n\nCompute 30*30 = 900, 30*3.91=117.3, 3.91*30=117.3, 3.91*3.91≈15.2881\n\nSo total: 900 + 117.3 + 117.3 + 15.2881 ≈ 900 + 234.6 + 15.2881 ≈ 1149.8881 MeV²\n\nThen divide by (2 * 105.66) = 211.32\n\nSo T ≈ 1149.8881 / 211.32 ≈ 5.44 MeV\n\nAh, so the exact value is approximately 5.44 MeV, which is slightly less than the earlier approximation of 5.51 MeV. This is due to more precise calculation.\n\nTherefore, the maximum kinetic energy T is (m_π - m_μ)^2 / (2 m_μ) ≈ 5.44 MeV.\n\nThus, the range of T is from 0 up to this value. Therefore, the possible range of T is 0 ≤ T ≤ (m_π - m_μ)^2 / (2 m_μ)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n(m_π - m_μ) = 139.57 - 105.66 = 33.91 MeV\n\n(m_π - m_μ)^2 = 33.91² = 1149.8881 MeV²\n\nDivide by (2 m_μ) = 2 * 105.66 = 211.32 MeV\n\nT_max = 1149.8881 / 211.32 ≈ 5.44 MeV\n\nSo the range is T must be less than or equal to approximately 5.44 MeV. Therefore, the answer is that the kinetic energy T must be in the range 0 ≤ T ≤ (m_π - m_μ)^2/(2 m_μ), which evaluates to approximately 5.44 MeV.\n\nExpressed in terms of the given masses, the exact expression is:\n\nT_max = \\frac{(m_{\\pi} - m_{\\mu})^2}{2 m_{\\mu}} c^2\n\nBut since the units are given in MeV, and c² is already accounted for in the masses, we can write:\n\nT_max = \\frac{(m_{\\pi} c^2 - m_{\\mu} c^2)^2}{2 m_{\\mu} c^2}\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nT_max = \\frac{(139.57 - 105.66)^2}{2 \\times 105.66} \\text{ MeV} = \\frac{(33.91)^2}{211.32} \\text{ MeV} ≈ 5.44 \\text{ MeV}\n\nTherefore, the range of T is from 0 up to approximately 5.44 MeV. Hence, the possible range is 0 ≤ T ≤ 5.44 MeV.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe range of kinetic energy \\( T \\) is from 0 up to \\( \\boxed{5.44 \\text{ MeV}} \\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the range of kinetic energy \\( T \\) for which a beam of \\( \\pi^+ \\) mesons can produce \\( \\mu^+ \\) particles moving backward, we analyze the decay process \\( \\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu \\) in the lab frame where the pion is moving.

{"id": "atomic/4-47", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. So, the problem is about a D⁰ charmed particle that decays after traveling 3 mm in the bubble chamber. We need to find the time it lived in its own rest frame. Hmm, right. This sounds like a relativity problem involving time dilation. \n\nFirst, I remember that in particle physics, the lifetime measured in the lab frame (where the particle is moving) is different from the proper time in the particle's rest frame. The proper time is shorter due to time dilation. The formula connecting them is the proper time τ equals the lab frame time t divided by the Lorentz factor gamma (τ = t / γ). But wait, actually, the lab frame time is gamma multiplied by the proper time. So τ = t / gamma. Yeah, that's right. Because from the lab frame, the particle's clock runs slower, so the proper time is shorter.\n\nBut to find τ, we need to find t first, the time in the lab frame, and then divide by gamma. But how do we get t? The particle travels 3 mm in the lab frame. So the lab frame time t is the distance divided by the speed of the particle. But we don't have the speed directly. However, we have the total energy of the decay products, which is 20 GeV. Wait, but the total energy of the decay products should be equal to the energy of the D⁰ particle in the lab frame, right? Because energy is conserved. So the total energy E of the D⁰ is 20 GeV. And we know its rest mass m is 1.86 GeV. So we can compute gamma from E = gamma * m c². But since we're working in natural units where c=1, E = gamma * m. So gamma = E / m = 20 GeV / 1.86 GeV ≈ 10.7527.\n\nThen, gamma is approximately 10.75. Now, the speed can be found from gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²), so solving for v: v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Let me compute that. 1/gamma² is 1/(10.75)^2 ≈ 1/115.56 ≈ 0.00865. So 1 - 0.00865 ≈ 0.99135. Then sqrt(0.99135) ≈ 0.9957. So v ≈ 0.9957c. But since we need the velocity to compute the lab time t, which is distance divided by velocity. The distance is 3 mm, which is 3e-3 meters. But maybe we can use natural units where c=3e8 m/s. Let's see.\n\nWait, but in particle physics, when dealing with lifetimes, the proper time τ is related to the lab frame distance via the formula: distance = v * gamma * tau. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is t = gamma * tau, and the distance is v * t = v * gamma * tau. So rearranged, tau = distance / (v * gamma). Alternatively, since gamma = E/m, and E is given, maybe we can use that.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the lab frame time t first. The particle travels 3 mm at speed v. So t = distance / v. Then, the proper time tau is t / gamma. So tau = (distance / v) / gamma. But since gamma = E/m, and v can be expressed in terms of gamma. Let's see. From gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²), so v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Let's compute v in terms of gamma. So substituting that into tau:\n\ntau = (distance / (sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) * c)) / gamma\n\nBut since in natural units, c=1, but here we need to keep track of units. Wait, the distance is given in mm, so we need to convert units properly. Let's recall that in particle physics, we often use c=3e8 m/s, and distances in meters, time in seconds. But maybe there's a more convenient way using the relation between lifetime, speed, and distance.\n\nAlternatively, using natural units where c=1, but then we need to convert the distance into units compatible with time. Since 1 mm is 1e-3 meters, and c is approximately 3e8 m/s, so 1 mm / c is (1e-3 m) / (3e8 m/s) = 1/(3e11) seconds ≈ 3.333e-12 seconds. But maybe we can use the fact that in natural units (GeV and seconds), 1 GeV^-1 ≈ 6.582e-25 seconds. But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the velocity v. From gamma = 10.75, so v = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/115.56) ≈ sqrt(0.99135) ≈ 0.9957c. So v ≈ 0.9957 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.987e8 m/s. Then, the lab frame time t is distance / velocity. The distance is 3 mm = 3e-3 m. So t = 3e-3 m / 2.987e8 m/s ≈ 1.005e-11 seconds. Then, the proper time tau is t / gamma ≈ 1.005e-11 s / 10.75 ≈ 9.35e-13 seconds. But the problem asks for the time in the rest frame, which is tau. But maybe we need to express it in terms of seconds or using some other unit? The answer is likely expected in seconds, but perhaps in terms of the particle physics unit like picoseconds (1e-12 seconds). 9.35e-13 seconds is 0.935 picoseconds, which is reasonable for a particle lifetime.\n\nBut let me check the calculation again. Let's compute gamma again: E = 20 GeV, m = 1.86 GeV. So gamma = 20 / 1.86 ≈ 10.7527. Correct. Then, v = sqrt(1 - (1.86/20)^2) ? Wait, no. Wait, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So solving for v: v = c * sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 c^4)) ) = c * sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)) ). Since in natural units where c=1, v = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2). So m/E is 1.86/20 ≈ 0.093. So (m/E)^2 ≈ 0.00865. Then sqrt(1 - 0.00865) ≈ sqrt(0.99135) ≈ 0.9957. So v ≈ 0.9957c. Correct.\n\nThen, t = distance / v. Distance is 3 mm = 3e-3 m. v ≈ 0.9957 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.987e8 m/s. So t ≈ 3e-3 / 2.987e8 ≈ 1.005e-11 seconds. Then tau = t / gamma ≈ 1.005e-11 / 10.75 ≈ 9.35e-13 seconds. So approximately 0.935 picoseconds. But let me check if there's a formula that can directly relate the proper time to the lab measurements without going through velocity.\n\nAlternatively, the proper time tau can be calculated using the invariant quantity: the spacetime interval. In the lab frame, the particle moves a distance L, so the spacetime interval squared is (c t)^2 - L^2 = (c tau)^2. So (c tau)^2 = (c t)^2 - L^2. Therefore, tau = sqrt( t^2 - (L/c)^2 ). But here, t is the lab frame time, which is L/(v). So substituting t = L/(v), we get tau = sqrt( (L/(v))^2 - (L/c)^2 ) = L/(v) * sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) ). But since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/gamma. Therefore, tau = L/(v) * (1/gamma) = L/(v gamma). But from gamma = E/(m c²), and v = c * sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 c^4)) ) = c * sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ). So substituting v gamma: v gamma = c * sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) * (E/(m c²)) ) = (E/(m c)) * sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ). Wait, this seems complicated. Let me see if there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, using the relation between gamma, energy, and mass. Since gamma = E/m, and beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ). Then, the proper time tau is t / gamma. But t = L/(v) = L/(beta c). So tau = (L/(beta c)) / gamma = L/(beta c gamma). But beta gamma = (v/c) * gamma. From beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ), and gamma = E/m. So beta gamma = (E/m) * sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) = sqrt( (E/m)^2 (1 - (m/E)^2 )) = sqrt( (E^2/m^2) - 1 ). Therefore, beta gamma = sqrt( (E/m)^2 - 1 ). So tau = L/(c sqrt( (E/m)^2 - 1 )).\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. E = 20 GeV, m = 1.86 GeV. So (E/m)^2 - 1 = (20/1.86)^2 - 1 ≈ (10.7527)^2 - 1 ≈ 115.56 - 1 = 114.56. So sqrt(114.56) ≈ 10.7. Then tau = L/(c * 10.7). L is 3 mm = 3e-3 m. c is 3e8 m/s. So tau ≈ 3e-3 / (3e8 * 10.7) ≈ 3e-3 / 3.21e9 ≈ 9.345e-13 seconds. Which matches the previous result. So that's reassuring. So the proper time is approximately 9.35e-13 seconds. \n\nBut maybe we can express this in terms of the particle's lifetime. However, the problem doesn't give the mean lifetime; it just asks for the time lived in its rest frame, which is tau. So the answer is approximately 9.35e-13 seconds. But let's check the calculation once more.\n\nAlternatively, using natural units where c=1, and converting distance to time via c. So 3 mm is 3e-3 meters. Since c ≈ 3e8 m/s, the time taken for light to travel 3 mm is 3e-3 / 3e8 = 1e-11 seconds. But the particle is moving at v ≈ 0.9957c, so the time in lab frame is (3e-3 m) / (0.9957 * 3e8 m/s) ≈ 3e-3 / (2.987e8) ≈ 1.005e-11 seconds. Then divide by gamma ≈ 10.75 to get tau ≈ 9.35e-13 seconds. So yes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer to part (a) is approximately 9.35e-13 seconds. But let's compute it more precisely. Let's do the exact calculation step by step.\n\nFirst, gamma = 20 / 1.86 ≈ 10.75268817. Then, beta = sqrt(1 - (1.86/20)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.093)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.008649) = sqrt(0.991351) ≈ 0.995666. Then, t = L / (beta c) = 3e-3 m / (0.995666 * 3e8 m/s) = 3e-3 / (2.986998e8) ≈ 1.0048e-11 seconds. Then tau = t / gamma ≈ 1.0048e-11 / 10.75268817 ≈ 9.34e-13 seconds. So approximately 9.34e-13 s. \n\nBut maybe we can write it in terms of the formula. Since tau = (L * m) / (E * sqrt(E² - m²)) ) * (1/c). Wait, let's see. From the invariant interval:\n\ntau = sqrt( (t)^2 - (L/c)^2 ) = t * sqrt(1 - (L/(c t))^2 ). But since t = L/(v), then L/(c t) = v/c. So tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t / gamma. Which is the same as before. So another way to write tau is (L / v) / gamma. But since v = beta c, and gamma = E/m, then tau = L / (beta c gamma) = L * m / (beta c gamma m) ? Wait, maybe not. Let's see:\n\nAlternatively, using the formula tau = (L * m) / (p c), where p is the momentum. Because in natural units, p = gamma m v, but maybe not. Wait, p = gamma m v. So p = gamma m beta c. So tau = L * m / (p c) = L * m / (gamma m beta c^2) ) = L / (gamma beta c^2) * m / m. Wait, this seems messy. Maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the relation between lifetime and path length. The proper lifetime tau is related to the lab frame path length L by L = gamma beta c tau. So solving for tau: tau = L / (gamma beta c). Let's compute that. L is 3e-3 m. gamma is 10.7527, beta is 0.995666, c is 3e8 m/s. So tau = 3e-3 / (10.7527 * 0.995666 * 3e8) ≈ 3e-3 / (10.7527 * 0.995666 * 3e8). Let's compute denominator: 10.7527 * 0.995666 ≈ 10.7527 * 0.995666 ≈ 10.7. Then 10.7 * 3e8 ≈ 3.21e9. So 3e-3 / 3.21e9 ≈ 9.345e-13 seconds. Same result. So this confirms the answer.\n\nTherefore, the proper lifetime tau is approximately 9.34e-13 seconds. To express this in a box, we can write it as \\boxed{9.3 \\times 10^{-13} \\text{ s}} or maybe with more precise decimals if needed, but the exact value would depend on precise calculation. Let me check the exact calculation:\n\ngamma = 20 / 1.86 ≈ 10.75268817204301\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - (1.86/20)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.093)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.008649) = sqrt(0.991351) ≈ 0.995666205\n\nThen, tau = L / (gamma beta c) = 3e-3 m / (10.75268817204301 * 0.995666205 * 3e8 m/s)\n\nCompute denominator: 10.75268817204301 * 0.995666205 ≈ 10.752688 * 0.995666 ≈ Let's compute 10 * 0.995666 = 9.95666, 0.752688 * 0.995666 ≈ 0.752688*0.995666 ≈ 0.752688*(1 - 0.004334) ≈ 0.752688 - 0.752688*0.004334 ≈ 0.752688 - 0.00326 ≈ 0.749428. So total denominator ≈ 9.95666 + 0.749428 ≈ 10.706088. Then multiply by 3e8: 10.706088 * 3e8 ≈ 3.2118e9. Then tau = 3e-3 / 3.2118e9 ≈ 9.34e-13 seconds. So approximately 9.34e-13 s. So boxed as \\boxed{9.3 \\times 10^{-13} \\text{ s}}.\n\nNow, part (b): comparing the expected time distributions in the D⁰ rest frame for decay modes with branching ratios 1% and 40%. \n\nBranching ratio is the fraction of decays that proceed via a particular mode. The time distribution in the rest frame should follow an exponential decay law, since particle decay is a Poisson process. The probability density function for decay time tau is (1/Γ) e^{-Γ tau}, where Γ is the total decay width. However, the branching ratio (BR) for a particular decay mode is the ratio of the partial width Γ_i to the total width Γ: BR_i = Γ_i / Γ. \n\nBut the key point is that the lifetime distribution (i.e., the proper time distribution) depends only on the total width Γ, not on the branching ratio. Because regardless of which decay mode is observed, the particle's lifetime is determined by the total decay rate. So even if one decay mode has a higher branching ratio, the time distribution in the rest frame should be the same for all decay modes. \n\nWait, but wait. The total decay width Γ is the sum of all partial widths. So Γ = Γ1 + Γ2 + ... If a decay mode has a higher branching ratio, that means its partial width Γ_i is larger. But the lifetime of the particle is τ = 1/Γ. So if a particle has multiple decay channels, the total Γ is the sum, and the lifetime is the same regardless of which decay channel is observed. Therefore, the time distribution for any decay mode should be the same exponential distribution, with the same mean lifetime. \n\nTherefore, the expected time distributions for both decay modes (1% and 40% branching ratios) should be identical, both following the exponential distribution e^{-Γ tau} with Γ = total decay width. The branching ratio affects how often a particular decay occurs, but not the time distribution of when it occurs. \n\nSo the answer is that both time distributions are identical, exponential with the same mean lifetime. \n\nBut let me think again. Suppose the particle can decay via two channels: channel A with Γ_A and channel B with Γ_B. The total Γ = Γ_A + Γ_B. The probability density function for decaying at time tau is (Γ_A + Γ_B) e^{-(Γ_A + Γ_B) tau}. The probability that it decays via channel A is Γ_A / (Γ_A + Γ_B), and similarly for B. But the time distribution for decays via channel A is [Γ_A e^{-(Γ_A + Γ_B) tau}] / (Γ_A / (Γ_A + Γ_B)) )? Wait, no. The joint probability that it decays at time tau AND via channel A is Γ_A e^{-Γ_total tau}. The marginal distribution for the time of decay via channel A is obtained by integrating over all possible times, but the shape is still Γ_total e^{-Γ_total tau}, multiplied by the branching ratio. But when you condition on the decay mode, the distribution remains the same. Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nThe probability that the particle decays in the time interval [tau, tau + dtau) via channel A is Γ_A e^{-Γ_total tau} dtau. Similarly for channel B. The total probability that it decays via A is integral_0^infty Γ_A e^{-Γ_total tau} dtau = Γ_A / Γ_total = BR_A. But the distribution of decay times for channel A, given that it decayed via A, is (Γ_A e^{-Γ_total tau}) / BR_A = (Γ_A e^{-Γ_total tau}) / (Γ_A / Γ_total) ) = Γ_total e^{-Γ_total tau}. Similarly for channel B. Therefore, the time distribution for any specific decay channel is still exponential with the same decay constant Γ_total. Therefore, regardless of the branching ratio, the time distribution in the rest frame is the same. \n\nTherefore, even though one decay mode occurs more frequently (40% vs 1%), the distribution of decay times (in the rest frame) should be identical for both modes. They both follow the same exponential decay law with the same mean lifetime. The branching ratio only affects the fraction of decays that proceed via each channel, not the time at which they occur. \n\nSo the answer to part (b) is that the time distributions are the same for both decay modes.\n</think>\n\n(a) To determine the proper lifetime \\( \\tau \\) of the \\( D^0 \\) particle in its rest frame, we use relativistic time dilation.

{"id": "atomic/3-50", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these physics problems one by one. Starting with part (a). The question is about finding the minimum and maximum momentum of the muon in the decay of a pion that has momentum p. The masses of the neutrinos are zero, and we're told to assume p is much larger than the muon and pion masses. Hmm, right. So, pion decays into a muon and a neutrino. Since the pion is moving with some momentum p, we need to consider the decay in the pion's rest frame and then boost back to the lab frame? Wait, but the pion's momentum is given as p in the lab frame, right? Or is the pion at rest? Wait, the problem states that the pion has momentum p. So the decay is happening while the pion is moving with momentum p. So we need to analyze this in the lab frame where the pion is moving. But maybe it's easier to first consider the rest frame of the pion and then transform to the lab frame. Because in the rest frame, the muon and neutrino are emitted with certain momenta, and then when we boost to the lab frame where the pion is moving, we can find the maximum and minimum momentum of the muon. \n\nWait, but when dealing with relativistic decays, the maximum and minimum momenta usually come from considering the decay in the rest frame and then boosting. Alternatively, maybe using conservation of energy and momentum in the lab frame. But since the pion is moving with momentum p, which is much larger than its mass (since p >> m_pi), perhaps we can use some approximations here. Let me think. \n\nIn the rest frame of the pion, the muon and neutrino are emitted in opposite directions. The muon's momentum in the rest frame can be calculated using energy and momentum conservation. The energy of the pion is its rest mass, m_pi c². Then, the muon and neutrino share the energy. Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum. Let me denote variables in the rest frame with primes. So, in the rest frame:\n\nEnergy conservation: m_pi c² = E_mu' + E_nu'\n\nMomentum conservation: 0 = p_mu' + p_nu'\n\nSince the neutrino is massless, E_nu' = |p_nu'| c. And the muon's energy is sqrt( (p_mu' c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). From momentum conservation, p_nu' = -p_mu', so their magnitudes are equal. Let's denote |p_mu'| = |p_nu'| = p'. Then:\n\nEnergy conservation becomes:\n\nm_pi c² = sqrt( (p' c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p' c\n\nLet me divide both sides by c² to make it simpler:\n\nm_pi = sqrt( (p')² + m_mu² c² ) / c + p' / c\n\nWait, maybe better to write in terms of units where c=1. Let's set c=1 for simplicity. Then:\n\nm_pi = sqrt( p'^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p'\n\nSo, solving for p':\n\nsqrt(p'^2 + m_mu^2) = m_pi - p'\n\nSquare both sides:\n\np'^2 + m_mu^2 = m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p' + p'^2\n\nCancel p'^2 terms:\n\nm_mu^2 = m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p'\n\nThen:\n\n2 m_pi p' = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2\n\nSo:\n\np' = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi)\n\nThat's the magnitude of the muon's momentum in the pion rest frame. So in the rest frame, the muon has momentum p' = (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi). But since the pion is moving in the lab frame, we need to boost this momentum to the lab frame. The problem states that the pion has momentum p in the lab frame, and p >> m_pi, m_mu. So we can approximate the pion's energy as E_pi ≈ p c (since for high momentum, energy is approximately pc). But maybe we need to use Lorentz transformations here. \n\nThe Lorentz boost from the pion rest frame to the lab frame. Wait, but the pion is moving in the lab frame. So the lab frame is moving with some velocity relative to the pion rest frame. Let me recall that when you have a particle moving with momentum p, its rest frame is moving with velocity v relative to the lab. The Lorentz factor gamma is E_pi / m_pi c². Since in the lab frame, the pion's energy is E_pi = sqrt( p² c² + m_pi² c^4 ) ≈ p c (since p >> m_pi). So gamma ≈ p c / (m_pi c²) ) = p / (m_pi c). So gamma is approximately p/(m_pi c). The velocity beta is v/c = p c / E_pi ≈ (p c)/(p c) ) = 1. So beta ≈ 1. So the boost is ultrarelativistic. \n\nBut to find the muon's momentum in the lab frame, we need to apply the Lorentz transformation to the muon's momentum from the rest frame to the lab frame. The direction of the boost is along the direction of the pion's motion. Let's assume that in the pion rest frame, the muon is emitted at some angle theta' with respect to the boost direction (which is the direction of the pion's motion in the lab frame). The maximum and minimum momentum in the lab frame will occur when the muon is emitted in the same direction as the boost (theta' = 0) or opposite (theta' = pi). \n\nThe Lorentz transformation for momentum in the direction of the boost (let's take the x-direction) is:\n\np_x = gamma (p_x' + beta E')\n\np_y = p_y' / gamma\n\np_z = p_z' / gamma\n\nBut since in the rest frame, the muon's momentum can be in any direction. To find the maximum and minimum p_mu in the lab frame, we need to consider when the muon is moving in the same direction as the boost (theta' = 0) or opposite (theta' = pi). \n\nIn the rest frame, the muon's momentum is p' in some direction. Let's align the boost along the x-axis. Then, if the muon is emitted along the +x' direction (same as the boost), then its momentum in the lab frame will be boosted to higher momentum. If it's emitted opposite, then it might be lower. \n\nSo, the maximum momentum in the lab frame occurs when the muon is emitted in the same direction as the pion's motion (theta' = 0), and the minimum when it's emitted opposite (theta' = pi). \n\nSo, let's compute p_mu_max and p_mu_min. \n\nFirst, in the rest frame, the muon's momentum is p' = (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi). Let's compute the components. If emitted along +x', then p_x' = p', p_y' = 0, p_z' = 0. Then, in the lab frame:\n\np_x = gamma (p' + beta E_mu')\n\nE_mu' = sqrt( p'^2 + m_mu^2 )\n\nBut beta ≈ 1, gamma ≈ p/(m_pi c). Wait, but let's be precise. Let's use the exact expressions. The pion's energy in the lab frame is E_pi = sqrt( p² c² + m_pi² c^4 ). Then, the velocity beta is (p c)/E_pi, and gamma is E_pi/(m_pi c²). \n\nBut given that p >> m_pi, m_mu, we can approximate E_pi ≈ p c. Then beta ≈ 1, gamma ≈ p/(m_pi c). \n\nSo, for the muon emitted along the boost direction (theta' = 0):\n\np_mu_lab_x = gamma (p' + beta E_mu')\n\nE_mu' = sqrt( p'^2 + m_mu^2 )\n\nBut p' = (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi). Let's compute E_mu':\n\nE_mu' = sqrt( [ (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi) ]^2 + m_mu^2 )\n\n= sqrt( (m_pi^4 - 2 m_pi² m_mu² + m_mu^4 + 4 m_pi² m_mu^2 ) / (4 m_pi²) )\n\n= sqrt( (m_pi^4 + 2 m_pi² m_mu² + m_mu^4 ) / (4 m_pi²) )\n\n= sqrt( (m_pi² + m_mu²)^2 / (4 m_pi²) )\n\n= (m_pi² + m_mu²)/(2 m_pi )\n\nSo E_mu' = (m_pi² + m_mu²)/(2 m_pi )\n\nThen, substituting into p_mu_lab_x:\n\np_mu_lab_x ≈ gamma (p' + beta E_mu') \n\nBut beta ≈ 1, so:\n\np_mu_lab_x ≈ gamma (p' + E_mu') \n\ngamma ≈ p/(m_pi c)\n\nSo:\n\np_mu_lab_x ≈ (p/(m_pi c)) [ ( (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi) ) + ( (m_pi² + m_mu²)/(2 m_pi) ) ) ]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n[ (m_pi² - m_mu² + m_pi² + m_mu² ) / (2 m_pi) ) ]\n\n= (2 m_pi²) / (2 m_pi) ) = m_pi / 1\n\nSo:\n\np_mu_lab_x ≈ (p/(m_pi c)) * (m_pi) ) = p / c\n\nBut since we're working in units where c=1 (probably), then p_mu_lab_x ≈ p. Wait, but the pion's momentum is p, so the muon's maximum momentum is approximately p. But that seems too simplistic. Wait, but in the ultrarelativistic limit, when the pion is moving very fast, and the muon is emitted in the same direction, then yes, the muon's momentum would be approximately the pion's momentum plus its own momentum from the rest frame. But maybe there's a more precise expression. \n\nWait, but in reality, the muon's momentum in the lab frame when emitted forward would be gamma (p' + beta E_mu'). Since gamma is approximately p/(m_pi c), and beta is approximately 1. Then:\n\ngamma (p' + E_mu') = (p/(m_pi c)) [ ( (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi) ) + ( (m_pi² + m_mu²)/(2 m_pi) ) ) ]\n\nAs before, this simplifies to (p/(m_pi c)) * (m_pi) ) = p/c. If c=1, then p. But the pion's momentum is p, so the muon's maximum momentum is p. But that can't be right because the pion's mass is m_pi, and the muon's mass is m_mu. Wait, but in the ultrarelativistic limit, the maximum momentum of the muon would approach the pion's momentum. But maybe there's a correction term. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to consider that when boosting, the muon's momentum in the lab frame is given by:\n\np_mu_lab = gamma (p' + beta gamma_mu m_mu )\n\nWait, no. Let me recall the Lorentz transformation for momentum. The exact formula is:\n\np_parallel = gamma (p'_parallel + beta E'_mu / c )\n\np_perp = p'_perp / gamma \n\nBut since in the rest frame, the muon's momentum is p' in some direction. Let's take the case where it's emitted along the direction of motion (parallel). Then p'_parallel = p', and p'_perp = 0. Then:\n\np_parallel = gamma (p' + beta E'_mu / c )\n\nBut E'_mu = sqrt( (p')² c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) / c² ?\n\nWait, units can be confusing. Let's define E'_mu in units where c=1. Then E'_mu = sqrt( p'^2 + m_mu^2 )\n\nSo, in the lab frame, the parallel momentum is:\n\np_parallel = gamma (p' + beta E'_mu )\n\nSimilarly, the energy transforms as:\n\nE_mu_lab = gamma (E'_mu + beta p' )\n\nBut since beta ≈ 1 and gamma ≈ p/(m_pi), let's plug in the values. \n\nFirst, compute p' and E'_mu:\n\np' = (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi )\n\nE'_mu = (m_pi² + m_mu²)/(2 m_pi )\n\nSo, substituting into p_parallel:\n\np_parallel ≈ gamma [ p' + E'_mu ]\n\n= gamma [ (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi ) + (m_pi² + m_mu²)/(2 m_pi ) ]\n\n= gamma [ (2 m_pi²)/(2 m_pi ) ]\n\n= gamma ( m_pi )\n\nBut gamma is approximately p/(m_pi), so:\n\np_parallel ≈ (p/m_pi) * m_pi ) = p\n\nSo the maximum momentum is approximately p. Similarly, if the muon is emitted opposite to the boost direction (theta' = pi), then p'_parallel = -p', and:\n\np_parallel = gamma ( -p' + beta E'_mu )\n\n= gamma ( -p' + E'_mu ) since beta ≈1\n\n= gamma [ - (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi ) + (m_pi² + m_mu²)/(2 m_pi ) ]\n\n= gamma [ ( -m_pi² + m_mu² + m_pi² + m_mu² ) / (2 m_pi ) ]\n\n= gamma [ (2 m_mu² ) / (2 m_pi ) ]\n\n= gamma ( m_mu² / m_pi )\n\nBut gamma ≈ p/m_pi, so:\n\np_parallel ≈ (p/m_pi) * (m_mu² / m_pi ) = p m_mu² / m_pi²\n\nBut since p >> m_pi, m_mu, this term is much smaller than p. So the minimum momentum is approximately (p m_mu²)/m_pi². \n\nBut wait, the problem states to express the answer in terms of m_mu, m_pi, and p, assuming p >> m_mu, m_pi. So the minimum momentum is (m_mu² / m_pi²) p, and the maximum is p. \n\nBut let me check if this makes sense. In the ultrarelativistic limit, when the pion is moving very fast, the muon emitted forward would carry almost all the momentum, and the one emitted backward would have a small momentum proportional to (m_mu² / m_pi²) p. That seems plausible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more precise way to derive this. Let's consider the decay in the lab frame. The pion has energy E_pi = sqrt(p² + m_pi²) ≈ p + m_pi²/(2p) for p >> m_pi. But maybe using conservation of energy and momentum in the lab frame. \n\nBut that might be complicated. Alternatively, using the fact that in the lab frame, the minimum and maximum momenta of the muon occur when the muon is emitted in the direction of the pion's motion (maximum) or opposite (minimum). \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the maximum and minimum momentum in a two-body decay when the parent particle is moving. The general formula for the maximum and minimum momentum of a decay product in the lab frame can be found using the relation:\n\np_min = ( (E_pi - p_pi) * m_mu² ) / (2 m_pi² )\n\nWait, I might need to recall the formula for the maximum and minimum momentum in a two-body decay. \n\nIn the rest frame of the parent particle (pion), the decay products (muon and neutrino) have fixed energies and momenta. When boosted to the lab frame, the maximum and minimum momenta of the muon can be found using the Lorentz transformation. \n\nThe maximum occurs when the muon is emitted in the same direction as the parent's motion, and the minimum when it's emitted opposite. \n\nThe formula for the maximum momentum is:\n\np_max = (E_pi + p_pi) * (E_mu' + p_mu') / (2 m_pi )\n\nSimilarly, the minimum momentum is:\n\np_min = (E_pi - p_pi) * (E_mu' - p_mu') / (2 m_pi )\n\nBut since E_mu' = (m_pi² + m_mu²)/(2 m_pi ), and p_mu' = (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi )\n\nSo substituting:\n\np_max = (E_pi + p_pi) * [ (m_pi² + m_mu²)/(2 m_pi ) + (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi ) ] / (2 m_pi )\n\nSimplify the numerator inside:\n\n[ (m_pi² + m_mu² + m_pi² - m_mu² ) / (2 m_pi ) ] = [ 2 m_pi² / (2 m_pi ) ] = m_pi / 1\n\nSo p_max = (E_pi + p_pi) * (m_pi ) / (2 m_pi ) ) = (E_pi + p_pi)/2\n\nSimilarly, p_min = (E_pi - p_pi) * [ (m_pi² + m_mu²)/(2 m_pi ) - (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi ) ] / (2 m_pi )\n\nInside the brackets:\n\n[ (m_pi² + m_mu² - m_pi² + m_mu² ) / (2 m_pi ) ] = [ 2 m_mu² / (2 m_pi ) ] = m_mu² / m_pi\n\nSo p_min = (E_pi - p_pi) * (m_mu² / m_pi ) / (2 m_pi ) ) = (E_pi - p_pi) m_mu² / (2 m_pi² )\n\nBut in the ultrarelativistic limit where E_pi ≈ p_pi ≈ p (since p >> m_pi), then:\n\np_max ≈ (p + p)/2 = p\n\np_min ≈ (p - p) m_mu² / (2 m_pi² ) = 0? Wait, but that can't be. Wait, no, in reality, E_pi - p_pi is not zero even when p >> m_pi. Let's compute E_pi - p_pi. \n\nE_pi = sqrt(p² + m_pi²) ≈ p + m_pi²/(2p)\n\nSo E_pi - p_pi ≈ (p + m_pi²/(2p)) - p = m_pi²/(2p)\n\nTherefore, p_min ≈ (m_pi²/(2p)) * (m_mu² / (2 m_pi² )) ) = m_mu²/(4 p )\n\nWait, but this contradicts the earlier result. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's re-examine the formula. \n\nWait, the general formula for p_min and p_max in the lab frame when the parent is moving is:\n\np_max = [ (E_pi + p_pi) * (E_mu' + p_mu') ] / (2 m_pi )\n\np_min = [ (E_pi - p_pi) * (E_mu' - p_mu') ] / (2 m_pi )\n\nBut substituting E_mu' and p_mu':\n\nE_mu' + p_mu' = [ (m_pi² + m_mu²) + (m_pi² - m_mu²) ] / (2 m_pi ) = (2 m_pi² ) / (2 m_pi ) = m_pi\n\nSimilarly, E_mu' - p_mu' = [ (m_pi² + m_mu²) - (m_pi² - m_mu²) ] / (2 m_pi ) = (2 m_mu² ) / (2 m_pi ) = m_mu² / m_pi\n\nTherefore:\n\np_max = (E_pi + p_pi) * m_pi / (2 m_pi ) ) = (E_pi + p_pi)/2\n\np_min = (E_pi - p_pi) * (m_mu² / m_pi ) / (2 m_pi ) ) = (E_pi - p_pi) m_mu² / (2 m_pi² )\n\nNow, substituting E_pi ≈ p + m_pi²/(2p), and p_pi ≈ p - m_pi²/(2p) (since p_pi = sqrt(E_pi² - m_pi²) ≈ sqrt( (p + m_pi²/(2p))² - m_pi² ) ≈ sqrt( p² + m_pi² + ... - m_pi² )? Wait, maybe better to use the expansion for E_pi = sqrt(p² + m_pi²) ≈ p (1 + m_pi²/(2 p² )) )\n\nSimilarly, p_pi = p (since in the lab frame, the pion's momentum is p). Wait, no. Wait, the pion's momentum in the lab frame is p. So p_pi = p. Then E_pi = sqrt(p² + m_pi²) ≈ p + m_pi²/(2p). \n\nSo E_pi + p_pi ≈ p + m_pi²/(2p) + p = 2p + m_pi²/(2p)\n\nThen p_max = (2p + m_pi²/(2p))/2 = p + m_pi²/(4p)\n\nBut since p >> m_pi, the term m_pi²/(4p) is negligible, so p_max ≈ p\n\nSimilarly, E_pi - p_pi ≈ (p + m_pi²/(2p)) - p = m_pi²/(2p)\n\nSo p_min = (m_pi²/(2p)) * (m_mu²)/(2 m_pi² ) ) = m_mu²/(4 p )\n\nBut the problem states to express the answer in terms of m_mu, m_pi, and p. So the minimum momentum is m_mu²/(4p) and maximum is p. But wait, this contradicts the earlier result where we had p_min ≈ p m_mu² / m_pi². Which one is correct?\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. Let's check the units. The formula gives p_min = (E_pi - p_pi) m_mu² / (2 m_pi² )\n\nBut E_pi and p_pi have units of energy and momentum (assuming c=1). So (E_pi - p_pi) has units of energy. Then m_mu² / m_pi² is dimensionless. So the units of p_min would be energy * (mass² / mass² ) = energy. But momentum has units of energy in units where c=1. So it's okay. \n\nBut in the ultrarelativistic limit, E_pi ≈ p_pi + m_pi²/(2 p_pi )\n\nSo E_pi - p_pi ≈ m_pi²/(2 p_pi )\n\nTherefore, p_min ≈ (m_pi²/(2 p )) * (m_mu²)/(2 m_pi² ) ) = m_mu²/(4 p )\n\nBut the problem says to express in terms of m_mu, m_pi, and p. So the minimum momentum is m_mu²/(4 p ), and maximum is p. But wait, this seems different from the earlier approach where we had p_min ≈ p m_mu² / m_pi². Which is correct?\n\nWait, let's plug in some numbers. Suppose m_pi is 140 MeV, m_mu is 105 MeV, and p is very large, say 10 GeV. Then according to the first approach, p_min ≈ p m_mu² / m_pi² = 10 GeV * (105)^2 / (140)^2 ≈ 10 GeV * (11025)/(19600) ≈ 10 GeV * 0.56 ≈ 5.6 GeV. But according to the second approach, p_min ≈ m_mu²/(4 p ) = (105 MeV)^2 / (4 * 10 GeV ) = (11025 MeV² ) / (40,000 MeV ) ≈ 0.275 MeV. These are vastly different. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, clearly there's a mistake here. Let's think again. The formula p_min = (E_pi - p_pi) m_mu² / (2 m_pi² )\n\nBut E_pi - p_pi = sqrt(p² + m_pi²) - p ≈ m_pi²/(2p )\n\nSo p_min ≈ (m_pi²/(2p )) * (m_mu²)/(2 m_pi² ) ) = m_mu²/(4p )\n\nBut in the example with p=10 GeV=10,000 MeV, m_mu=105 MeV, then p_min ≈ (105)^2/(4*10,000) ≈ 11025/40,000 ≈ 0.275 MeV. But this seems too small. However, in the rest frame, the muon's momentum is p' = (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi ) ≈ (140² - 105²)/(2*140 ) ≈ (19600 - 11025)/280 ≈ 8575/280 ≈ 30.625 MeV/c. Then, when boosted back, the minimum momentum would be when the muon is emitted opposite to the boost. Using the Lorentz transformation:\n\np_mu_lab = gamma ( -p' + beta E_mu' )\n\nWith gamma ≈ p/m_pi ≈ 10,000/140 ≈ 71.43\n\nBeta ≈ 1\n\nE_mu' = sqrt( p'^2 + m_mu^2 ) ≈ sqrt(30.625² + 105² ) ≈ sqrt(938 + 11025 ) ≈ sqrt(11963 ) ≈ 109.4 MeV\n\nSo p_mu_lab ≈ 71.43 ( -30.625 + 109.4 ) ≈ 71.43 * 78.775 ≈ 71.43 * 78 ≈ 5571 MeV ≈ 5.57 GeV\n\nWhich matches the first approach's result. So there's a contradiction here. The formula from the general decay gives p_min ≈ 0.275 MeV, but the actual calculation using Lorentz transformation gives ~5.57 GeV. Clearly, the formula must be wrong. \n\nWait, where did I get that general formula from? Maybe I confused the formula. Let me check again. \n\nThe correct approach is to use the Lorentz transformation. Let's do it step by step. \n\nIn the pion rest frame, the muon has momentum p' = (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi )\n\nWhen we boost to the lab frame where the pion has momentum p, the Lorentz factor gamma is E_pi / m_pi ≈ p/m_pi (since E_pi ≈ p for p >> m_pi )\n\nThe velocity beta is v/c ≈ 1. \n\nThe muon's momentum in the lab frame when emitted opposite to the boost direction (theta' = pi) is:\n\np_mu_lab = gamma ( -p' + beta E_mu' )\n\nE_mu' = sqrt( p'^2 + m_mu^2 ) = (m_pi² + m_mu²)/(2 m_pi )\n\nSo:\n\np_mu_lab ≈ gamma ( -p' + E_mu' )\n\n= gamma [ - (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi ) + (m_pi² + m_mu²)/(2 m_pi ) ]\n\n= gamma [ ( -m_pi² + m_mu² + m_pi² + m_mu² ) / (2 m_pi ) ]\n\n= gamma [ (2 m_mu² ) / (2 m_pi ) ]\n\n= gamma ( m_mu² / m_pi )\n\nBut gamma ≈ p/m_pi, so:\n\np_mu_lab ≈ (p/m_pi ) * (m_mu² / m_pi ) = p m_mu² / m_pi²\n\nWhich gives p_min = p m_mu² / m_pi²\n\nSimilarly, when emitted forward, p_mu_lab ≈ p + (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi ) * gamma ≈ p + (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi ) * (p/m_pi ) ≈ p + p (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi² )\n\nBut since p >> m_pi, this term is negligible compared to p, so p_max ≈ p\n\nTherefore, the correct minimum momentum is p m_mu² / m_pi² and maximum is p. \n\nSo the answer to part (a) is that the minimum momentum of the muon is (m_mu² / m_pi²) p and the maximum is p. \n\nBut wait, in the example with p=10 GeV, m_pi=140 MeV, m_mu=105 MeV, then p_min = 10 GeV * (105/140)^2 = 10 GeV * (0.75)^2 = 10 GeV * 0.5625 = 5.625 GeV, which matches the Lorentz transformation result. So the correct formula is p_min = p (m_mu/m_pi )² and p_max = p. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nMinimum momentum: (m_mu² / m_pi²) p\n\nMaximum momentum: p\n\nSo boxed answers would be:\n\nMinimum: \\boxed{ \\frac{m_\\mu^2}{m_\\pi^2} p }\n\nMaximum: \\boxed{ p }\n\nBut the question asks for the value of the minimum and maximum momentum. So both need to be provided. \n\nMoving to part (b): If the neutrino in pion decay has negative helicity, what is the helicity of the muon?\n\nHelicity is the projection of spin onto the direction of momentum. For the pion decay: π^+ → μ^+ + ν_1\n\nThe pion has spin 0, so the muon and neutrino must have opposite spins to conserve angular momentum. Since the neutrino is left-handed (negative helicity), the muon must also have negative helicity. Wait, but wait. The pion is spin 0, so the total angular momentum of the decay products must be zero. The muon and neutrino are emitted in opposite directions. The neutrino is ν_1, which in the Standard Model, is a left-handed neutrino (negative helicity). The muon is μ^+, which is a charged lepton. For charged leptons, helicity is not conserved, but in the limit of high energy (massless), they would have definite helicity. However, the muon is massive, so its helicity depends on its motion. \n\nBut in the pion rest frame, the muon and neutrino are emitted back-to-back. The neutrino has negative helicity (left-handed), so its spin is opposite to its momentum. To conserve angular momentum, the muon must have its spin opposite to the neutrino's spin. Since the neutrino's spin is opposite to its momentum, the muon's spin should be in the same direction as its own momentum. But wait, the total spin must be zero. \n\nWait, the pion has spin 0. The decay products must have total angular momentum J=0. Since they are emitted in opposite directions, their orbital angular momentum is zero (s-wave). Therefore, their spins must be opposite. The neutrino is left-handed (spin opposite to momentum), so its spin is in the opposite direction to its momentum. The muon, being a fermion, must have its spin in the same direction as its momentum to cancel the neutrino's spin. But the muon is a μ^+, which is a particle. For antiparticles, the helicity is opposite. Wait, no. Helicity is the same for particles and antiparticles, but the weak interaction couples to left-handed particles and right-handed antiparticles. \n\nWait, the decay π^+ → μ^+ + ν_μ\n\nThe pion is a pseudoscalar meson, so the decay must proceed via the weak interaction. The neutrino emitted here is a muon neutrino ν_μ. In the Standard Model, the weak interaction couples to left-handed particles and right-handed antiparticles. So the ν_μ is left-handed (negative helicity). The μ^+ is the antiparticle of the μ^-, so it couples as a right-handed particle. But helicity is a frame-dependent quantity. However, in the limit where the muon is relativistic, its helicity is approximately equal to its chirality. \n\nBut in the pion rest frame, the muon is not necessarily relativistic. The pion mass is about 140 MeV, and the muon mass is about 105 MeV. So the muon's speed in the pion rest frame is non-relativistic. Wait, no. Let's compute the muon's speed. \n\nIn the pion rest frame, the muon's energy is E_mu = (m_pi² + m_mu²)/(2 m_pi )\n\nFor m_pi = 140 MeV, m_mu = 105 MeV:\n\nE_mu = (140² + 105²)/(2*140 ) = (19600 + 11025)/280 = 30625/280 ≈ 109.375 MeV\n\nThe muon's momentum p_mu = (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi ) = (19600 - 11025)/280 = 8575/280 ≈ 30.625 MeV/c\n\nThe velocity beta = p_mu c / E_mu ≈ (30.625 / 109.375 ) ≈ 0.28. So the muon is moving at about 28% the speed of light, which is non-relativistic but not extremely slow. \n\nIn this case, the helicity of the muon is not exactly equal to its chirality. However, the decay of the pion must conserve angular momentum. Since the pion has spin 0, the total angular momentum of the muon and neutrino must be zero. The neutrino is left-handed (spin opposite to momentum), so its spin is -1/2 in the direction of motion. To cancel this, the muon must have spin +1/2 in the same direction. But the muon's spin is in the direction of its motion, so its helicity is +1/2 (positive helicity). Wait, but the muon is a μ^+, which is an antiparticle. \n\nWait, in weak interactions, the charged current for the decay π^+ → μ^+ ν_μ involves the creation of a μ^+ and a ν_μ. The interaction term is proportional to the charged current J^+ = \\bar{\\nu}_μ γ^μ (1 - γ^5) μ^+. The (1 - γ^5) projects out the right-handed component of the μ^+ (since for antiparticles, the left-handed chirality corresponds to right-handed helicity). However, in the pion rest frame, the muon is not ultra-relativistic, so its helicity is not exactly equal to its chirality. \n\nBut the question states that the neutrino has negative helicity. Given that, what is the helicity of the muon? \n\nSince the total angular momentum must be zero, the spins of the muon and neutrino must be opposite. The neutrino has negative helicity (spin opposite to momentum), so its spin is -1/2. The muon must have spin +1/2. But the muon's momentum is opposite to the neutrino's momentum (since they are back-to-back). So the muon's spin is +1/2 in its own direction of motion, which means its helicity is +1/2 (positive helicity). \n\nBut wait, the muon is moving in the opposite direction to the neutrino. Let's clarify. In the pion rest frame, the neutrino and muon are emitted in opposite directions. Suppose the neutrino is moving in the +z direction with negative helicity (spin -1/2). The muon is moving in the -z direction. To have total spin zero, the muon must have spin +1/2. But the muon's helicity is the projection of its spin onto its direction of motion. Since it's moving in the -z direction, its helicity is (spin_z) * (direction of motion). If the spin is +1/2 (along +z), and the motion is along -z, then the helicity is (+1/2) * (-1) = -1/2.

{"id": "atomic/4-49", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the momentum and kinetic energy of the pions given that their mean lifetime at rest is 2.6e-8 seconds, they travel 10 meters, and 10% decay. Hmm. Alright, so first, the problem involves relativistic time dilation because the pions are moving at high speeds, right? Their lifetime in the lab frame will be longer than the proper lifetime. \n\nThe mean lifetime at rest is the proper time, τ = 2.6e-8 s. When they're moving, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame is γτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor. The distance they travel is 10 meters, so the time it takes in the lab frame for them to travel that distance is t = distance / speed = L / v. But during this time, 10% of them decay. So the survival probability is related to the exponential decay law. \n\nThe survival probability N/N0 = e^(-t/(γτ)) = 0.9, since 10% decay, so 90% remain. So we can set up the equation: 0.9 = e^(-t/(γτ)). Taking natural logarithm on both sides: ln(0.9) = -t/(γτ). Therefore, t = -γτ ln(0.9). But t is also equal to L / v. So combining these: L / v = -γτ ln(0.9). \n\nBut γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So we have variables v and γ here. Let me express γ in terms of v. Let's denote β = v/c, so γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). Then, substituting into the equation: L / (β c) = -γ τ ln(0.9). Let's plug in the numbers. L is 10 meters, τ is 2.6e-8 seconds, ln(0.9) is approximately -0.10536. So:\n\n10 / (β c) = γ * 2.6e-8 * 0.10536\n\nWait, because ln(0.9) is negative, so when we take the absolute value, the equation becomes L/(β c) = γ τ (-ln(0.9)). So substituting numbers:\n\n10 / (β * 3e8 m/s) = γ * 2.6e-8 s * 0.10536\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side first. 2.6e-8 * 0.10536 ≈ 2.6e-8 * 0.105 ≈ 2.73e-9. So:\n\nLeft side: 10 / (β * 3e8) = 10 / (3e8 β) ≈ 3.333e-8 / β\n\nRight side: γ * 2.73e-9\n\nSo setting them equal:\n\n3.333e-8 / β = γ * 2.73e-9\n\nDivide both sides by 2.73e-9:\n\n(3.333e-8 / β) / 2.73e-9 ≈ (3.333 / 2.73) * (1e-8 / 1e-9) / β ≈ (1.22) * 10 / β ≈ 12.2 / β\n\nSo 12.2 / β = γ\n\nBut γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). Therefore:\n\n12.2 / β = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²)\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(12.2)^2 / β² = 1 / (1 - β²)\n\nCompute (12.2)^2: 12*12=144, 0.2^2=0.04, 2*12*0.2=4.8, so total 144 + 4.8 + 0.04 = 148.84\n\nSo 148.84 / β² = 1 / (1 - β²)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n148.84 (1 - β²) = β²\n\n148.84 - 148.84 β² = β²\n\n148.84 = β² + 148.84 β² = β² (1 + 148.84) = β² * 149.84\n\nTherefore, β² = 148.84 / 149.84 ≈ 0.9933\n\nSo β ≈ sqrt(0.9933) ≈ 0.9966\n\nSo β ≈ 0.9966, which is v ≈ 0.9966c\n\nNow, compute γ. Since γ = 12.2 / β ≈ 12.2 / 0.9966 ≈ 12.24\n\nSo γ ≈ 12.24\n\nNow, the momentum of the pion is p = γ m v, where m is the rest mass. But wait, relativistic momentum is p = γ m v. But m for a pion is about 139 MeV/c² for charged pions (π+ and π-). Wait, let me confirm: the rest mass of a charged pion is approximately 139.57 MeV/c². So m = 139.57 MeV/c².\n\nSo p = γ m v = γ m β c. Since β = v/c, so v = β c. Therefore, p = γ β m c. But m c is in units of MeV/c² * c = MeV/c. So m c = 139.57 MeV/c² * c = 139.57 MeV/c. Therefore, p = γ β * 139.57 MeV/c.\n\nPlugging in γ ≈ 12.24 and β ≈ 0.9966:\n\np ≈ 12.24 * 0.9966 * 139.57 MeV/c\n\nFirst compute 12.24 * 0.9966 ≈ 12.24 * 1 ≈ 12.24, but since 0.9966 is slightly less than 1, maybe 12.24 * 0.9966 ≈ 12.19\n\nThen 12.19 * 139.57 ≈ Let's compute 12 * 140 = 1680, 0.19 * 140 ≈ 26.6, so total ≈ 1680 + 26.6 ≈ 1706.6 MeV/c. But since 139.57 is slightly less than 140, maybe subtract 12.19 * 0.43 ≈ 5.24. So 1706.6 - 5.24 ≈ 1701.36 MeV/c. So approximately 1701 MeV/c. But let me compute more accurately:\n\n12.24 * 0.9966 = 12.24 * (1 - 0.0034) ≈ 12.24 - 12.24*0.0034 ≈ 12.24 - 0.0416 ≈ 12.1984\n\n12.1984 * 139.57:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n12 * 139.57 = 1674.84\n\n0.1984 * 139.57 ≈ 0.1 * 139.57 = 13.957; 0.0984 * 139.57 ≈ ~13.75\n\nSo total ≈ 13.957 + 13.75 ≈ 27.707\n\nSo total p ≈ 1674.84 + 27.707 ≈ 1702.55 MeV/c\n\nSo approximately 1703 MeV/c. Converting to standard units, 1 MeV/c ≈ 5.344286×10^-22 kg·m/s. But since the answer is expected in MeV/c, maybe we can leave it as MeV/c. But the problem says \"Find the momentum and kinetic energy\", so perhaps in units of MeV/c and MeV.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the momentum in kg·m/s? Let me check. The problem doesn't specify, but in particle physics, momentum is often expressed in MeV/c. So probably acceptable. But let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe convert to kg·m/s. Let's do that. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1 MeV = 1.602e-13 J. Then, 1 MeV/c = (1.602e-13 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 1.602e-13 / 3e8 ≈ 5.34e-22 kg·m/s. So 1703 MeV/c * 5.34e-22 kg·m/s per MeV/c ≈ 1703 * 5.34e-22 ≈ 9.09e-19 kg·m/s. But that's a very small number, but maybe correct. However, in high energy physics, using natural units where c=1, so expressing momentum in MeV/c is standard. So perhaps the answer is 1700 MeV/c or so. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of γ. Let me verify the steps again.\n\nWe had the equation: L / (β c) = γ τ (-ln(0.9))\n\nGiven L = 10 m, τ = 2.6e-8 s, ln(0.9) ≈ -0.10536.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n10 / (β * 3e8) = γ * 2.6e-8 * 0.10536\n\nCompute the right-hand side: 2.6e-8 * 0.10536 ≈ 2.6e-8 * 0.1 = 2.6e-9, 2.6e-8 * 0.00536 ≈ 1.39e-10, total ≈ 2.6e-9 + 1.39e-10 ≈ 2.739e-9. So right-hand side is γ * 2.739e-9.\n\nLeft-hand side: 10 / (β * 3e8) ≈ 10 / (3e8 β) ≈ 3.333e-8 / β.\n\nSo 3.333e-8 / β = γ * 2.739e-9\n\nDivide both sides by 2.739e-9:\n\n(3.333e-8 / 2.739e-9) / β ≈ (12.166) / β = γ\n\nSo γ ≈ 12.166 / β\n\nBut γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). So:\n\n12.166 / β = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(12.166)^2 / β² = 1 / (1 - β²)\n\n12.166^2 ≈ (12 + 0.166)^2 = 144 + 2*12*0.166 + 0.166^2 ≈ 144 + 3.984 + 0.027556 ≈ 147.011556\n\nSo 147.011556 / β² = 1 / (1 - β²)\n\nMultiply both sides by β² (1 - β²):\n\n147.011556 (1 - β²) = β²\n\n147.011556 - 147.011556 β² = β²\n\n147.011556 = β² + 147.011556 β² = β² (1 + 147.011556) = β² * 148.011556\n\nThus, β² = 147.011556 / 148.011556 ≈ 0.99324\n\nTherefore, β ≈ sqrt(0.99324) ≈ 0.9966, which matches the previous result.\n\nThen γ ≈ 12.166 / 0.9966 ≈ 12.21\n\nSo γ ≈ 12.21\n\nSo then, momentum p = γ β m c. m is the pion mass, which is approximately 139.57 MeV/c². So:\n\np = 12.21 * 0.9966 * 139.57 MeV/c\n\nCompute 12.21 * 0.9966 ≈ 12.21 * 1 - 12.21 * 0.0034 ≈ 12.21 - 0.0415 ≈ 12.1685\n\nThen 12.1685 * 139.57 ≈ Let's compute 12 * 139.57 = 1674.84, 0.1685 * 139.57 ≈ 0.1 * 139.57 = 13.957, 0.06 * 139.57 ≈ 8.374, 0.0085 * 139.57 ≈ 1.186. So total ≈ 13.957 + 8.374 + 1.186 ≈ 23.517. So total p ≈ 1674.84 + 23.517 ≈ 1698.36 MeV/c. So approximately 1698 MeV/c. Rounding to three significant figures, 1.70e3 MeV/c, so 1700 MeV/c. Hmm, but maybe more precise calculation is needed.\n\nAlternatively, use calculator steps:\n\n12.21 * 0.9966 = let's compute 12 * 0.9966 = 11.9592, 0.21 * 0.9966 = 0.209286, total 11.9592 + 0.209286 = 12.168486\n\nThen 12.168486 * 139.57:\n\n12 * 139.57 = 1674.84\n\n0.168486 * 139.57:\n\n0.1 * 139.57 = 13.957\n\n0.06 * 139.57 = 8.3742\n\n0.008486 * 139.57 ≈ 1.185 (since 0.008 * 139.57 = 1.11656, 0.000486 * 139.57 ≈ 0.0678, total ≈ 1.11656 + 0.0678 ≈ 1.18436)\n\nSo total 13.957 + 8.3742 + 1.18436 ≈ 23.51556\n\nThus, total p ≈ 1674.84 + 23.51556 ≈ 1698.36 MeV/c. So approximately 1698 MeV/c. So about 1.7e3 MeV/c. So 1.7 GeV/c.\n\nBut maybe the exact value is needed. Let's see. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an answer in kg·m/s. Let's compute that as well.\n\nGiven p = 1698.36 MeV/c. Using 1 MeV/c = 5.344286×10^-22 kg·m/s.\n\nSo 1698.36 MeV/c * 5.344286e-22 kg·m/s per MeV/c ≈ 1698.36 * 5.344286e-22 ≈ Let's compute 1700 * 5.34e-22 ≈ 9.078e-19 kg·m/s. But precise calculation:\n\n1698.36 * 5.344286e-22 ≈ (1700 - 1.64) * 5.344286e-22 ≈ 1700*5.344286e-22 - 1.64*5.344286e-22 ≈ 9.085286e-19 - 8.77e-22 ≈ 9.085286e-19 - 0.000877e-19 ≈ 9.0844e-19 kg·m/s. So approximately 9.08e-19 kg·m/s. But again, in particle physics, using MeV/c is more standard.\n\nNow, the kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is (γ - 1) m c². Since m c² for the pion is 139.57 MeV. So KE = (12.21 - 1) * 139.57 MeV ≈ 11.21 * 139.57 ≈ Let's compute 10 * 139.57 = 1395.7, 1.21 * 139.57 ≈ 168.88, total ≈ 1395.7 + 168.88 ≈ 1564.58 MeV. So approximately 1565 MeV, or 1.565 GeV.\n\nBut let's check the exact calculation:\n\nγ = 12.21, so γ -1 = 11.21\n\n11.21 * 139.57 ≈ 11 * 139.57 = 1535.27, 0.21 * 139.57 ≈ 29.31, total ≈ 1535.27 + 29.31 ≈ 1564.58 MeV. So yes, approximately 1565 MeV.\n\nBut wait, let's check if the value of γ is exactly 12.21. Earlier steps gave γ ≈ 12.21. Let's verify:\n\nFrom β ≈ 0.9966, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.99324) = 1 / sqrt(0.00676) ≈ 1 / 0.0822 ≈ 12.16. Wait, this is conflicting with the previous calculation. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, β² = 0.99324, so 1 - β² = 0.00676. sqrt(0.00676) ≈ 0.0822. So γ = 1 / 0.0822 ≈ 12.16. But earlier, we had γ ≈ 12.21. There's a discrepancy here. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let's recalculate γ from β. If β = sqrt(0.99324) ≈ 0.9966, then 1 - β² = 0.00676. sqrt(0.00676) = 0.0822. So 1 / 0.0822 ≈ 12.16. But earlier, from the equation γ = 12.166 / β. Since β ≈ 0.9966, 12.166 / 0.9966 ≈ 12.21. So which is correct?\n\nWait, there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct? Let's check the algebra.\n\nWe had the equation:\n\nγ = 12.166 / β\n\nBut also, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²)\n\nSo substituting β = sqrt(0.99324) ≈ 0.9966 into γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) gives γ ≈ 12.16. But according to the previous equation, γ = 12.166 / β ≈ 12.166 / 0.9966 ≈ 12.21. Which is correct?\n\nWait, this suggests an inconsistency. Which step is wrong?\n\nWait, let's go back to the equation:\n\nFrom L / (β c) = γ τ (-ln(0.9))\n\nWe found γ = (L / (β c)) / (τ (-ln(0.9)))\n\nBut substituting the numbers:\n\nL = 10 m, β c = v, τ = 2.6e-8 s, -ln(0.9) ≈ 0.10536\n\nSo γ = (10 / (β * 3e8)) / (2.6e-8 * 0.10536)\n\nCompute denominator: 2.6e-8 * 0.10536 ≈ 2.739e-9\n\nSo γ = (10 / (β * 3e8)) / 2.739e-9 ≈ (10 / (3e8 β)) / 2.739e-9 ≈ (10 / (3e8 * β)) * (1 / 2.739e-9) ≈ 10 / (3e8 * β * 2.739e-9) ≈ 10 / (8.217e-17 * β) ≈ 1.217e16 / β\n\nWait, wait, that can't be. Wait, 3e8 * 2.739e-9 = 3e8 * 2.739e-9 = 3 * 2.739 * 1e-1 = 8.217 * 0.1 = 0.8217. So denominator is 0.8217 * β. So γ = 10 / (0.8217 * β) ≈ 12.166 / β. So that's correct.\n\nBut when we calculated β from the equation, we found β ≈ 0.9966, so γ ≈ 12.166 / 0.9966 ≈ 12.21. However, when we compute γ directly from β, we get γ ≈ 12.16. This inconsistency suggests an error in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of β. Let's redo the step where we solved for β.\n\nWe had:\n\n(12.166 / β)^2 = 1 / (1 - β²)\n\nWhich led to:\n\n(12.166)^2 / β² = 1 / (1 - β²)\n\nThen:\n\n(12.166)^2 (1 - β²) = β²\n\n(12.166)^2 - (12.166)^2 β² = β²\n\n(12.166)^2 = β² [1 + (12.166)^2]\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, expanding:\n\nLeft side: (12.166)^2 (1 - β²) = β²\n\nSo (12.166)^2 - (12.166)^2 β² = β²\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n(12.166)^2 = β² + (12.166)^2 β²\n\nFactor β²:\n\n(12.166)^2 = β² [1 + (12.166)^2]\n\nTherefore:\n\nβ² = (12.166)^2 / [1 + (12.166)^2]\n\nCompute denominator: 1 + (12.166)^2 ≈ 1 + 148 = 149\n\nSo β² ≈ 148 / 149 ≈ 0.9932886\n\nThus, β ≈ sqrt(0.9932886) ≈ 0.9966\n\nThen, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(0.0067114) ≈ 1 / 0.08192 ≈ 12.21\n\nWait, sqrt(0.0067114) ≈ 0.08192. So 1 / 0.08192 ≈ 12.21. So that's correct. So γ is indeed approximately 12.21. So earlier calculation of γ from β was wrong because I miscalculated sqrt(1 - β²). Let me recalculate:\n\n1 - β² = 1 - 0.9932886 = 0.0067114\n\nsqrt(0.0067114) ≈ 0.08192\n\nThus, γ = 1 / 0.08192 ≈ 12.21. So that's correct. So previous error was mine in calculating sqrt(0.00676) as 0.0822, but actually 1 - β² is 0.0067114, whose sqrt is 0.08192. So γ is indeed 12.21. Therefore, the momentum calculation is correct.\n\nSo p ≈ 12.21 * 0.9966 * 139.57 ≈ 12.21 * 0.9966 ≈ 12.168, then 12.168 * 139.57 ≈ 1698 MeV/c. So approximately 1700 MeV/c.\n\nFor the kinetic energy, KE = (γ - 1) m c² = (12.21 - 1) * 139.57 MeV ≈ 11.21 * 139.57 ≈ 1565 MeV.\n\nBut let's check with more precise γ. If γ is exactly 12.21, then:\n\nKE = (12.21 - 1) * 139.57 = 11.21 * 139.57\n\n11 * 139.57 = 1535.27\n\n0.21 * 139.57 = 29.3097\n\nTotal KE = 1535.27 + 29.3097 = 1564.58 MeV ≈ 1565 MeV.\n\nSo the kinetic energy is approximately 1565 MeV.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Find the momentum and kinetic energy of the pions.\" So we need to present both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in different units, like using the rest mass in kg and calculating SI units. Let's check.\n\nThe rest mass of a pion is about 139.57 MeV/c². To convert to kg, we can use 1 MeV/c² = 1.7827e-30 kg. So m = 139.57 * 1.7827e-30 ≈ 2.488e-28 kg.\n\nThen momentum p = γ m v = γ m β c. Given γ ≈ 12.21, β ≈ 0.9966, m ≈ 2.488e-28 kg, c ≈ 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo p = 12.21 * 0.9966 * 2.488e-28 kg * 3e8 m/s\n\nFirst compute the constants:\n\n12.21 * 0.9966 ≈ 12.168\n\n2.488e-28 kg * 3e8 m/s = 7.464e-20 kg·m/s\n\nThen p = 12.168 * 7.464e-20 ≈ 12 * 7.464e-20 = 8.9568e-19, plus 0.168 * 7.464e-20 ≈ 1.254e-20. Total ≈ 8.9568e-19 + 1.254e-20 ≈ 9.082e-19 kg·m/s. Which matches the previous calculation. So approximately 9.08e-19 kg·m/s. But again, in particle physics, using MeV/c is more common.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect the answer in units of MeV/c and MeV, which we have as approximately 1700 MeV/c and 1565 MeV.\n\nBut let me check if there's a more precise way to calculate this without approximations. Maybe solving the equations more accurately.\n\nLet me re-express the key equation:\n\nN/N0 = e^(-t/(γτ)) = 0.9\n\nt = L / v = L / (β c)\n\nSo:\n\n- L / (β c γ τ) = ln(0.9)\n\n=> L / (β c γ τ) = -ln(0.9) ≈ 0.10536\n\nBut γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), so:\n\nL / (β c τ) * sqrt(1 - β²) = 0.10536\n\nLet me define x = β. Then:\n\nL / (x c τ) * sqrt(1 - x²) = 0.10536\n\nPlugging in L = 10 m, c = 3e8 m/s, τ = 2.6e-8 s:\n\n10 / (x * 3e8 * 2.6e-8) * sqrt(1 - x²) = 0.10536\n\nCompute denominator: 3e8 * 2.6e-8 = 3 * 2.6 = 7.8\n\nSo:\n\n10 / (7.8 x) * sqrt(1 - x²) = 0.10536\n\nMultiply both sides by 7.8 x:\n\n10 * sqrt(1 - x²) = 0.10536 * 7.8 x\n\nCompute 0.10536 * 7.8 ≈ 0.8218\n\nSo:\n\n10 sqrt(1 - x²) = 0.8218 x\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\nsqrt(1 - x²) = 0.08218 x\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n1 - x² = (0.08218)^2 x² ≈ 0.006754 x²\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n1 = x² + 0.006754 x² = x² (1 + 0.006754) ≈ 1.006754 x²\n\nThus:\n\nx² = 1 / 1.006754 ≈ 0.9933\n\nx ≈ sqrt(0.9933) ≈ 0.9966, which matches previous result.\n\nThus, β ≈ 0.9966, γ ≈ 12.21, so the earlier calculations hold.\n\nTherefore, the momentum is approximately 1700 MeV/c and kinetic energy approximately 1565 MeV.\n\nBut let me check with exact numbers without rounding during steps.\n\nLet me recompute the momentum with more precise values.\n\nGiven:\n\nγ = 12.21 (exact?), β = 0.9966\n\nBut let's use more precise β. From x² = 1 / 1.006754 ≈ 0.993288\n\nThus, β = sqrt(0.993288) ≈ 0.9966385\n\nThen γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.993288) = 1 / sqrt(0.006712) ≈ 1 / 0.08193 ≈ 12.21\n\nSo γ ≈ 12.21\n\nThen, p = γ β m c\n\nm c for pion is 139.57 MeV/c² * c = 139.57 MeV/c\n\nSo p = 12.21 * 0.9966385 * 139.57 MeV/c\n\nCompute 12.21 * 0.9966385:\n\n12.21 * 0.9966385 ≈ 12.21 * 1 - 12.21 * 0.0033615 ≈ 12.21 - 0.04105 ≈ 12.16895\n\nThen 12.16895 * 139.57:\n\n12 * 139.57 = 1674.84\n\n0.16895 * 139.57 ≈ 0.1 * 139.57 = 13.957; 0.06 * 139.57 = 8.3742; 0.00895 * 139.57 ≈ 1.250\n\nTotal ≈ 13.957 + 8.3742 + 1.250 ≈ 23.5812\n\nThus, total p ≈ 1674.84 + 23.5812 ≈ 1698.42 MeV/c ≈ 1698 MeV/c\n\nSimilarly, KE = (γ - 1) m c² = (12.21 - 1) * 139.57 ≈ 11.21 * 139.57 ≈ 1564.58 MeV ≈ 1565 MeV\n\nSo rounding to appropriate significant figures, given the data has two significant figures (mean lifetime 2.6e-8, distance 10 meters, 10% decay), the answers should be presented with two significant figures. Wait, the given values: mean lifetime is 2.6e-8 sec (two sig figs), distance 10 meters (two sig figs), 10% decay (one or two sig figs? 10% could be one or two). But in physics problems, unless specified, 10% is usually considered one sig fig. However, the mean lifetime is two sig figs, distance is two. So perhaps the answers should be two sig figs.\n\nBut in our calculation, we used ln(0.9) ≈ -0.10536, which is more precise. But given the inputs, the final answers should have two sig figs.\n\nSo momentum ≈ 1.7e3 MeV/c → 1.7 GeV/c\n\nKinetic energy ≈ 1.6e3 MeV → 1.6 GeV\n\nBut wait, 1698 MeV/c is 1.698 GeV/c, which rounds to 1.7 GeV/c (two sig figs). Similarly, 1565 MeV is 1.565 GeV, which rounds to 1.6 GeV (two sig figs).\n\nAlternatively, if three sig figs are acceptable, since the given lifetime is 2.6 (two), distance 10 (two), but 10% decay could be two (10.%), then maybe two sig figs. So the answers would be:\n\nMomentum: 1.7 × 10³ MeV/c or 1.7 GeV/c\n\nKinetic energy: 1.6 × 10³ MeV or 1.6 GeV\n\nBut let me check if the exact calculation with more precise numbers changes this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of exact values without approximating ln(0.9). Let's use exact value.\n\nln(0.9) ≈ -0.105360516 (exact to more decimals)\n\nSo redo the initial equation:\n\nL / (β c) = γ τ (-ln(0.9))\n\nWith L = 10 m, τ = 2.6e-8 s, c = 3e8 m/s, ln(0.9) ≈ -0.105360516\n\nSo:\n\n10 / (β * 3e8) = γ * 2.6e-8 * 0.105360516\n\nCompute RHS: γ * 2.6e-8 * 0.105360516 ≈ γ * 2.73977e-9\n\nLHS: 10 / (β * 3e8) ≈ 3.33333e-8 / β\n\nThus:\n\n3.33333e-8 / β = γ * 2.73977e-9\n\nDivide both sides by 2.73977e-9:\n\n(3.33333e-8 / 2.73977e-9) / β ≈ 12.166 / β = γ\n\nBut γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²)\n\nSo:\n\n12.166 / β = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(12.166)^2 / β² = 1 / (1 - β²)\n\n12.166^2 = 147.94\n\nSo:\n\n147.94 / β² = 1 / (1 - β²)\n\n147.94 (1 - β²) = β²\n\n147.94 - 147.94 β² = β²\n\n147.94 = β² (1 + 147.94) = β² * 148.94\n\nβ² = 147.94 / 148.94 ≈ 0.99328\n\nβ ≈ sqrt(0.99328) ≈ 0.99663\n\nThen γ = 12.166 / β ≈ 12.166 / 0.99663 ≈ 12.21\n\nSo same result. Therefore, the momentum and KE are as calculated.\n\nThus, the answers are approximately:\n\nMomentum: 1.7 × 10³ MeV/c (1.7 GeV/c)\n\nKinetic Energy: 1.6 × 10³ MeV (1.6 GeV)\n\nBut let me check with the exact numbers once more.\n\nAlternatively, using β = 0.99663, γ = 12.21.\n\np = γ β m c = 12.21 * 0.99663 * 139.57 MeV/c\n\n12.21 * 0.99663 = 12.21 * 0.99663 ≈ 12.21 - 12.21*0.00337 ≈ 12.21 - 0.0411 ≈ 12.1689\n\n12.1689 * 139.57 ≈ 12 * 139.57 = 1674.84, 0.1689 * 139.57 ≈ 23.58, total ≈ 1698.42 MeV/c\n\nSo 1698.42 MeV/c ≈ 1.698 GeV/c ≈ 1.70 GeV/c (three sig figs)\n\nSimilarly, KE = (12.21 - 1) * 139.57 ≈ 11.21 * 139.57 ≈ 1564.58 MeV ≈ 1.565 GeV ≈ 1.56 GeV (three sig figs)\n\nBut given the problem's data has two sig figs (2.6e-8, 10 meters, 10% is one or two), it's safer to present two sig figs.\n\nThus, momentum: 1.7 GeV/c\n\nKinetic energy: 1.6 GeV\n\nBut let me check if the exact calculation with more precise γ gives a slightly different result.\n\nAlternatively, using γ = 12.21, β = 0.99663.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the answer in units of MeV/c and MeV without converting to GeV. So 1700 MeV/c and 1600 MeV.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might want the answer in scientific notation with two significant figures.\n\nSo, final answers:\n\nMomentum: 1.7 × 10³ MeV/c → \\boxed{1.7 \\ \\text{GeV}/c}\n\nKinetic Energy: 1.6 × 10³ MeV → \\boxed{1.6 \\ \\text{GeV}}\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Find the momentum and kinetic energy\", so both answers need to be boxed. However, the user's example shows a single boxed answer. But the question asks for two quantities. Maybe present both in separate boxes.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction: \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\" at the end. So perhaps list both answers in one box, separated by commas.\n\nAlternatively, check if the calculation is correct. Let me verify with an alternative approach.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe proper lifetime is τ = 2.6e-8 s. The lab frame lifetime is t = γτ.\n\nThe distance traveled is L = v t = v γ τ.\n\nThe fraction remaining is N/N0 = e^{-t/γτ} = e^{-L/(v γ τ)} = e^{-L/(β c γ τ)}. Wait, but t = L / v, and t = γ τ (-ln(0.9)), so L / v = γ τ (-ln(0.9)), which is the same equation as before. So the approach is correct.\n\nAnother way: The pions must live long enough to travel 10 meters, but due to time dilation, their lifetime is extended. The number decaying is 10%, so 90% survive. The survival probability is e^{-t/τ'}, where τ' is the mean lifetime in the lab frame, which is γτ. So t = L / v.\n\nThus, 0.9 = e^{- (L / v) / (γ", "final_answers": ["1.7 \\ \\text{GeV}/c", "1.6 \\ \\text{GeV}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "1.7 \\ \\text{GeV}/c", "expr2": "p = 1.71 \\text{ GeV/c}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "1.7 \\ \\text{GeV}/c", "expr2": "T = 1.58 \\text{ GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "1.6 \\ \\text{GeV}", "expr2": "p = 1.71 \\text{ GeV/c}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "1.6 \\ \\text{GeV}", "expr2": "T = 1.58 \\text{ GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-9", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these physics problems one by one. I need to express each quantity in terms of the given constants: e (elementary charge), ħ (reduced Planck's constant), c (speed of light), k (Boltzmann constant), m_e (electron mass), m_p (proton mass), and for part (d), τ (pion lifetime). Let's start with part (a).\n\n**Part (a): Energy needed to ionize a hydrogen atom.**\n\nHmm, ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from the ground state of hydrogen. The formula for the ground state energy of hydrogen is given by the Rydberg constant times the charge squared, but let me recall the exact expression. The ground state energy E_n for hydrogen is - (m_e e^4)/(8ε₀² h²) or something like that. Wait, but since we need to express it in terms of e, ħ, c, etc., and ε₀ can be expressed in terms of these constants. Alternatively, maybe there's a more straightforward way. The Rydberg energy is (m_e e^4)/(8ε₀² h²), but since ε₀ = 1/(4π k_e), where k_e = 1/(4πε₀) = e^2/(4πε₀) in some units. Wait, maybe using Gaussian units would help here? Alternatively, using the expression in terms of ħ instead of h. Let me think.\n\nThe ionization energy (binding energy) for hydrogen is given by the Rydberg constant times hc, but the Rydberg constant R is given by R = m_e e^4/(8ε₀² h³ c). But maybe in terms of ħ (which is h/(2π)), we can rewrite this. Let's see:\n\nThe standard formula for the ground state energy is E = - (m_e e^4)/(8ε₀² h²) * (1/(4π ε₀))^2? Wait, perhaps I need to express ε₀ in terms of e, ħ, c, and m_e. Let's recall that the fine-structure constant α = e²/(4πε₀ ħ c). So 1/(4πε₀) = α ħ c / e². Wait, maybe substituting ε₀ from α.\n\nAlternatively, the binding energy E is (1/2) α² m_e c². Because the Rydberg energy is 13.6 eV, which is (1/2) α² m_e c². Let's check: α = e²/(4πε₀ ħ c) ≈ 1/137. So (1/2) (1/137)^2 * m_e c². Let's compute m_e c² in eV: m_e c² ≈ 0.511 MeV, so (0.511e6 eV) * (1/2)*(1/137)^2 ≈ approximately 13.6 eV. That works. So E = (1/2) m_e (e^2/(4πε₀ ħ))^2. Wait, but how to express this without ε₀? Since α = e²/(4πε₀ ħ c), so 4πε₀ = e²/(α ħ c). Substitute into the expression:\n\nE = (1/2) m_e ( (e^2/(4πε₀)) / ħ )^2 / (something). Wait, maybe better to express E in terms of α. Since α = e²/(4πε₀ ħ c), then 1/(4πε₀) = α ħ c / e². Wait, no: solving for 1/(4πε₀) gives α ħ c / e². Let me substitute that into the expression for E.\n\nThe binding energy is E = - (m_e e^4)/(8 ε₀² ħ²) * (1/(4πε₀))^2? Wait, maybe I need to rederive it properly.\n\nThe Coulomb potential energy is -e^2/(4πε₀ r), and the kinetic energy is (ħ²)/(2 m_e r²). For the ground state, the Bohr radius a_0 = (4πε₀ ħ²)/(m_e e²). The total energy is kinetic + potential: K + U = (ħ²/(2 m_e a_0²)) - (e²/(4πε₀ a_0)). Substitute a_0 into this:\n\nK = (ħ²/(2 m_e)) * (m_e^2 e^4)/( (4πε₀)^2 ħ^4 )) ) = (m_e e^4)/( 2 (4πε₀)^2 ħ² )\n\nSimilarly, U = - (e^2/(4πε₀)) * (m_e e^2)/(4πε₀ ħ²) ) = - (m_e e^4)/( (4πε₀)^2 ħ² )\n\nSo total energy E = K + U = (m_e e^4)/(2 (4πε₀)^2 ħ² ) - (m_e e^4)/( (4πε₀)^2 ħ² ) = - (m_e e^4)/( 2 (4πε₀)^2 ħ² )\n\nBut we need to express this in terms of e, ħ, c, etc., without ε₀. Since α = e²/(4πε₀ ħ c), so 4πε₀ = e²/(α ħ c). Therefore, (4πε₀)^2 = e^4/(α² ħ² c²). Substitute into E:\n\nE = - (m_e e^4 ) / ( 2 * (e^4/(α² ħ² c²)) * ħ² ) ) = - (m_e e^4 * α² ħ² c² ) / (2 e^4 ħ² ) ) = - (m_e α² c² ) / 2\n\nBut α is e²/(4πε₀ ħ c), which is in terms of e, ħ, c. Wait, but we need to express E without α. Let's substitute α back into the expression:\n\nE = - (m_e (e^4)/( (4πε₀)^2 ħ² c² )) * c² ) / 2\n\nWait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let's try again. Starting from E = - (m_e e^4)/(2 (4πε₀)^2 ħ² )\n\nExpress (4πε₀) in terms of e, ħ, c. From α = e²/(4πε₀ ħ c), so 4πε₀ = e²/(α ħ c). Therefore, (4πε₀)^2 = e^4/(α² ħ² c²). Substitute into E:\n\nE = - (m_e e^4 ) / ( 2 * (e^4/(α² ħ² c²)) * ħ² ) ) = - (m_e e^4 * α² ħ² c² ) / (2 e^4 ħ² ) ) = - (m_e α² c² ) / 2\n\nBut α is e²/(4πε₀ ħ c), so substituting α into E gives:\n\nE = - (m_e (e^4)/( (4πε₀)^2 ħ² c² )) * c² ) / 2\n\nWait, this seems circular. Maybe another approach. Let's use the expression for α to replace 1/(4πε₀):\n\nα = e²/(4πε₀ ħ c) → 1/(4πε₀) = α ħ c / e²\n\nThen, (1/(4πε₀))^2 = α² ħ² c² / e^4\n\nSo E = - (m_e e^4 ) / (2 * (α² ħ² c² / e^4 ) * ħ² )\n\nSimplify denominator: 2 * α² ħ² c² / e^4 * ħ² = 2 α² ħ^4 c² / e^4\n\nSo E = - (m_e e^4 * e^4 ) / (2 α² ħ^4 c² ) * 1/ħ² )\n\nWait, no. Wait, E is numerator m_e e^4 divided by denominator 2*(1/(4πε₀))^2 * ħ². But (1/(4πε₀))^2 is α² ħ² c² / e^4. So denominator is 2 * (α² ħ² c² / e^4 ) * ħ² = 2 α² ħ^4 c² / e^4\n\nTherefore, E = - (m_e e^4 ) / (2 α² ħ^4 c² / e^4 ) ) = - (m_e e^8 ) / (2 α² ħ^4 c² )\n\nBut this seems complicated. Wait, but α is e²/(4πε₀ ħ c), so α² = e^4/( (4πε₀)^2 ħ² c² )\n\nTherefore, substituting back, E = - (m_e e^4 ) / (2 * (e^4/(α² ħ² c² )) * ħ² ) )\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let's recall that the ionization energy is (m_e e^4)/(8 ε₀² h²), but h = 2πħ. So substituting h = 2πħ:\n\nE = (m_e e^4)/(8 ε₀² (2πħ)^2 ) = (m_e e^4)/(32 π² ε₀² ħ² )\n\nBut again, we need to eliminate ε₀. Using α = e²/(4πε₀ ħ c), so 4πε₀ = e²/(α ħ c). Then ε₀ = e²/(4π α ħ c). Therefore, ε₀² = e^4/(16 π² α² ħ² c² )\n\nSubstitute into E:\n\nE = (m_e e^4 ) / (32 π² * (e^4/(16 π² α² ħ² c² )) * ħ² )\n\nSimplify denominator: 32 π² * e^4/(16 π² α² ħ² c² ) * ħ² = 32 π² * e^4 * ħ² / (16 π² α² ħ² c² ) ) = (32/16) * (e^4 / α² c² ) = 2 e^4 / (α² c² )\n\nTherefore, E = m_e e^4 / (2 e^4 / (α² c² )) ) = m_e α² c² / 2\n\nBut α is e²/(4πε₀ ħ c), which is given in terms of e, ħ, c. Wait, but the problem says to express in terms of e, ħ, c, etc., so maybe we can leave it in terms of α? But the problem states \"in terms of e, ħ, c, k, m_e, and m_p\". So we can't use α unless we express it in terms of those constants. Since α = e²/(4πε₀ ħ c), but 4πε₀ is not one of the given constants. Wait, but maybe in Gaussian units, 4πε₀ is absorbed into the units, but the problem doesn't specify units. Hmm, this is a problem because ε₀ is not among the given constants. Wait, but the given constants include e, ħ, c, etc. So perhaps we need to express ε₀ in terms of e, ħ, c. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, in SI units, ε₀ has units of F/m, but in terms of the given constants, perhaps we can use the relation from Coulomb's law. Alternatively, since we have e, ħ, c, and m_e, but ε₀ is a separate constant. However, the problem might be expecting the answer in Gaussian or another unit system where ε₀ is incorporated into the units. For example, in Gaussian units, the Coulomb force is F = (e^2)/(r^2), so 4πε₀ is set to 1. But in that case, the expression for the ionization energy would be E = (m_e e^4)/(2 ħ²). Wait, let's check:\n\nIn Gaussian units, the Rydberg constant is R_H = (m_e e^4)/(2 ħ^2). So the ionization energy is E = R_H = (m_e e^4)/(2 ħ^2). But wait, but in Gaussian units, the energy would have factors of c? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn Gaussian units, the Coulomb potential is e^2/(r), so the potential energy is -e^2/r. The Bohr radius a_0 = ħ²/(m_e e^2). The ground state energy is then E = - (m_e e^4)/(2 ħ²). So the ionization energy is (m_e e^4)/(2 ħ²). But in Gaussian units, e has dimensions of (erg·cm)^(1/2), but here the problem gives e as the elementary charge. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify units, so perhaps the answer is (m_e e^4)/(2 ħ²). But wait, in SI units, the answer would have factors of 4πε₀, but since the problem allows using e, ħ, c, etc., but not ε₀, maybe we need to use the expression in Gaussian units where ε₀ is absorbed. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is (m_e e^4)/(2 (4πε₀)^2 ħ²), but since we can't use ε₀, we need to relate it through α.\n\nWait, α = e²/(4πε₀ ħ c) → 4πε₀ = e²/(α ħ c). So substituting into E:\n\nE = (m_e e^4)/(2 ( (e²/(α ħ c))^2 ) ħ² ) ) = (m_e e^4)/(2 (e^4/(α² ħ² c²)) ħ² ) ) = (m_e e^4 * α² ħ² c² )/(2 e^4 ħ² ) ) = (m_e α² c²)/2\n\nBut α is e²/(4πε₀ ħ c), which again includes ε₀. So unless we can express α in terms of the given constants without ε₀, which we can't, this seems stuck. Wait, but the problem says \"in terms of e, ħ, c, k, m_e, and m_p\". So ε₀ is not among them, so perhaps the answer must be expressed using α, but since α itself is e²/(4πε₀ ħ c), which includes ε₀, which is not given. Therefore, maybe the answer is (m_e e^4)/(2 (4πε₀)^2 ħ²), but since we can't use ε₀, this is impossible. Therefore, there must be a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps using the expression in terms of the Compton wavelength or other constants. Alternatively, maybe the answer is simply (m_e e^4)/(2 ħ²), assuming that 4πε₀ is set to 1, which would be the case in Gaussian units. But the problem doesn't specify units, so this is ambiguous. However, given that the constants provided are e, ħ, c, etc., and not ε₀, the answer must be expressed without ε₀. Therefore, the correct expression must involve e, ħ, m_e, and c, but how?\n\nWait, let's recall that the fine-structure constant α = e²/(4πε₀ ħ c), so 1/(4πε₀) = α ħ c / e². Therefore, substituting into the expression for E:\n\nE = (m_e e^4)/(2 (4πε₀)^2 ħ² ) = (m_e e^4)/(2 ( (α ħ c / e² )^2 ) ħ² ) ) = (m_e e^4 )/(2 ( α² ħ² c² / e^4 ) ħ² ) ) = (m_e e^4 * e^4 )/(2 α² ħ^4 c² ) ) = (m_e e^8 )/(2 α² ħ^4 c² )\n\nBut α is e²/(4πε₀ ħ c), which again includes ε₀. So this seems like a dead end. Wait, but maybe the problem expects the answer in Gaussian units where 4πε₀ = 1, so then E = (m_e e^4)/(2 ħ²). But in Gaussian units, e has different dimensions. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is (1/2) m_e c² α². Since α = e²/(4πε₀ ħ c), then α² = e^4/( (4πε₀)^2 ħ² c² ), so substituting back:\n\nE = (1/2) m_e c² * (e^4/( (4πε₀)^2 ħ² c² )) ) = (m_e e^4 )/( 2 (4πε₀)^2 ħ² c² ) * c² ) = (m_e e^4 )/( 2 (4πε₀)^2 ħ² )\n\nWhich matches the earlier expression. But again, we can't express this without ε₀. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my approach. Let me check standard formulas.\n\nWait, the Rydberg constant R is given by R = m_e e^4/(8 ε₀² h³ c), but h = 2πħ. So substituting h = 2πħ:\n\nR = m_e e^4/(8 ε₀² (2πħ)^3 c ) = m_e e^4/(8 * 8 π³ ε₀² ħ³ c ) ) = m_e e^4/(64 π³ ε₀² ħ³ c )\n\nBut the ionization energy is R h c = (m_e e^4/(64 π³ ε₀² ħ³ c )) * h c. Since h = 2πħ, this becomes:\n\nR h c = (m_e e^4/(64 π³ ε₀² ħ³ c )) * 2πħ * c = (m_e e^4 * 2πħ c )/(64 π³ ε₀² ħ³ c ) ) = (m_e e^4 )/(32 π² ε₀² ħ² )\n\nWhich is the same as before. Again, stuck with ε₀. Therefore, the conclusion is that without ε₀, we can't express the ionization energy in terms of the given constants. But the problem says to use e, ħ, c, etc. So perhaps the answer is expected to be written in terms of α, but since α is e²/(4πε₀ ħ c), which includes ε₀, which is not given, this is impossible. Therefore, there must be a different approach. Wait, maybe using the expression for the Bohr magneton or other constants. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that 4πε₀ is absorbed into the units, so the answer is (m_e e^4)/(2 ħ²). But I need to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the relation c = 1/(sqrt(ε₀ μ₀)), but μ₀ is also not given. This seems not helpful. Alternatively, using the fact that the speed of light c = 1/sqrt(ε₀ μ₀), but without μ₀, we can't eliminate ε₀. Therefore, this approach also fails.\n\nWait, but the problem gives c as one of the constants. So maybe we can express ε₀ in terms of c and other constants? For example, in SI units, the impedance of free space Z₀ = sqrt(μ₀/ε₀) = μ₀ c. But without μ₀, we can't proceed. Alternatively, since c^2 = 1/(ε₀ μ₀), so ε₀ μ₀ = 1/c². But again, without μ₀, we can't solve for ε₀. Therefore, it's impossible to express ε₀ solely in terms of c. Therefore, the problem must be assuming a unit system where 4πε₀ = 1, such as Gaussian units, allowing the expression without ε₀. In that case, the ionization energy is (m_e e^4)/(2 ħ²). But in Gaussian units, e has units of (erg·cm)^(1/2), but the problem doesn't specify units. However, given that the answer must be in terms of the given constants, and since ε₀ is not given, the answer must be (m_e e^4)/(2 ħ²). Therefore, I think that's the answer expected here.\n\n**Part (a) Answer:**\nThe ionization energy is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{m_e e^4}{2 \\hbar^2}}\\).\n\n**Part (b): Difference in frequency of the Lyman alpha line in hydrogen and deuterium atoms.**\n\nThe Lyman alpha line corresponds to the transition from n=2 to n=1. The frequency of the spectral line depends on the Rydberg constant, which is proportional to the reduced mass of the electron and nucleus. For hydrogen, the nucleus is a proton (mass m_p), and for deuterium, it's a deuteron (mass ≈ 2m_p). The difference in frequency arises because the reduced mass is different.\n\nThe Rydberg constant for a nucleus of mass M is R_M = R_∞ * (1/(1 + m_e/M)), where R_∞ is the Rydberg constant for an infinite mass nucleus. The frequency of the Lyman alpha line is proportional to R_M (since the transition is 1-1/4 = 3/4 times Rydberg constant). So the frequency ν_H for hydrogen is (3/4) R_H c, and ν_D for deuterium is (3/4) R_D c. The difference Δν = ν_D - ν_H = (3/4) c (R_D - R_H).\n\nExpressing R_H and R_D:\n\nR_H = R_∞ * (1/(1 + m_e/m_p))  \nR_D = R_∞ * (1/(1 + m_e/(2m_p)))  \n\nThus, R_D - R_H = R_∞ [1/(1 + m_e/(2m_p)) - 1/(1 + m_e/m_p)]  \n= R_∞ [ (1 + m_e/m_p - 1 - m_e/(2m_p)) / ( (1 + m_e/(2m_p))(1 + m_e/m_p) ) ) ]  \n= R_∞ [ (m_e/m_p - m_e/(2m_p)) / (denominator) ) ]  \n= R_∞ [ (m_e/(2m_p)) / ( (1 + m_e/(2m_p))(1 + m_e/m_p) ) ) ]\n\nAssuming m_e << m_p, the denominator ≈ 1*1 = 1. So approximately:\n\nR_D - R_H ≈ R_∞ (m_e/(2m_p)) )\n\nBut R_∞ = (m_e e^4)/(8 ε₀² h³ c) as before. However, again, we need to express this in terms of given constants. Alternatively, using the expression for R_∞ in terms of other constants. But similar to part (a), we might need to use the Rydberg constant expression. However, since we are to express the difference in frequency, let's proceed.\n\nThe frequency difference Δν ≈ (3/4) c * R_∞ (m_e/(2m_p)) )\n\nBut R_∞ is the Rydberg constant for infinite mass, which is R_∞ = (m_e e^4)/(8 ε₀² h³ c). Substituting this into Δν:\n\nΔν ≈ (3/4) c * (m_e e^4)/(8 ε₀² h³ c) * (m_e/(2m_p)) )  \n= (3/4) * (m_e e^4)/(8 ε₀² h³ ) * (m_e/(2m_p)) )  \n= (3 m_e² e^4 )/(64 ε₀² h³ m_p )\n\nBut again, we need to eliminate ε₀. Using α = e²/(4πε₀ ħ c), so 1/ε₀ = 4π α ħ c / e². Therefore, 1/ε₀² = 16 π² α² ħ² c² / e^4. Substitute into Δν:\n\nΔν = (3 m_e² e^4 )/(64 * (16 π² α² ħ² c² / e^4 ) * h³ m_p )  \n= (3 m_e² e^8 )/(64 * 16 π² α² ħ² c² h³ m_p )\n\nBut h = 2πħ, so h³ = (2πħ)^3 = 8 π³ ħ³. Substitute:\n\nΔν = (3 m_e² e^8 )/(64 * 16 π² α² ħ² c² * 8 π³ ħ³ m_p )  \n= (3 m_e² e^8 )/(64 * 16 * 8 * π² * π³ * α² ħ^5 c² m_p )  \n= (3 m_e² e^8 )/(64 * 128 * π^5 α² ħ^5 c² m_p )\n\nThis seems too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way using the expression in terms of the Rydberg frequency. Alternatively, using the approximation that the reduced mass μ ≈ m_e (1 - m_e/M), so the Rydberg constant R_M ≈ R_∞ (1 - m_e/M). Then the difference R_D - R_H ≈ R_∞ (m_e/m_p - m_e/(2m_p)) = R_∞ m_e/(2m_p). Then Δν ≈ (3/4) c R_∞ m_e/(2m_p). But R_∞ is (m_e e^4)/(8 ε₀² h³ c). Substituting:\n\nΔν ≈ (3/4) c * (m_e e^4)/(8 ε₀² h³ c) * m_e/(2m_p) )  \n= (3 m_e² e^4 )/(64 ε₀² h³ m_p )\n\nAgain, stuck with ε₀. But using α = e²/(4πε₀ ħ c), so ε₀ = e²/(4π α ħ c). Therefore, ε₀² = e^4/(16 π² α² ħ² c² ). Substitute:\n\nΔν = (3 m_e² e^4 )/(64 * (e^4/(16 π² α² ħ² c² )) * h³ m_p )  \n= (3 m_e² e^4 * 16 π² α² ħ² c² )/(64 e^4 h³ m_p )  \n= (3 m_e² * 16 π² α² ħ² c² )/(64 h³ m_p )\n\nSimplify coefficients: 16/64 = 1/4, so:\n\nΔν = (3 m_e² π² α² ħ² c² )/(4 h³ m_p )\n\nBut h = 2πħ, so h³ = 8 π³ ħ³. Substitute:\n\nΔν = (3 m_e² π² α² ħ² c² )/(4 * 8 π³ ħ³ m_p )  \n= (3 m_e² α² c² )/(32 π ħ m_p )\n\nBut α = e²/(4πε₀ ħ c), which again includes ε₀. So unless we can express α in terms of e, ħ, c, which we can't without ε₀, this is not possible. Therefore, perhaps the answer is expressed in terms of α, but since the problem doesn't list α as a given constant, we need to express α in terms of e, ħ, c. Since α = e²/(4πε₀ ħ c), but ε₀ is not given, this is impossible. Therefore, the problem must assume a unit system where 4πε₀ = 1, leading to α = e²/(ħ c). Then α² = e^4/(ħ² c²). Substitute into Δν:\n\nΔν = (3 m_e² (e^4/(ħ² c²)) c² )/(32 π ħ m_p )  \n= (3 m_e² e^4 )/(32 π ħ^3 m_p )\n\nBut π is not one of the given constants. Wait, the given constants include k, which is Boltzmann's constant, but not π. However, the problem says \"in terms of e, ħ, c, k, m_e, and m_p\". So π is not allowed. Therefore, this approach is invalid. Therefore, there must be a different way.\n\nAlternatively, using the expression for the Rydberg constant R_H = (m_e e^4)/(8 ε₀² h³ c) * (1/(1 + m_e/m_p)). The difference in Rydberg constants between deuterium and hydrogen is R_D - R_H = R_∞ (1/(1 + m_e/(2m_p)) - 1/(1 + m_e/m_p)). Expanding this for small m_e/m_p:\n\n1/(1 + x) ≈ 1 - x + x² - ...  \nSo 1/(1 + m_e/(2m_p)) ≈ 1 - m_e/(2m_p)  \n1/(1 + m_e/m_p) ≈ 1 - m_e/m_p  \nThus, difference ≈ [1 - m_e/(2m_p)] - [1 - m_e/m_p] = m_e/m_p - m_e/(2m_p) = m_e/(2m_p)  \nTherefore, R_D - R_H ≈ R_∞ * m_e/(2m_p)  \n\nThen the frequency difference Δν = (3/4) c (R_D - R_H) ≈ (3/4) c R_∞ m_e/(2m_p)  \n\nBut R_∞ = (m_e e^4)/(8 ε₀² h³ c). Substituting:\n\nΔν ≈ (3/4) c * (m_e e^4)/(8 ε₀² h³ c) * m_e/(2m_p) )  \n= (3 m_e² e^4 )/(64 ε₀² h³ m_p )\n\nAgain, same expression. To eliminate ε₀, use α = e²/(4πε₀ ħ c) → ε₀ = e²/(4π α ħ c). Substitute into Δν:\n\nΔν = (3 m_e² e^4 )/(64 (e^4/(16 π² α² ħ² c² )) h³ m_p )  \n= (3 m_e² e^4 * 16 π² α² ħ² c² )/(64 e^4 h³ m_p )  \n= (3 m_e² π² α² ħ² c² )/(4 h³ m_p )\n\nBut h = 2πħ, so h³ = 8 π³ ħ³:\n\nΔν = (3 m_e² π² α² ħ² c² )/(4 * 8 π³ ħ³ m_p )  \n= (3 m_e² α² c² )/(32 π ħ m_p )\n\nAgain, stuck with α and π. Since the problem allows using e, ħ, c, etc., but not α or π, this suggests that the answer should be expressed in terms of e, ħ, c, m_e, m_p, and numerical factors. However, the presence of π suggests that perhaps the approximation is being made where m_e/m_p is very small, so higher-order terms are neglected. But even then, the leading term would still involve these constants.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is expressed as (3/4) c (R_D - R_H), and R_D - R_H is expressed in terms of the given constants. Let's try to write R_∞ in terms of e, ħ, c, m_e. From part (a), the ionization energy is E = (m_e e^4)/(2 ħ²) (assuming Gaussian units), so R_∞ = E/(h c) = (m_e e^4)/(2 ħ² h c). But h = 2πħ, so:\n\nR_∞ = (m_e e^4)/(2 ħ² * 2πħ c ) = (m_e e^4)/(4π ħ³ c )\n\nThen R_D - R_H ≈ R_∞ m_e/(2m_p) = (m_e e^4)/(4π ħ³ c ) * m_e/(2m_p) ) = (m_e² e^4)/(8π ħ³ c m_p )\n\nTherefore, Δν = (3/4) c * (m_e² e^4)/(8π ħ³ c m_p ) ) = (3 m_e² e^4 )/(32 π ħ³ m_p )\n\nBut π is not allowed. However, the problem might accept answers with π as it's a numerical factor. The given constants include k, which is Boltzmann's constant, but π is a mathematical constant, not a physical one. The problem says \"in terms of e, ħ, c, k, m_e, and m_p\". Since π is a numerical factor, it's allowed. So the answer is (3 m_e² e^4 )/(32 π ħ³ m_p )\n\nBut wait, let's check the derivation again. If in Gaussian units, the Rydberg constant R_∞ = m_e e^4/(2 ħ^3 c), then R_∞ = m_e e^4/(2 ħ^3 c). Then R_D - R_H ≈ R_∞ m_e/(2m_p) = (m_e e^4/(2 ħ^3 c)) * (m_e/(2m_p)) = m_e² e^4/(4 ħ^3 c m_p )\n\nThen Δν = (3/4) c * (m_e² e^4)/(4 ħ^3 c m_p ) ) = (3 m_e² e^4 )/(16 ħ^3 m_p )\n\nBut this doesn't have π. Wait, this discrepancy arises because in Gaussian units, the expression for Rydberg's constant is different. Let me confirm:\n\nIn Gaussian units, the energy levels are E_n = - (m_e e^4)/(2 ħ² n²). The Rydberg constant R_∞ is then E_1/(h c) = (m_e e^4)/(2 ħ²) / (h c). Since h = 2πħ, this becomes:\n\nR_∞ = (m_e e^4)/(2 ħ² * 2πħ c ) = (m_e e^4)/(4π ħ³ c )\n\nSo R_∞ = m_e e^4/(4π ħ³ c )\n\nThen R_D - R_H ≈ R_∞ m_e/(2m_p) = (m_e e^4)/(4π ħ³ c ) * m_e/(2m_p) ) = m_e² e^4/(8π ħ³ c m_p )\n\nThen Δν = (3/4) c * (m_e² e^4)/(8π ħ³ c m_p ) ) = (3 m_e² e^4 )/(32 π ħ³ m_p )\n\nSo the answer includes π. However, the problem allows using the given constants, which don't include π, but π is a mathematical constant, so it's acceptable. Therefore, the difference in frequency is (3 m_e² e^4)/(32 π ħ³ m_p )\n\nBut let's check the units to ensure it's a frequency. The units of e²/(ħ c) is dimensionless (since α is dimensionless). Then e^4/(ħ^3 c) has units of (C^4)/(J^3 s^3 * m/s) → but this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, in terms of dimensions:\n\n[m_e] = kg  \n[e] = C  \n[ħ] = J·s  \n[c] = m/s  \n[m_p] = kg  \n\nSo m_e² e^4/(ħ^3 m_p ) has units:\n\nkg²·C^4/( (J·s)^3 · kg ) ) = kg·C^4/( J^3 s^3 )\n\nBut J = kg·m²/s², so J^3 = kg^3·m^6/s^6. Therefore:\n\nkg·C^4/( kg^3·m^6/s^6 s^3 ) ) = C^4 s^3/( kg^2 m^6 s^3 ) ) = C^4/( kg^2 m^6 )\n\nNot sure if this simplifies to 1/s. Maybe there's a mistake. Alternatively, using the fact that e²/(4πε₀) has units of N·m², but this is getting too complicated. Perhaps the answer is correct as derived.\n\n**Part (b) Answer:**\nThe frequency difference is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac", "final_answers": ["\\dfrac{m_e e^4}{2 \\hbar^2}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\dfrac{m_e e^4}{2 \\hbar^2}", "expr2": "E_I = \\left( \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0} \\right)^2 \\frac{m_e}{2\\hbar^2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "e**4*m/(2*hbar**2)", "expr2": "e**4*m/(32*hbar**2*pi**2*varepsilon**2)"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\dfrac{m_e e^4}{2 \\hbar^2}", "expr2": "\\Delta \\nu = \\frac{3}{4} \\left( \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\right)^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 m_e^2}{h^3 m_p}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "e**4*m/(2*hbar**2)", "expr2": "3*e**4*m/(64*h**3*varepsilon**2)"}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\dfrac{m_e e^4}{2 \\hbar^2}", "expr2": "\\mu_e = \\frac{he}{4\\pi m_e}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "e**4*m/(2*hbar**2)", "expr2": "e*h/(4*m*pi)"}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\dfrac{m_e e^4}{2 \\hbar^2}", "expr2": "\\Delta E \\gtrsim \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "e**4*m/(2*hbar**2)", "expr2": "Delta*E*gtrsim*hbar/tau"}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\dfrac{m_e e^4}{2 \\hbar^2}", "expr2": "B = \\frac{kT}{\\mu_p} \\times 10^{-4}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "e**4*m/(2*hbar**2)", "expr2": "T*k/(10000*mu)"}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\dfrac{m_e e^4}{2 \\hbar^2}", "expr2": "\\Delta E = \\frac{\\pi Rhc\\alpha^2}{8}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "e**4*m/(2*hbar**2)", "expr2": "R*alpha**2*c*h*pi/8"}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/4-22", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to calculate the fractional change in the kinetic energy of an alpha particle when it's scattered through 180 degrees by an oxygen-16 nucleus. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about scattering in physics. I think this is related to Rutherford scattering or maybe elastic collisions? Since it's an alpha particle (which is a helium nucleus, so charge +2e) and an oxygen-16 nucleus (charge +8e, since oxygen has atomic number 8), they're both positively charged, so the scattering would be due to Coulomb repulsion. \n\nWait, the problem mentions the fractional change in kinetic energy. Fractional change would be (K_final - K_initial)/K_initial, but since it's scattered through 180 degrees, maybe the kinetic energy changes after the collision? But wait, in Rutherford scattering, the target nucleus is usually considered to be much heavier and stationary, so maybe the alpha particle's kinetic energy doesn't change much? Or does it? Wait, no, in an elastic collision, even if the target is much heavier, there's a transfer of kinetic energy. Wait, but in Rutherford scattering, the assumption is that the target's mass is so large that its recoil is negligible, so the kinetic energy of the alpha particle remains approximately the same. But here, the oxygen-16 nucleus has a mass of 16 atomic mass units, and the alpha particle is 4 atomic mass units. So oxygen is 4 times heavier. That's not extremely heavy, so maybe the recoil can't be neglected. Therefore, the collision would be elastic, and we need to apply conservation of momentum and energy to find the kinetic energy after collision.\n\nWait, the problem says \"scattered through 180 degrees,\" which would imply a head-on collision, right? Because maximum scattering angle occurs in a head-on collision. So in that case, the alpha particle approaches the oxygen nucleus head-on, comes to a momentary stop (if it were a perfectly elastic collision with equal masses, but here the masses are different), and then recoils back. But since oxygen is heavier, the alpha particle would rebound with some velocity, but the oxygen nucleus would also gain some velocity. So we need to calculate the final kinetic energy of the alpha particle and compare it to the initial.\n\nSo let's model this as an elastic collision in one dimension (since it's a head-on collision). Let me denote:\n\n- Mass of alpha particle: m = 4 u (where u is atomic mass unit)\n- Mass of oxygen nucleus: M = 16 u\n- Initial velocity of alpha particle: v_initial\n- Initial velocity of oxygen nucleus: 0 (assuming it's initially stationary)\n- Final velocity of alpha particle: v_final\n- Final velocity of oxygen nucleus: V_final\n\nSince the collision is elastic, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved.\n\nConservation of momentum:\n\nm * v_initial = m * v_final + M * V_final\n\nConservation of kinetic energy:\n\n(1/2) m v_initial^2 = (1/2) m v_final^2 + (1/2) M V_final^2\n\nWe need to solve these equations for v_final and V_final, then compute the fractional change in kinetic energy of the alpha particle, which would be (K_final - K_initial)/K_initial = ( (1/2 m v_final^2 ) - (1/2 m v_initial^2 ) ) / (1/2 m v_initial^2 ) = (v_final^2 / v_initial^2 ) - 1\n\nSo first, let's solve the system of equations.\n\nFrom momentum conservation:\n\nm v_initial = m v_final + M V_final\n\nLet me divide both sides by m:\n\nv_initial = v_final + (M/m) V_final\n\nSince M = 16 u and m = 4 u, M/m = 4. So:\n\nv_initial = v_final + 4 V_final  --> equation (1)\n\nFrom kinetic energy conservation:\n\n(1/2) m v_initial^2 = (1/2) m v_final^2 + (1/2) M V_final^2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nm v_initial^2 = m v_final^2 + M V_final^2\n\nAgain, substituting M = 4m:\n\nm v_initial^2 = m v_final^2 + 4m V_final^2\n\nDivide both sides by m:\n\nv_initial^2 = v_final^2 + 4 V_final^2  --> equation (2)\n\nNow, from equation (1), we can express v_initial in terms of v_final and V_final. Let's solve equation (1) for v_final:\n\nv_final = v_initial - 4 V_final\n\nSubstitute this into equation (2):\n\nv_initial^2 = (v_initial - 4 V_final)^2 + 4 V_final^2\n\nExpand the square:\n\nv_initial^2 = v_initial^2 - 8 v_initial V_final + 16 V_final^2 + 4 V_final^2\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\nv_initial^2 = v_initial^2 - 8 v_initial V_final + 20 V_final^2\n\nSubtract v_initial^2 from both sides:\n\n0 = -8 v_initial V_final + 20 V_final^2\n\nFactor out V_final:\n\n0 = V_final (-8 v_initial + 20 V_final )\n\nSo, either V_final = 0 (which would mean no collision, so we discard this) or:\n\n-8 v_initial + 20 V_final = 0\n\nSolving for V_final:\n\n20 V_final = 8 v_initial\n\nV_final = (8 / 20) v_initial = (2/5) v_initial\n\nNow, substitute back into equation (1) to find v_final:\n\nv_initial = v_final + 4*(2/5 v_initial)\n\nv_initial = v_final + (8/5) v_initial\n\nSubtract (8/5) v_initial from both sides:\n\nv_initial - (8/5) v_initial = v_final\n\n(5/5 - 8/5) v_initial = v_final\n\n(-3/5) v_initial = v_final\n\nSo, v_final = - (3/5) v_initial\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the alpha particle reverses direction, which makes sense for a 180-degree scattering.\n\nNow, compute the final kinetic energy of the alpha particle:\n\nK_final = (1/2) m v_final^2 = (1/2) m ( (-3/5 v_initial )^2 ) = (1/2) m (9/25 v_initial^2 ) = (9/25) * (1/2 m v_initial^2 ) = (9/25) K_initial\n\nTherefore, the fractional change in kinetic energy is:\n\n(K_final - K_initial)/K_initial = ( (9/25 K_initial ) - K_initial ) / K_initial = ( (9/25 - 1 ) ) = (-16/25 )\n\nSo the fractional change is -16/25, which is a decrease of 16/25, or the kinetic energy is reduced by 16/25 of its initial value.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the fractional change. Since the kinetic energy decreases, the fractional change is negative. However, sometimes fractional change is asked as the absolute value, but the problem doesn't specify. Let me check the problem statement again: \"Calculate the fractional change in the kinetic energy of an α-particle when it is scattered through 180° by an O¹⁶ nucleus.\"\n\nSo fractional change is (K_final - K_initial)/K_initial. Since K_final is 9/25 K_initial, then the change is (9/25 - 1) = -16/25. So the fractional change is -16/25, which is -0.64. But maybe the problem expects the magnitude? Let me think. In physics, fractional change can be signed, indicating a decrease. So the answer should be -16/25. But let me check if I made any mistake here.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is using the formula for the kinetic energy transfer in elastic collisions. The maximum kinetic energy transferred occurs in a head-on collision. The formula for the fraction of kinetic energy transferred is (4 m M)/( (m + M)^2 ). Wait, but that's when the target is initially at rest. Let me recall.\n\nIn a head-on elastic collision with a stationary target of mass M, the fraction of kinetic energy transferred is (4 m M)/(m + M)^2. Wait, but that's the maximum possible energy transfer. Wait, but in this case, since the alpha particle is scattered back, the kinetic energy it retains would be [(M - m)/(M + m)]^2 times the initial kinetic energy. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the final velocity of the alpha particle in a head-on elastic collision can be calculated using the formula:\n\nv1' = [(m1 - m2)/(m1 + m2)] v1 + [2 m2/(m1 + m2)] v2\n\nBut since the target (m2) is initially at rest, v2 = 0, so:\n\nv1' = (m1 - m2)/(m1 + m2) * v1\n\nIn our case, m1 is the alpha particle (4 u), m2 is the oxygen nucleus (16 u). So:\n\nv1' = (4 - 16)/(4 + 16) * v1 = (-12/20) v1 = (-3/5) v1, which matches what we found earlier. Then the kinetic energy is (v1')² / v1² times the initial KE, which is (9/25) K_initial. So the fractional change is (9/25 - 1) = -16/25. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the fractional change is -16/25, which is a loss of 64% of the initial kinetic energy. So the answer should be -16/25, but since the question asks for the fractional change, it's negative. However, sometimes fractional changes are expressed as absolute values, but unless specified, the sign matters. Let me check standard problems. For example, in elastic collisions, when a lighter particle hits a heavier one, it bounces back with reduced speed, so KE decreases. The fractional change is negative. So the answer is -16/25. But let me check the problem statement again. It says \"fractional change in the kinetic energy\". So yes, it's (K_final - K_initial)/K_initial = (9/25 - 1) = -16/25. So the answer is -16/25. But the problem might expect the magnitude, but unless stated, the sign is important. However, in some contexts, fractional change is given as a positive value if it's a loss. Wait, but in physics, fractional change is signed. For example, if something decreases by half, the fractional change is -0.5. So I think the answer is -16/25. Let me confirm once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the change as |ΔK| / K_initial, but the wording is \"fractional change\", which typically includes the sign. So I think the answer is -16/25. But let me check the calculation once again.\n\nYes, the steps are correct. The velocity of the alpha particle after collision is -3/5 v_initial, so the kinetic energy is (9/25) of the initial, so the change is 9/25 - 1 = -16/25. Therefore, the fractional change is -16/25. So the answer should be \\boxed{-\\dfrac{16}{25}}.\n\nBut wait, sometimes in scattering problems, especially when dealing with Coulomb scattering, the energy loss might be calculated differently. Wait, but in Rutherford scattering, the target is assumed to be stationary and infinitely massive, so KE doesn't change. But here, since the oxygen nucleus is not infinitely massive (only 4 times heavier), we have to consider the recoil, hence the energy loss. So the approach using elastic collision is correct here. Therefore, the answer is -16/25.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate the fractional change in the kinetic energy of an α-particle scattered through 180° by an O¹⁶ nucleus, we model the collision as a head-on elastic collision. \n\n**Given:**\n- Mass of α-particle, \\( m = 4 \\, \\text{u} \\)\n- Mass of O¹⁶ nucleus, \\( M = 16 \\, \\text{u} \\)\n- Initial velocity of α-particle, \\( v_{\\text{initial}} \\)\n- Initial velocity of O¹⁶ nucleus, \\( 0 \\)\n\n**Conservation of Momentum:**\n\\[\nm v_{\\text{initial}} = m v_{\\text{final}} + M V_{\\text{final}}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( M = 4m \\):\n\\[\nv_{\\text{initial}} = v_{\\text{final}} + 4 V_{\\text{final}} \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\n\n**Conservation of Kinetic Energy:**\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\text{initial}}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\text{final}}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} M V_{\\text{final}}^2\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( M = 4m \\):\n\\[\nv_{\\text{initial}}^2 = v_{\\text{final}}^2 + 4 V_{\\text{final}}^2 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n\\]\n\n**Solving the System:**\nFrom equation (1), express \\( v_{\\text{final}} \\):\n\\[\nv_{\\text{final}} = v_{\\text{initial}} - 4 V_{\\text{final}}\n\\]\nSubstitute into equation (2):\n\\[\nv_{\\text{initial}}^2 = (v_{\\text{initial}} - 4 V_{\\text{final}})^2 + 4 V_{\\text{final}}^2\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\\[\nv_{\\text{initial}}^2 = v_{\\text{initial}}^2 - 8 v_{\\text{initial}} V_{\\text{final}} + 20 V_{\\text{final}}^2\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = -8 v_{\\text{initial}} V_{\\text{final}} + 20 V_{\\text{final}}^2\n\\]\n\\[\nV_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{2}{5} v_{\\text{initial}}\n\\]\nSubstitute \\( V_{\\text{final}} \\) back into equation (1):\n\\[\nv_{\\text{final}} = -\\frac{3}{5} v_{\\text{initial}}\n\\]\n\n**Kinetic Energy Change:**\nFinal kinetic energy of the α-particle:\n\\[\nK_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{1}{2} m \\left( -\\frac{3}{5} v_{\\text{initial}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{25} K_{\\text{initial}}\n\\]\nFractional change:\n\\[\n\\frac{K_{\\text{final}} - K_{\\text{initial}}}{K_{\\text{initial}}} = \\frac{\\frac{9}{25} K_{\\text{initial}} - K_{\\text{initial}}}{K_{\\text{initial}}} = -\\frac{16}{25}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{-\\dfrac{16}{25}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["-\\dfrac{16}{25}", "-\\dfrac{16}{25}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "-\\dfrac{16}{25}", "expr2": "\\frac{E' - E}{E} = -\\frac{16}{25}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "-16/25", "expr2": "-16/25"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "-\\dfrac{16}{25}", "expr2": "\\frac{E' - E}{E} = -\\frac{16}{25}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "-16/25", "expr2": "-16/25"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "atomic/3-4", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question about why the proton has a parity while the muon doesn't. Hmm, I need to recall what parity means in particle physics. Parity is a symmetry property related to spatial inversion, right? So, when you invert the coordinates of a particle's wavefunction, the parity determines if it stays the same or changes sign.\n\nNow, the question is why protons have a defined parity but muons don't. The options given are about conservation in electromagnetism, familiarity, or something about reactions relative to each other. Let me think. Parity is an intrinsic quantum number, but for some particles, it's not well-defined unless there's a reference. Wait, I remember that for particles like the proton, which are baryons, their parity is defined relative to other particles through reactions. But for leptons like the muon, maybe parity isn't assigned because there's no reaction that defines it. \n\nWait, parity isn't conserved in the weak interaction, but electromagnetism does conserve parity. So option (a) says parity isn't conserved in electromagnetism, which I think is incorrect. Electromagnetism does conserve parity. So (a) might be wrong. \n\nOption (b) says the proton is better known. That seems like a trick answer. Just because we know more about protons doesn't mean their parity is defined. So probably not (b). \n\nOption (c) says parity is defined from reactions relative to each other, so it's meaningful for the proton but not the muon. That makes sense. Because for composite particles like the proton (which is made of quarks), their parity is determined by the intrinsic parities of their constituents and their orbital angular momentum. But for elementary particles like the muon, which are fundamental, their parity is conventionally set. Wait, but wait. Wait, actually, for elementary particles like electrons, muons, etc., their intrinsic parity is defined. Wait, but maybe the question is getting at something else. \n\nWait, maybe the proton's parity is defined relative to other particles through interactions, whereas the muon's parity isn't because there's no such reference. Wait, but electrons and muons are leptons, and their parity is usually taken as +1 by convention. But maybe the question is pointing out that for the proton, parity is determined through reactions (like in strong interactions where parity is conserved), so it's meaningful. But for the muon, since parity isn't conserved in weak interactions (which the muon participates in), maybe its parity isn't a meaningful quantum number. Wait, but electromagnetism does conserve parity, and muons do interact electromagnetically. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (c) because parity assignments are relative. For example, the proton's parity is defined in terms of reactions with other particles, like pions, whereas the muon doesn't have such a reference. Wait, but historically, the parity of particles like the pion is determined through their decay, and then other particles' parities are defined relative to that. But for the muon, since it's a lepton and perhaps there's no reaction that defines its parity relative to others, maybe its parity isn't assigned. Wait, but I thought that for leptons, their intrinsic parity is conventionally taken as +1. So maybe the answer is (c) because parity is defined relative to reactions, and for the muon, there's no such reaction to define it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the muon's parity isn't considered because it's a fundamental particle, and parity is only meaningful for composite particles. But that doesn't sound right. Electrons have parity, right? Wait, but maybe in the Standard Model, the parity of leptons isn't a conserved quantity because of the weak interaction's violation. So perhaps the muon's parity isn't a meaningful quantum number because parity isn't conserved in the interactions it participates in. But the proton, being a baryon involved in strong interactions (which conserve parity), has a well-defined parity. \n\nWait, but the strong interaction does conserve parity, so particles like protons (which are made via strong interactions) have their parity determined. The muon, being a lepton, primarily interacts via the weak force (which doesn't conserve parity) and electromagnetism (which does). But electromagnetism alone might not be enough to define parity. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (c) because parity is defined relative to reactions. For example, the proton's parity is defined in terms of reactions where parity conservation is assumed, like in strong interactions. But for the muon, since there's no such reaction that can define its parity (because weak interactions don't conserve parity), its parity isn't assigned. So the answer would be (c). \n\nSo, putting it all together, the correct answer is (c) because parity is defined through reactions where it's conserved, like in the strong interaction for protons, but for muons, which are involved in parity-violating weak interactions, their parity isn't meaningfully defined in the same way.\n</think>\n\nThe parity of a particle is a quantum number related to its behavior under spatial inversion. For the proton, parity is well-defined because it is determined through reactions governed by the strong interaction, which conserves parity. The proton's parity is established relative to other particles in such interactions. In contrast, the muon primarily interacts via the weak force, which does not conserve parity. Since parity is not conserved in weak interactions, there is no consistent framework to define the muon's parity through such reactions. While electromagnetism (which does conserve parity) also affects the muon, it alone does not provide a sufficient basis for assigning parity. Thus, the proton's parity is meaningful due to its role in parity-conserving strong interactions, whereas the muon's parity lacks a definitive reference in parity-violating weak interactions.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["C"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "C", "expr2": "c"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "C", "expr2": "c"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/3-3", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this physics problem. It's part (a), (b), and (c), so I need to make sure I cover all three. Let me start with part (a), explaining each term: boson, fermion, hadron, lepton, baryon.\n\nFirst, bosons and fermions are categories based on spin. Bosons have integer spin (0, 1, 2...), and they follow Bose-Einstein statistics, which means they can occupy the same quantum state. Fermions have half-integer spin (1/2, 3/2...), obey the Pauli exclusion principle, so they can't occupy the same quantum state. That's the basic difference.\n\nThen hadrons. Hadrons are particles made of quarks, held together by the strong force. They come in two types: baryons and mesons. Baryons are made of three quarks, like protons and neutrons. Mesons are quark-antiquark pairs. So hadron is a broader category that includes baryons and mesons.\n\nLeptons are elementary particles that don't experience the strong interaction. Examples include electrons, muons, neutrinos. They are fermions because they have half-integer spin. So leptons are a separate class from hadrons since they aren't made of quarks.\n\nBaryon, as mentioned, is a type of hadron made of three quarks. Protons and neutrons are the most common examples. They are fermions because their spin is half-integer.\n\nNow part (b) requires examples. For boson, maybe a photon? Photon is a gauge boson, spin 1. Fermion example could be an electron, which is a lepton and has spin 1/2. Hadron example: proton (since it's a baryon, which is a hadron). Lepton example: electron again. Baryon example: proton or neutron.\n\nWait, but part (b) says one example for each term. So boson: photon. Fermion: electron. Hadron: proton. Lepton: electron. Baryon: proton. Wait, but electron is both a fermion and a lepton. That's okay because the question asks for one example for each term, even if some particles fit multiple categories.\n\nPart (c) asks which of the above names apply to the photon. The terms are boson, fermion, hadron, lepton, baryon. Photon is a boson (spin 1), so boson applies. It's not a fermion (since fermions have half-integer spin). Not a hadron (since hadrons are made of quarks, photon is elementary). Not a lepton (leptons are like electrons, neutrinos; photon is a gauge boson). Not a baryon (which is a type of hadron). So only boson is applicable.\n</think>\n\n(a)  \n- **Boson**: A particle with integer spin (0, 1, 2, ...) that obeys Bose-Einstein statistics, allowing multiple bosons to occupy the same quantum state.  \n- **Fermion**: A particle with half-integer spin (1/2, 3/2, ...) that follows the Pauli exclusion principle, preventing identical fermions from occupying the same quantum state.  \n- **Hadron**: A composite particle made of quarks held together by the strong interaction. Includes baryons (three quarks) and mesons (quark-antiquark pairs).  \n- **Lepton**: An elementary particle that does not participate in the strong interaction. Leptons are fermions (e.g., electrons, neutrinos).  \n- **Baryon**: A type of hadron composed of three quarks. Baryons are fermions due to their half-integer spin.  \n\n(b) Examples:  \n- **Boson**: Photon  \n- **Fermion**: Electron  \n- **Hadron**: Proton  \n- **Lepton**: Electron  \n- **Baryon**: Proton  \n\n(c) Applicability to the photon:  \n- **Applicable**: Boson (photon is a spin-1 gauge boson).  \n- **Not applicable**: Fermion, hadron, lepton, baryon (photon is not a composite particle, has integer spin, and does not belong to lepton/hadron families).  \n\nFinal answers:  \n(a) Definitions provided.  \n(b) Examples: \\[ \\boxed{\\text{Photon, Electron, Proton, Electron, Proton}} \\]  \n(c) Applicable: \\[ \\boxed{\\text{Boson}} \\]; Not applicable: \\[ \\boxed{\\text{Fermion, Hadron, Lepton, Baryon}} \\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Photon, Electron, Proton, Electron, Proton}", "\\text{Boson}", "\\text{Fermion, Hadron, Lepton, Baryon}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Photon, Electron, Proton, Electron, Proton}", "expr2": "\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Fermion:} & \\text{ All particles of half-integer spins.} \\\\\n\\text{Boson:} & \\text{ All particles of integer spins.} \\\\\n\\text{Hadron:} & \\text{ Particles which are subject to strong interaction.} \\\\\n\\text{Lepton:} & \\text{ Particles not subject to strong interaction but to weak interaction.} \\\\\n\\text{Baryon:} & \\text{ Hadrons of half-integer spins.} \\\\\n\\end{align*}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Photon, Electron, Proton, Electron, Proton}", "expr2": "\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Boson:} & \\; \\pi \\text{ meson} \\\\\n\\text{Fermion:} & \\; \\text{proton} \\\\\n\\text{Hadron:} & \\; \\text{proton} \\\\\n\\text{Lepton:} & \\; \\text{neutrino} \\\\\n\\text{Baryon:} & \\; \\text{proton} \\\\\n\\end{align*}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Photon, Electron, Proton, Electron, Proton}", "expr2": "\\text{The name boson is applicable to photon, but not the other names.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Boson}", "expr2": "\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Fermion:} & \\text{ All particles of half-integer spins.} \\\\\n\\text{Boson:} & \\text{ All particles of integer spins.} \\\\\n\\text{Hadron:} & \\text{ Particles which are subject to strong interaction.} \\\\\n\\text{Lepton:} & \\text{ Particles not subject to strong interaction but to weak interaction.} \\\\\n\\text{Baryon:} & \\text{ Hadrons of half-integer spins.} \\\\\n\\end{align*}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Boson}", "expr2": "\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Boson:} & \\; \\pi \\text{ meson} \\\\\n\\text{Fermion:} & \\; \\text{proton} \\\\\n\\text{Hadron:} & \\; \\text{proton} \\\\\n\\text{Lepton:} & \\; \\text{neutrino} \\\\\n\\text{Baryon:} & \\; \\text{proton} \\\\\n\\end{align*}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Fermion, Hadron, Lepton, Baryon}", "expr2": "\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Fermion:} & \\text{ All particles of half-integer spins.} \\\\\n\\text{Boson:} & \\text{ All particles of integer spins.} \\\\\n\\text{Hadron:} & \\text{ Particles which are subject to strong interaction.} \\\\\n\\text{Lepton:} & \\text{ Particles not subject to strong interaction but to weak interaction.} \\\\\n\\text{Baryon:} & \\text{ Hadrons of half-integer spins.} \\\\\n\\end{align*}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Fermion, Hadron, Lepton, Baryon}", "expr2": "\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Boson:} & \\; \\pi \\text{ meson} \\\\\n\\text{Fermion:} & \\; \\text{proton} \\\\\n\\text{Hadron:} & \\; \\text{proton} \\\\\n\\text{Lepton:} & \\; \\text{neutrino} \\\\\n\\text{Baryon:} & \\; \\text{proton} \\\\\n\\end{align*}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Fermion, Hadron, Lepton, Baryon}", "expr2": "\\text{The name boson is applicable to photon, but not the other names.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.6666666666666666}
{"id": "atomic/3-32", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question has three parts (a, b, c) and asks about experiments that determined those facts, and then to deduce the spin, isospin, and charge of the η⁰ particle based on those facts. \n\nStarting with part (a): The η⁰ is produced in the reaction π⁻ + p → η⁰ + n, and the note says that π⁻ + p → η⁻ + p isn't observed. First, I need to recall what s-wave production implies. S-wave means the orbital angular momentum l=0. Since the reaction is happening via s-waves, the total angular momentum J of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. \n\nThe initial particles are π⁻ (spin 0) and proton (spin 1/2). So the total spin can be 1/2. The orbital angular momentum is 0 (s-wave), so total J is 1/2. The final state is η⁰ (spin?) and neutron (spin 1/2). So their total spin would be the combination of η⁰'s spin and neutron's spin. To conserve angular momentum, the η⁰ must have spin such that when combined with the neutron's spin (1/2), the total can be 1/2. That suggests that η⁰'s spin is 0 or 1. But let's think more carefully. If η⁰ has spin 0, then the total spin of the final state is just the neutron's 1/2, which matches the initial J=1/2. If η⁰ had spin 1, then combining with neutron's 1/2 could give 1/2 or 3/2. But since the initial J is 1/2, the final state must have J=1/2. So possible if η⁰ has spin 0. Alternatively, maybe spin 1 but with some combination. But since the process is allowed, and the other reaction (producing η⁻ + p) isn't observed, maybe there's something about isospin here. \n\nWait, part (a) says that η⁰ is produced in s-wave, which implies that the reaction can proceed with l=0. The other reaction (η⁻ + p) isn't observed. So maybe the isospin considerations are important here. Let's think about the isospin of the initial and final states. \n\nThe initial state is π⁻ (which is in the I=1 triplet, with I₃=-1) and proton (which is part of the I=1/2 doublet, with I₃=+1/2). So combining these, the total isospin can be I=1/2 or 3/2. The final state for the observed reaction is η⁰ + n. The neutron has I=1/2, I₃=-1/2. The η⁰ must have isospin I=0 because it's a neutral particle and if it's an isosinglet, then the total isospin of the final state would be I=1/2 (since neutron is I=1/2). So the initial state must have I=1/2 to match. Therefore, the reaction π⁻ + p → η⁰ + n proceeds via the I=1/2 channel. The other reaction, η⁻ + p, would require the η⁻ to have isospin. If η⁻ were part of an isospin multiplet, but since η⁰ is an isosinglet (I=0), η⁻ can't exist because there's no multiplet. Hence, the absence of the η⁻ + p channel suggests that η⁰ is an isosinglet (I=0). \n\nSo from part (a), we can infer that η⁰ has isospin I=0. Because if it had non-zero isospin, then there would be charged partners, but they aren't observed. The fact that the other reaction isn't observed supports that η⁰ is an isosinglet. \n\nMoving to part (b): The decay modes. The dominant decay is η⁰ → 2γ (38%), then 3π (30%), and 2π is suppressed (<0.15%). Let's think about what these decays imply about the spin and parity (J^P) of η⁰. \n\nFor η⁰ → 2γ: The two-photon decay. Photons are spin-1, so the total spin of the two photons must combine to the spin of η⁰. Since photons are bosons, the wavefunction must be symmetric. For two photons, their spins can combine to total spin 0, 1, or 2. But since the η⁰ is a neutral particle, it must have integer spin. If η⁰ has spin 0, then the two photons must have total spin 0. However, two photons in a spin-0 state must have even angular momentum. Wait, but the decay of a spin-0 particle into two photons would require angular momentum l=0 (since initial angular momentum is 0). But photons are vector particles, so the decay amplitude must consider their polarization. For a spin-0 particle to decay into two photons, the amplitude must be symmetric under exchange of the photons. The Landau-Yang theorem says that a spin-1 particle cannot decay into two photons. So spin 0 or 2. But η⁰ decays into two photons, so possible spin 0. \n\nFor the decay into 3π: η⁰ → 3π. The pions are spin 0, so the total spin here would also have to be the spin of η⁰. The 3π system would have to have angular momentum matching η⁰'s spin. But 3 pions can have various orbital angular momenta. However, the parity is important. The parity of η⁰ must be such that the decay is allowed. The parity of 3 pions is (-1)^3 = -1 (since each pion has parity -1). So if η⁰ has parity +1, then the decay η⁰ → 3π would require a parity change, which is possible if the decay is via the weak interaction, but since the decay is observed with 30% probability, which is significant, it's more likely a strong or electromagnetic decay. Wait, but η⁰ has a lifetime that's not too short, so maybe it's a electromagnetic decay. Wait, but the 3π decay would require parity violation if η⁰ has parity +1. Wait, but the parity of the η⁰: if it's a pseudoscalar meson (J^P=0^-), then its decay into 3π (parity (-1)^3 = -1) would require that the decay conserves parity. Wait, parity of initial state is P_initial = P_η = -1 (if it's pseudoscalar). The final state parity is P_final = (-1)^3 * (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum. For the decay to conserve parity (if it's a strong or electromagnetic decay), then P_initial = P_final. So -1 = (-1)^3 * (-1)^l → -1 = (-1)^{3 + l} → -1 = (-1)^{l +3}. Let's compute: (-1)^{l +3} = (-1)^l * (-1)^3 = (-1)^l * (-1). So equation: -1 = (-1)^l * (-1) → (-1)^l = 1 → l even. So the orbital angular momentum in the 3π system must be even. But since the η⁰ has spin 0, the total angular momentum of the decay products must be 0. The 3 pions are spin 0, so their total spin is 0, and the orbital angular momentum must also be 0 (since J=0). But if l must be even, then l=0 is allowed. So parity would be conserved if η⁰ is pseudoscalar (0^-). Therefore, the 3π decay is allowed for a pseudoscalar η⁰. \n\nBut wait, the 2π decay is suppressed. η⁰ → 2π is <0.15%. For a pseudoscalar (0^-) decaying into two pions (each 0^-), the parity of the final state is (-1)^2 = +1. The initial parity is -1. So parity would change, which is not allowed in strong or electromagnetic interactions. Therefore, the 2π decay would be forbidden if parity is conserved in the decay. Hence, the suppression of 2π decay suggests that the decay is parity-violating, which would imply it's a weak interaction decay. But since the 2γ decay is allowed (electromagnetic), and 3π is allowed via strong or electromagnetic (if parity conserved), but 2π is suppressed. Therefore, the η⁰ must have J^P=0^- (pseudoscalar), which would allow 2γ (with appropriate angular momentum) and 3π, but forbid 2π via parity conservation. The 2π decay is suppressed because it violates parity, so it can only proceed via the weak interaction, which is much slower, hence the small branching ratio. \n\nSo from part (b), the decay modes suggest that η⁰ has spin 0 (since two photons would require even spin, but dominant decay is 2γ, which for spin 0 is possible as per Landau-Yang theorem allows spin 0 or 2, but combined with the 3π decay which is easier with spin 0). Also, the parity is negative (pseudoscalar) because of the 3π decay's parity considerations. \n\nPart (c) gives the rest mass, which is 548.8 MeV. The mass might be determined via experiments like measuring the energy and momentum of the decay products and using invariant mass calculations. For example, in bubble chamber experiments or using detectors in accelerators, by measuring the tracks of the decay products (like photons, pions), one can reconstruct the invariant mass, which would peak at the η⁰ mass. \n\nNow, putting it all together to find spin, isospin, and charge. \n\nSpin: From the decay to two photons, considering Landau-Yang theorem which forbids spin 1. The possible spins are 0 or 2. But the 3π decay favors spin 0 because higher spin would require more complex angular momentum couplings. Also, the production in s-wave (part a) suggests spin 0. Because in the reaction π⁻ + p → η⁰ + n, the initial total angular momentum is 1/2 (since π has spin 0, p has spin 1/2, l=0). The final state has η⁰ (spin J) and neutron (spin 1/2). To get total J=1/2, η⁰ must have spin 0 (since 0 + 1/2 can couple to 1/2). If η⁰ had spin 1, then combining with neutron's spin 1/2 could give 1/2 or 3/2. But the initial J is 1/2, so the final J must be 1/2. So possible if η⁰ has spin 0. Therefore, spin 0. \n\nIsospin: From part (a), the reaction's isospin consideration. The initial state has π⁻ (I=1, I₃=-1) and proton (I=1/2, I₃=+1/2). The possible total I can be 1/2 or 3/2. The final state is η⁰ (I=?) and neutron (I=1/2, I₃=-1/2). If η⁰ is an isosinglet (I=0), then the total isospin of the final state is 1/2. Therefore, the initial state must also have I=1/2. The reaction proceeds via I=1/2 channel. The absence of η⁻ + p suggests that η cannot be part of an isospin multiplet (since η⁻ would have I₃=-1 if η is in a triplet, but η⁰ is I=0, so no charged partners). Hence, η⁰ must have I=0. \n\nCharge: The η⁰ is neutral, as indicated by its name. The charge can be determined from the production reaction: π⁻ (charge -1) + proton (charge +1) → η⁰ (charge 0) + neutron (charge 0). So charge conservation gives -1 +1 = 0 +0, which holds. Hence, η⁰ charge is 0. \n\nSo summarizing:\n\n- Spin J=0 (from s-wave production and decay modes)\n- Isospin I=0 (from absence of charged partners and isospin conservation in reaction)\n- Charge Q=0 (as observed in the reaction and name)\n- Parity P=-1 (from decay modes, especially suppression of 2π decay)\n</think>\n\nThe experiments and reasoning to determine the spin, isospin, and charge of the $\\eta^0$ particle are as follows:\n\n### **Experiments for Facts (a), (b), (c):**\n1. **Production Reaction (a):**  \n   The reaction $\\pi^- + p \\rightarrow \\eta^0 + n$ is studied using fixed-target experiments or colliders. By analyzing angular distributions of the final-state particles, the $s$-wave ($l=0$) dominance is confirmed. The absence of $\\pi^- + p \\rightarrow \\eta^- + p$ is verified by searching for charged $\\eta$ partners, which are not observed.\n\n2. **Decay Modes (b):**  \n   Branching ratios are measured using detectors (e.g., bubble chambers, calorimeters) to track decay products. The suppression of $\\eta^0 \\rightarrow 2\\pi$ is determined by comparing its rate to $2\\gamma$ and $3\\pi$ decays. Parity conservation in strong/electromagnetic interactions explains the suppression of $2\\pi$ decays.\n\n3. **Rest Mass (c):**  \n   The $\\eta^0$ mass is measured via invariant mass reconstruction of its decay products (e.g., $2\\gamma$ or $3\\pi$). A peak at 548.8 MeV in the invariant mass spectrum confirms its rest mass.\n\n---\n\n### **Inferred Properties:**\n1. **Spin ($J$):**  \n   - **Production in $s$-waves:** Initial total angular momentum $J = 1/2$ (from $\\pi^-$ spin 0 + proton spin $1/2$). Final state $\\eta^0$ (spin $J_{\\eta}$) + neutron (spin $1/2$) must also have $J = 1/2$. This requires $J_{\\eta} = 0$.  \n   - **Decay to $2\\gamma$:** Landau-Yang theorem allows $J = 0$ or $2$, but $J = 0$ aligns with $3\\pi$ decay dynamics.  \n   **Conclusion:** $\\boxed{J = 0}$.\n\n2. **Isospin ($I$):**  \n   - **Reaction (a):** Initial state ($\\pi^- + p$) has $I = 1/2$ or $3/2$. Final state ($\\eta^0 + n$) must match $I = 1/2$ (neutron $I = 1/2$). Hence, $\\eta^0$ must have $I = 0$ (isosinglet).  \n   - **No $\\eta^-$ observed:** Charged partners would exist if $\\eta^0$ had $I > 0$.  \n   **Conclusion:** $\\boxed{I = 0}$.\n\n3. **Charge ($Q$):**  \n   - **Charge conservation in (a):** $\\pi^-$ ($Q = -1$) + proton ($Q = +1$) $\\rightarrow \\eta^0$ ($Q = 0$) + neutron ($Q = 0$).  \n   **Conclusion:** $\\boxed{Q = 0}$.\n\n4. **Parity ($P$):**  \n   - **$\\eta^0 \\rightarrow 3\\pi$:** Parity of $3\\pi$ is $(-1)^3 = -1$.

{"id": "atomic/4-25", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to tackle these two physics problems. Let's start with part (a): proving that an electron-positron pair can't be created by a single isolated photon. Hmm, I remember that pair production is when a photon converts into a particle and its antiparticle, like an electron and positron. But why can't a single photon do this? Maybe it's something to do with conservation laws. Let me think.\n\nConservation of energy and momentum must hold. If a photon with energy E creates an electron and a positron, each with mass m_e, then the rest mass energy required is 2m_e c². So the photon must have at least that much energy. But even if the energy is sufficient, maybe the momentum doesn't work out. Let's see.\n\nThe photon has energy E = hf and momentum p = E/c. The electron and positron would have some momenta. Let's consider the center-of-momentum frame. Wait, but the photon is moving, so maybe in the lab frame where the photon is moving, but the electron and positron are produced. If the photon is isolated, there's nothing else to provide recoil. So in the rest frame of the photon... Wait, photons don't have a rest frame because they always move at c. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, let's analyze this in any inertial frame. Suppose the photon is moving along the x-direction. After pair production, the electron and positron must have some momenta. Let's assume they are produced at rest for the minimum energy case. But if they are at rest, their total momentum is zero. However, the photon's momentum was E/c in one direction. So momentum can't be conserved because the initial momentum is non-zero, and the final momentum is zero. Therefore, that's impossible. So even if the photon has enough energy, the momentum can't be conserved. Therefore, pair production by a single photon is impossible.\n\nBut wait, maybe they aren't at rest. Let's say they have some momenta p1 and p2. Then total momentum after the process is p1 + p2. But the initial momentum is p_photon = E/c in some direction. So we need p1 + p2 = p_photon. But energy must also be conserved. The total energy of the electron and positron would be sqrt(p1²c² + m_e²c⁴) + sqrt(p2²c² + m_e²c⁴) = E_photon. But even if we try to solve these equations, maybe there's no solution. Let's try to see.\n\nLet me consider the scenario where the electron and positron move in the same direction as the photon. Then their momenta would have to add up to the photon's momentum. But since they have mass, their momentum is related to their velocity. Let's suppose they have equal and opposite momenta perpendicular to the photon's direction? Wait, but the photon's momentum is all in one direction. If the pair have momenta in that direction, their total momentum must equal the photon's. Let's set up equations.\n\nLet’s denote the photon's energy as E_photon = hν, and its momentum p_photon = E_photon / c. The electron and positron each have energy E_e = sqrt(p²c² + m_e²c⁴). The total energy after is 2E_e, and the total momentum is 2p (if they move in opposite directions, but that would give zero total momentum. Wait, but the photon's momentum is non-zero. So maybe they have to move in the same direction. Wait, but if they both move in the same direction as the photon, their momenta would add up. Let's say each has momentum p. Then total momentum is 2p = p_photon = E_photon / c. Then energy conservation would require 2*sqrt(p²c² + m_e²c⁴) = E_photon. But substituting p = E_photon/(2c), we get:\n\n2*sqrt( (E_photon²/(4c²))c² + m_e²c⁴ ) = E_photon\n\nSimplify inside the sqrt:\n\nsqrt( E_photon²/4 + m_e²c⁴ ) * 2 = E_photon\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nsqrt( E_photon²/4 + m_e²c⁴ ) = E_photon / 2\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nE_photon²/4 + m_e²c⁴ = E_photon²/4\n\nSubtract E_photon²/4 from both sides:\n\nm_e²c⁴ = 0\n\nWhich is impossible because m_e is non-zero. Therefore, there's no solution where the electron and positron have equal momenta in the same direction as the photon. So this suggests that even if energy is sufficient, momentum can't be conserved. Therefore, a single photon can't produce an electron-positron pair because it's impossible to conserve both energy and momentum. Hence, pair production requires another particle to take away some momentum. That's part (a).\n\nNow part (b): Show numerically that neglecting the kinetic energy of the recoil nucleus in the threshold energy for pair production is justified when the nucleus is lead. \n\nI recall that in pair production, the threshold condition occurs when the photon has just enough energy to create the rest mass of the electron and positron, plus any kinetic energy from the recoiling nucleus. But because the nucleus is very massive, its recoil kinetic energy is negligible. Let's verify this.\n\nThe threshold condition for pair production in the presence of a nucleus (which provides the necessary recoil) is when the photon's energy E_photon is just enough to create the two electrons (2m_e c²) plus the kinetic energy of the nucleus. But since the nucleus is heavy, its kinetic energy is very small. Let's model this.\n\nLet’s consider conservation of energy and momentum. At threshold, the electron and positron are produced at rest, so their total momentum is zero. Therefore, the initial momentum of the photon must equal the momentum of the recoiling nucleus. Let’s denote the nucleus mass as M, its recoil momentum as p, and its kinetic energy as K = p²/(2M). \n\nEnergy conservation: E_photon = 2m_e c² + K\n\nMomentum conservation: p = E_photon / c\n\nSo substituting p from momentum into energy equation:\n\nE_photon = 2m_e c² + (E_photon²)/(2M c²)\n\nLet’s rearrange this equation:\n\nE_photon - (E_photon²)/(2M c²) = 2m_e c²\n\nMultiply both sides by 2M c²:\n\n2M c² E_photon - E_photon² = 4 M c² m_e c²\n\nRearranged:\n\nE_photon² - 2M c² E_photon + 4 M c² m_e c² = 0\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way. Let's denote x = E_photon. Then:\n\nx = 2m_e c² + x²/(2M c²)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2M c²:\n\n2M c² x = 4 M c² m_e c² + x²\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nx² - 2M c² x + 4 M c² m_e c² = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in x. Let's solve for x:\n\nx = [2M c² ± sqrt( (2M c²)^2 - 16 M c² m_e c² )]/2\n\nSimplify discriminant:\n\n(4 M² c^4 - 16 M c² m_e c² ) = 4 M c² (M c² - 4 m_e c² )\n\nAssuming M is much larger than m_e, the square root term is approximately 2M c² sqrt(1 - (4 m_e)/(M)). Since M >> m_e, this is approximately 2M c² (1 - (2 m_e)/M). So:\n\nx ≈ [2M c² ± 2M c² (1 - (2 m_e)/M ) ] / 2\n\nTake the positive root because energy must be positive:\n\nx ≈ [2M c² + 2M c² - 4 m_e c² ] / 2 = [4M c² -4 m_e c² ] /2 = 2M c² - 2 m_e c²\n\nBut this seems off because if M is very large, the threshold energy would be very large, which contradicts the idea that the threshold is around 2m_e c². Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approximation.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that M is very large, so the term x²/(2M c²) is small compared to x. Then, the equation x ≈ 2m_e c² + x²/(2M c²). If x is approximately 2m_e c², then x²/(2M c²) ≈ (4 m_e² c^4)/(2M c²) = (2 m_e² c²)/M. Since M is the mass of a lead nucleus, which is about 207 times the mass of a proton, and a proton is about 1836 times the electron mass. So M ≈ 207 * 1836 m_e ≈ 3.8e5 m_e. Therefore, (2 m_e² c²)/M ≈ 2 m_e c² / 3.8e5 ≈ 5e-6 m_e c². So this term is negligible compared to 2m_e c². Therefore, the threshold energy is approximately 2m_e c², and the correction due to the nucleus recoil is very small. Hence, we can neglect the kinetic energy of the nucleus.\n\nTo show numerically, let's compute the threshold energy with and without considering the recoil. Let's take M as the mass of a lead nucleus. Lead has atomic number around 208, so mass number A=208. The mass of the nucleus is approximately A * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass. m_p ≈ 1836 m_e.\n\nSo M = 208 * 1836 m_e ≈ 3.82e5 m_e.\n\nThe threshold energy E_threshold is given by:\n\nE_threshold = 2m_e c² + (E_threshold)^2 / (2 M c²)\n\nAssuming E_threshold ≈ 2m_e c², substitute into the second term:\n\n(E_threshold)^2 / (2 M c²) ≈ (4 m_e² c^4) / (2 M c²) ) = (2 m_e² c²)/M = 2 m_e c² (m_e / M)\n\nSince M = 3.82e5 m_e, this term is 2 m_e c² / 3.82e5 ≈ 5.24e-6 m_e c². So the kinetic energy of the nucleus is about 5.24e-6 times the electron rest mass energy. Therefore, the correction is on the order of 0.0005% of the rest mass energy, which is negligible. Therefore, we are justified in neglecting it.\n\nSo part (b) is shown numerically by calculating the recoil kinetic energy and showing it's tiny compared to 2m_e c².\n</think>\n\n(a) To prove that a single photon cannot create an electron-positron pair, consider conservation of energy and momentum. The photon's energy is \\(E_\\gamma = h\\nu\\) and momentum \\(p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma/c\\). For pair production, the total rest energy required is \\(2m_e c^2\\). Suppose the photon has sufficient energy (\\(E_\\gamma \\geq 2m_e c^2\\)). However, momentum conservation requires the total momentum of the electron-positron pair to equal \\(p_\\gamma\\). If the pair is at rest, their total momentum is zero, violating conservation. If they have momenta \\(\\mathbf{p}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{p}_2\\), energy conservation gives:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{p_1^2 c^2 + m_e^2 c^4} + \\sqrt{p_2^2 c^2 + m_e^2 c^4} = E_\\gamma,\n\\]\n\nand momentum conservation requires \\(\\mathbf{p}_1 + \\mathbf{p}_2 = \\mathbf{p}_\\gamma\\). Assuming the pair moves in the photon's direction, solving these equations leads to a contradiction (e.g., \\(m_e = 0\\)), proving no solution exists. Thus, a single photon cannot conserve both energy and momentum, necessitating a third particle (e.g., a nucleus) to absorb recoil momentum.\n\n(b) For a lead nucleus (mass \\(M \\approx 208 \\times 1836 m_e\\)), the threshold energy \\(E_\\text{th}\\) satisfies:\n\n\\[\nE_\\text{th} = 2m_e c^2 + \\frac{E_\\text{th}^2}{2Mc^2}.\n\\]\n\nApproximating \\(E_\\text{th} \\approx 2m_e c^2\\), the recoil kinetic energy is:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{E_\\text{th}^2}{2Mc^2} \\approx \\frac{(2m_e c^2)^2}{2Mc^2} = \\frac{2m_e^2 c^2}{M}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(M \\approx 3.82 \\times 10^5 m_e\\), we find:\n\n\\[\nK \\approx \\frac{2m_e^2 c^2}{3.82 \\times 10^5 m_e} = \\frac{2m_e c^2}{3.82 \\times 10^5} \\approx 5.24 \\times 10^{-6} m_e c^2.\n\\]\n\nThis is negligible compared to \\(2m_e c^2\\) (≈0.0005%), justifying the neglect of the nucleus's kinetic energy.\n\nFinal answers:\n(a) \\[\n\\boxed{\\text{A single photon cannot create an electron-positron pair due to conservation laws.}}\n\\]\n(b) \\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Recoil kinetic energy of lead nucleus is negligible, validating its neglect.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{A single photon cannot create an electron-positron pair due to conservation laws.}", "\\text{Recoil kinetic energy of lead nucleus is negligible, validating its neglect.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{A single photon cannot create an electron-positron pair due to conservation laws.}", "expr2": "\\text{Pair production by a single isolated photon is not possible because energy and momentum cannot both be conserved.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Recoil kinetic energy of lead nucleus is negligible, validating its neglect.}", "expr2": "\\text{Pair production by a single isolated photon is not possible because energy and momentum cannot both be conserved.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Recoil kinetic energy of lead nucleus is negligible, validating its neglect.}", "expr2": "T_{\\text{Pb}} \\approx 2.7 \\times 10^{-6} \\times E_\\gamma"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.5}
{"id": "atomic/4-13", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a relativistic collision where one particle is moving with kinetic energy 2m₀c² and hits another stationary particle with rest mass 2m₀. They stick together, and we need to find the rest mass of the composite particle and its velocity. \n\nFirst, part (a) asks for the rest mass of the composite. Hmm, in relativistic collisions, conservation of energy and momentum are key. Since the collision is inelastic (they stick together), the rest mass of the composite isn't just the sum of their rest masses because kinetic energy contributes to the rest mass energy in the combined system. \n\nLet me recall the formulas. The total energy of a particle is γm₀c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The momentum is γm₀v. For the moving particle, its kinetic energy is given as 2m₀c². Wait, kinetic energy is (γ - 1)m₀c². So, if KE = 2m₀c², then (γ - 1)m₀c² = 2m₀c². Solving for γ: γ - 1 = 2 → γ = 3. So the Lorentz factor for the moving particle is 3. \n\nThen, the total energy of the moving particle is γm₀c² = 3m₀c². Its momentum would be γm₀v. But we need to find v. Since γ = 3, we can find v in terms of c. \n\nWe know that γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, 3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Squaring both sides: 9 = 1 / (1 - v²/c²) → 1 - v²/c² = 1/9 → v²/c² = 8/9 → v = (2√2/3)c. Let me check that: sqrt(8/9) is 2√2/3, yes. So velocity v = (2√2/3)c. \n\nNow, the momentum p of the moving particle is γm₀v = 3m₀*(2√2/3)c = 2√2 m₀c. Wait, because the 3 cancels with the denominator in v. So p = 2√2 m₀c. \n\nThe stationary particle has rest mass 2m₀, so its energy is just its rest energy: 2m₀c². Its momentum is zero since it's stationary. \n\nSo total energy before collision is 3m₀c² (from moving particle) + 2m₀c² (from stationary) = 5m₀c². \n\nTotal momentum before collision is just the momentum of the moving particle: 2√2 m₀c. \n\nAfter collision, the composite particle has rest mass M and moves with some velocity u. Its total energy is γ_u M c², and momentum is γ_u M u. \n\nBy conservation of energy: 5m₀c² = γ_u M c². \n\nBy conservation of momentum: 2√2 m₀c = γ_u M u. \n\nWe need to solve for M and u. But since M is the rest mass, it's related to the total energy and momentum by the invariant: (Total energy)^2 = (Total momentum c)^2 + (M c²)^2. \n\nWait, yes. The invariant quantity is E_total² = (p_total c)^2 + (M c²)^2. \n\nSo, substituting the total energy and total momentum:\n\n(5m₀c²)^2 = (2√2 m₀c * c)^2 + (M c²)^2. \n\nLet me compute that. \n\nLeft side: 25 m₀² c^4. \n\nRight side: (2√2 m₀c²)^2 + M² c^4. \n\nCalculating (2√2 m₀c²)^2: (2√2)^2 m₀² c^4 = 8 m₀² c^4. \n\nSo, 25 m₀² c^4 = 8 m₀² c^4 + M² c^4. \n\nSubtract 8 m₀² c^4 from both sides: 17 m₀² c^4 = M² c^4. \n\nDivide both sides by c^4: 17 m₀² = M². \n\nSo M = sqrt(17) m₀. \n\nTherefore, the rest mass of the composite is sqrt(17) m₀. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me verify the steps again. \n\nTotal energy after collision is 5m₀c², total momentum is 2√2 m₀c. Then using E² = (pc)^2 + (Mc²)^2. \n\nSo, (5m₀c²)^2 = (2√2 m₀c * c)^2 + (Mc²)^2. \n\nYes, 25 m₀²c^4 = 8 m₀²c^4 + M²c^4. \n\n25 - 8 = 17, so M² = 17 m₀², so M = sqrt(17) m₀. That seems right. \n\nSo part (a) answer is sqrt(17) m₀. \n\nFor part (b), the velocity u of the composite particle. \n\nWe can use either the conservation of energy or momentum. Let's use the expressions from conservation. \n\nFrom energy: 5m₀c² = γ_u M c². \n\nWe know M = sqrt(17) m₀, so substituting:\n\n5m₀c² = γ_u sqrt(17) m₀ c². \n\nCancel m₀c²: 5 = γ_u sqrt(17). \n\nSo γ_u = 5 / sqrt(17). \n\nSimilarly, from momentum: 2√2 m₀c = γ_u M u. \n\nAgain, substitute M = sqrt(17) m₀:\n\n2√2 m₀c = γ_u sqrt(17) m₀ u. \n\nCancel m₀:\n\n2√2 c = γ_u sqrt(17) u. \n\nBut from earlier, γ_u = 5 / sqrt(17). Substitute that in:\n\n2√2 c = (5 / sqrt(17)) * sqrt(17) * u. \n\nSimplify sqrt(17) cancels:\n\n2√2 c = 5 u. \n\nTherefore, u = (2√2 / 5) c. \n\nSo velocity is (2√2/5)c. \n\nLet me check if γ_u is consistent. \n\nγ_u = 5 / sqrt(17). \n\nCompute 1 / sqrt(1 - u²/c²) = 5 / sqrt(17). \n\nLet's compute u²/c²: (2√2/5)^2 = (8/25). \n\nSo 1 - u²/c² = 1 - 8/25 = 17/25. \n\nsqrt(17/25) = sqrt(17)/5. \n\nThus, 1 / sqrt(1 - u²/c²) = 5 / sqrt(17), which matches γ_u. So that's consistent. \n\nTherefore, the velocity is (2√2/5)c. \n\nSo summarizing:\n\n(a) Rest mass of composite is sqrt(17) m₀.\n\n(b) Velocity is (2√2/5)c. \n\nI think that's all. Let me just check once more for any calculation errors. \n\nFor part (a), the invariant calculation seems correct. The total energy squared minus (pc)^2 gives (Mc²)^2. 25 - 8 = 17, so M = sqrt(17) m₀. \n\nFor part (b), solving for u gives 2√2 c /5. The gamma factor checks out. \n\nYes, looks good.\n</think>\n\n(a) The rest mass of the composite particle is found using conservation of energy and momentum.

{"id": "atomic/1-7", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these questions one by one. Starting with part (a). The ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom. So, looking at H, He, and Li, their ionization energies are 13.6 eV, 24.6 eV, and 5.4 eV respectively. Hmm, why does it go up from H to He and then drop for Li?\n\nHydrogen has one proton and one electron. The ionization energy here is straightforward—it's the energy needed to remove that single electron from the nucleus. For helium, which has two protons, the ionization energy is higher. That makes sense because the nucleus has a higher charge, so the electron is more tightly held. But wait, helium has two electrons. The first ionization energy is removing one electron. But after that, the remaining electron would experience a higher effective nuclear charge because there's less shielding. Wait, but the first ionization energy of He is higher than H. So, He has a higher Z, and the electrons are in the same shell (n=1), so the increased nuclear charge makes the ionization energy higher than H. \n\nThen lithium has a much lower ionization energy. Lithium has Z=3, but its valence electron is in the n=2 shell. So, the electron is in a higher energy level, farther from the nucleus. Also, the inner electrons (from the first shell, n=1) shield the nuclear charge. So the effective nuclear charge experienced by the valence electron in Li is lower. That's why it's easier to remove, hence lower ionization energy. So the trend is H < He > Li. The increase from H to He is due to higher nuclear charge and same shell, but the drop from He to Li is because the valence electron is in a higher shell with more shielding.\n\nMoving to part (b), the second ionization energy of He. The first ionization energy of He is 24.6 eV, which is removing one electron from He to get He⁺. The second ionization energy would be removing the second electron from He⁺ to get He²⁺. Now, He⁺ is a hydrogen-like ion with Z=2 and a single electron. The ionization energy for a hydrogen-like atom is given by the formula E_n = (Z² * 13.6 eV)/n². Here, n=1 for the remaining electron in He⁺. So substituting Z=2, E = (2² * 13.6)/1² = 54.4 eV. So the second ionization energy should be 54.4 eV. But wait, the first ionization energy of He is 24.6 eV. That's because in neutral He, there are two electrons. The first ionization is removing one electron from the He atom, which has two electrons in the 1s orbital. The presence of the other electron provides some shielding, so the effective nuclear charge isn't fully +2. But once you remove one electron, the remaining electron in He⁺ experiences the full +2 charge without any shielding. Therefore, the second ionization energy is much higher, exactly as per the hydrogen-like formula. So the answer should be 54.4 eV.\n\nPart (c) asks why the energy levels of the n=3 states in sodium's valence electron depend on the quantum number l. Sodium has an electron configuration of [Ne] 3s¹. The valence electron is in the 3s orbital. The energy levels given are for 3s, 3p, and 3d. The energies are -5.1 eV, -3.0 eV, and -1.5 eV respectively. So lower l values have lower (more negative) energies. This is the opposite of hydrogen, where energy depends only on n. In hydrogen, all orbitals with the same n have the same energy. But in multi-electron atoms, electrons with lower l (s, p, d) have lower energy within the same n. This is due to the shielding effect and the penetration effect. Electrons in lower l orbitals (like s) have a higher probability of being closer to the nucleus (better penetration through the inner electron cloud), so they experience a higher effective nuclear charge and are more tightly bound (lower energy). For example, 3s electrons penetrate more into the core, so they are less shielded compared to 3p or 3d. Therefore, the 3s orbital has lower energy than 3p, which in turn is lower than 3d. Hence, the energy depends on l because of varying penetration and shielding effects.\n</think>\n\n(a) The ionization energy increases from hydrogen (H) to helium (He) due to helium's higher nuclear charge (\\(Z = 2\\)) and the same principal quantum number (\\(n = 1\\)) for its electrons, leading to stronger attraction. However, lithium (Li) has a much lower ionization energy because its valence electron is in the \\(n = 2\\) shell, farther from the nucleus, and experiences significant shielding from the inner \\(n = 1\\) electrons, reducing the effective nuclear charge.\n\n(b) The second ionization energy of helium corresponds to removing the remaining electron from \\(\\text{He}^+\\), forming \\(\\text{He}^{2+}\\). This is a hydrogen-like system with \\(Z = 2\\) and \\(n = 1\\). Using the formula for hydrogen-like atoms:  \n\\[\nE = Z^2 \\times 13.6\\,\\text{eV} = 2^2 \\times 13.6\\,\\text{eV} = 54.4\\,\\text{eV}.\n\\]  \nThus, the second ionization energy is \\(\\boxed{54.4\\,\\text{eV}}\\).\n\n(c) The energy levels of sodium's \\(n = 3\\) states depend on \\(l\\) due to **penetration and shielding effects**. Lower-\\(l\\) orbitals (e.g., \\(3s\\)) penetrate closer to the nucleus, experiencing less shielding from inner electrons and a higher effective nuclear charge. This results in lower (more negative) energies for \\(3s\\) compared to \\(3p\\) and \\(3d\\). The dependence on \\(l\\) arises because electrons with higher \\(l\\) are more shielded and less tightly bound.  \nFinal answer for part (c):  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Lower } l \\text{ orbitals penetrate closer to the nucleus, experiencing less shielding and higher effective nuclear charge, leading to lower energy.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["54.4\\,\\text{eV}", "\\text{Lower } l \\text{ orbitals penetrate closer to the nucleus, experiencing less shielding and higher effective nuclear charge, leading to lower energy.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "54.4\\,\\text{eV}", "expr2": "\\text{The ionization energy increases from H to He due to increased nuclear charge.

{"id": "atomic/4-14", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the threshold energy for a proton beam to produce the reaction p + p → π⁰ + p + p when the target proton is stationary. Hmm, threshold energy is the minimum kinetic energy required for the reaction to occur. Right, because at threshold, the products are all produced at rest in the center-of-momentum frame. Wait, no, actually, in the center-of-mass frame, at threshold energy, all the products will have zero kinetic energy, meaning they are all at rest. But since the target is stationary in the lab frame, I need to calculate the kinetic energy of the incoming proton such that in the center-of-mass frame, there's enough energy to create the pion plus the rest masses of the protons.\n\nLet me recall the formula for threshold energy. The threshold condition occurs when the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame is equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products. So the total energy in the CM frame must be at least the sum of the rest masses of the two protons and the pion. Then, I need to relate the lab frame kinetic energy to the CM energy.\n\nThe target proton is stationary, so its energy is just its rest energy, m_p c². The incoming proton has kinetic energy K, so its total energy is m_p c² + K. The total energy in the lab frame is then (m_p c² + K) + m_p c² = 2 m_p c² + K. The total momentum in the lab frame is the momentum of the incoming proton, since the target is at rest. The momentum of the incoming proton can be found from its kinetic energy. But maybe it's easier to use conservation of energy and momentum, or use the invariant quantity s = (total energy)² - (total momentum)² c².\n\nRight, the invariant s must be equal in all frames. In the CM frame, the total energy is the sum of the rest masses of the products. So s = (2 m_p + m_π)² c⁴. Then, in the lab frame, s is equal to (E_lab)² - (p_lab c)², where E_lab is the total energy and p_lab is the total momentum.\n\nSo let's write that down. In the lab frame:\n\nE_lab = (K + m_p c²) + m_p c² = K + 2 m_p c²\n\np_lab = momentum of incoming proton = p_p\n\nThe momentum of the incoming proton can be related to its kinetic energy. For a relativistic particle, the total energy is E = γ m_p c², and the momentum is p = γ β m_p c. The kinetic energy K is (γ - 1) m_p c². So we can express γ in terms of K: γ = 1 + K/(m_p c²). Then β = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Hmm, but maybe there's a better way to relate p_p to K.\n\nAlternatively, using the relation E² = (p c)² + (m_p c²)². For the incoming proton, E = m_p c² + K. So:\n\n(m_p c² + K)² = (p_p c)² + (m_p c²)²\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n(m_p c²)² + 2 m_p c² K + K² = (p_p c)² + (m_p c²)²\n\nSubtracting (m_p c²)² from both sides:\n\n2 m_p c² K + K² = (p_p c)²\n\nSo p_p² c² = 2 m_p c² K + K²\n\nTherefore, p_p = sqrt(2 m_p K + K² / c²) / c\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Let's get back to the invariant s.\n\nIn the lab frame, s = (E_lab)^2 - (p_lab c)^2\n\nBut s must also equal (2 m_p + m_π)^2 c^4\n\nSo:\n\n(K + 2 m_p c²)^2 - (p_p c)^2 c² = (2 m_p + m_π)^2 c^4\n\nWait, no. Let me check the units. s has units of energy squared. So in the lab frame, s = [E_lab]^2 - [p_lab c]^2. So:\n\ns = (K + 2 m_p c²)^2 - (p_p c)^2 c² = (2 m_p + m_π)^2 c^4\n\nWait, but p_lab is the total momentum, which is just the momentum of the incoming proton, since the target is at rest. So p_lab = p_p.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(K + 2 m_p c²)^2 - (p_p c)^2 = (2 m_p + m_π)^2 c^4\n\nBut we can express p_p in terms of K. From the earlier equation:\n\np_p^2 c^2 = 2 m_p c^2 K + K^2\n\nSo substituting into the s equation:\n\n(K + 2 m_p c²)^2 - (2 m_p c^2 K + K^2) = (2 m_p + m_π)^2 c^4\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\nFirst, expand (K + 2 m_p c²)^2:\n\n= K² + 4 m_p c² K + 4 m_p² c^4\n\nSubtract (2 m_p c² K + K²):\n\n= K² + 4 m_p c² K + 4 m_p² c^4 - 2 m_p c² K - K²\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe K² terms cancel. 4 m_p c² K - 2 m_p c² K = 2 m_p c² K\n\nSo left side becomes:\n\n2 m_p c² K + 4 m_p² c^4\n\nTherefore:\n\n2 m_p c² K + 4 m_p² c^4 = (2 m_p + m_π)^2 c^4\n\nDivide both sides by c^4:\n\n2 m_p K / c² + 4 m_p² = (2 m_p + m_π)^2\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n2 m_p K / c² = (2 m_p + m_π)^2 - 4 m_p²\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n(2 m_p + m_π)^2 = 4 m_p² + 4 m_p m_π + m_π²\n\nSubtract 4 m_p²:\n\n= 4 m_p m_π + m_π²\n\nTherefore:\n\n2 m_p K / c² = 4 m_p m_π + m_π²\n\nSolve for K:\n\nK = (4 m_p m_π + m_π²) c² / (2 m_p)\n\nFactor out m_π:\n\nK = m_π (4 m_p + m_π) c² / (2 m_p)\n\nSimplify:\n\nK = [ (4 m_p + m_π) / (2 m_p) ] m_π c²\n\n= [ 2 + (m_π)/(2 m_p) ] m_π c²\n\nBut let's compute this numerically. Wait, but maybe we can leave it in terms of masses. Alternatively, since m_π is much smaller than m_p, perhaps we can approximate. But maybe not. Let's see.\n\nThe rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and the rest mass of a neutral pion is about 135 MeV/c². So m_π ≈ 135 MeV/c², m_p ≈ 938 MeV/c².\n\nSo plugging in:\n\nK = [ (4 * 938 + 135 ) / (2 * 938) ] * 135 MeV\n\nFirst compute numerator inside the brackets:\n\n4 * 938 = 3752\n\n3752 + 135 = 3887\n\nDenominator: 2 * 938 = 1876\n\nSo 3887 / 1876 ≈ 2.071\n\nThen multiply by 135 MeV:\n\n2.071 * 135 ≈ 279.6 MeV\n\nSo approximately 280 MeV. But let's check the exact calculation.\n\nWait, let's compute 3887 * 135 / 1876.\n\nFirst, 3887 * 135:\n\n3887 * 100 = 388,700\n\n3887 * 35 = 3887 * 30 + 3887 *5 = 116,610 + 19,435 = 136,045\n\nTotal: 388,700 + 136,045 = 524,745\n\nThen divide by 1876:\n\n524,745 ÷ 1876 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute 1876 * 280 = 1876 * 200 + 1876 *80 = 375,200 + 150,080 = 525,280\n\nBut 524,745 is slightly less than that. So 280 - (525,280 - 524,745)/1876 ≈ 280 - 535/1876 ≈ 280 - 0.285 ≈ 279.715 MeV\n\nSo approximately 279.7 MeV. So the threshold kinetic energy is approximately 280 MeV.\n\nBut let me check the exact formula again. The formula was:\n\nK = [ (4 m_p + m_π) m_π ] / (2 m_p ) c²\n\nWait, but since all masses are in MeV/c², then multiplying by c² gives energy in MeV.\n\nSo K = (4 m_p + m_π) m_π / (2 m_p )\n\nPlugging in m_p = 938, m_π = 135:\n\n(4*938 + 135) = 3752 + 135 = 3887\n\n3887 * 135 = 524,745\n\nDivide by (2*938) = 1876:\n\n524,745 / 1876 ≈ 279.7 MeV\n\nSo yes, approximately 279.7 MeV. Rounding to three significant figures, since m_p is given as ~938 (three sig figs), m_π ~135 (three sig figs), so the answer should be 280 MeV.\n\nBut let me check if there's another approach. Sometimes, the threshold condition can also be calculated by considering that in the center-of-mass frame, all particles are at rest. But since the target is stationary, the calculation might be different. Wait, another way to think about it is that the minimum energy occurs when the final particles are all at rest in the CM frame. Therefore, the total energy in the CM frame must be equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products. Then, the total energy in the lab frame must be such that when transformed to the CM frame, it equals that sum.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for threshold energy in lab frame when target is stationary:\n\nK_min = [(sum M_final)^2 - (sum M_initial)^2]/(2 M_target)\n\nWait, is that a valid formula? Let me recall. For a reaction where a projectile hits a stationary target, the threshold kinetic energy is given by:\n\nK_min = [(Σ m_final)^2 - (m_projectile + m_target)^2]/(2 m_target)\n\nYes, that seems familiar. Let me check.\n\nYes, the formula for the threshold kinetic energy when the target is at rest is:\n\nK_{min} = \\frac{( \\sum m_f )^2 - (m_p + m_t)^2}{2 m_t} c^2\n\nWhere m_p is the projectile mass, m_t is the target mass, and Σ m_f is the sum of the rest masses of the products.\n\nIn this case, the projectile and target are both protons, so m_p = m_t = m_p. The sum of the final masses is 2 m_p + m_π.\n\nTherefore:\n\nK_min = [ (2 m_p + m_π)^2 - (2 m_p)^2 ] / (2 m_p) c²\n\nExpand the numerator:\n\n(4 m_p² + 4 m_p m_π + m_π²) - 4 m_p² = 4 m_p m_π + m_π²\n\nSo:\n\nK_min = (4 m_p m_π + m_π²) / (2 m_p) c²\n\nWhich is the same as before. So this confirms the previous result. Therefore, the threshold kinetic energy is indeed (4 m_p m_π + m_π²)/(2 m_p) c², which simplifies to (2 m_π + m_π²/(2 m_p)) c². But since m_π is much smaller than m_p, the term m_π²/(2 m_p) is negligible compared to 2 m_π. For example, m_π²/(2 m_p) = (135)^2/(2*938) ≈ 18,225 / 1876 ≈ 9.7 MeV, so 2 m_π = 270 MeV, so total is approximately 279.7 MeV, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the threshold kinetic energy is approximately 280 MeV. So the answer should be \\boxed{280 \\text{ MeV}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the threshold energy for the reaction \\( p + p \\rightarrow \\pi^0 + p + p \\) with a stationary proton target, we use the invariant quantity \\( s \\) (Mandelstam variable).

{"id": "atomic/4-36", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the new frequency of an X-ray photon after it scatters off an electron at rest through a 90-degree angle. The initial frequency is given as 3×10¹⁹ Hz, and the electron's Compton wavelength is 2.4×10⁻¹² meters. Hmm, let me recall what I know about the Compton effect.\n\nRight, the Compton effect describes the change in wavelength (and thus frequency) of a photon when it scatters off a free electron. The formula for the change in wavelength is Δλ = λ_c (1 - cosθ), where λ_c is the Compton wavelength of the electron, and θ is the scattering angle. Since the photon loses some energy to the electron, its wavelength increases, which means the frequency decreases. \n\nFirst, I need to convert the initial frequency to wavelength using the relation c = λν. So the initial wavelength λ_initial = c / ν_initial. Then, after scattering, the new wavelength λ' = λ_initial + Δλ. Once I have the new wavelength, I can find the new frequency ν' using c = λ' ν', so ν' = c / λ'.\n\nLet me write down the steps:\n\n1. Calculate initial wavelength: λ_initial = c / ν_initial.\n2. Compute the change in wavelength: Δλ = λ_c (1 - cosθ).\n3. Find the new wavelength: λ' = λ_initial + Δλ.\n4. Convert back to frequency: ν' = c / λ'.\n\nGiven that θ is 90 degrees, cosθ is cos(90°) which is 0. So Δλ = λ_c (1 - 0) = λ_c. Therefore, Δλ is just the Compton wavelength here. That simplifies things.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. The speed of light c is approximately 3×10⁸ m/s. The initial frequency ν_initial is 3×10¹⁹ Hz. So λ_initial = (3×10⁸ m/s) / (3×10¹⁹ Hz) = 1×10⁻¹¹ meters. Wait, 3e8 divided by 3e19 is 1e-11. That seems right.\n\nThen, the change in wavelength Δλ is λ_c = 2.4×10⁻¹² meters. So the new wavelength λ' = 1e-11 m + 2.4e-12 m = 1.24e-11 meters. Wait, adding 1e-11 and 2.4e-12: 1e-11 is 10e-12, so 10e-12 + 2.4e-12 = 12.4e-12 m = 1.24e-11 m.\n\nNow, converting back to frequency: ν' = c / λ' = (3e8 m/s) / (1.24e-11 m) ≈ 3e8 / 1.24e-11 ≈ (3 / 1.24) × 10¹⁹. Let me compute 3 divided by 1.24. 1.24 × 2 = 2.48, which is less than 3. 3 - 2.48 = 0.52. So 2 + 0.52/1.24 ≈ 2 + 0.419 ≈ 2.419. So approximately 2.419 × 10¹⁹ Hz.\n\nWait, let me do that division more accurately. 3 divided by 1.24. Let's see:\n\n1.24 × 2.4 = 1.24*2 + 1.24*0.4 = 2.48 + 0.496 = 2.976. That's close to 3. So 2.4 + (3 - 2.976)/1.24. The difference is 0.024. 0.024 / 1.24 ≈ 0.01935. So total is approximately 2.4 + 0.01935 ≈ 2.41935. So 2.41935 × 10¹⁹ Hz. Rounding to two decimal places, maybe 2.42 × 10¹⁹ Hz. But maybe I should keep more decimals for accuracy.\n\nAlternatively, using calculator steps:\n\n3 / 1.24 = 2.4193548387... So approximately 2.41935e19 Hz. So the new frequency is approximately 2.419 × 10¹⁹ Hz. Let me check the calculation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, initial wavelength: c / ν_initial = 3e8 / 3e19 = 1e-11 m. Correct. Then Δλ = 2.4e-12 m. So new wavelength is 1e-11 + 2.4e-12 = 1.24e-11 m. Then ν' = 3e8 / 1.24e-11. Let's compute that:\n\n3e8 divided by 1.24e-11 is (3 / 1.24) × 10^(8 + 11) = 2.41935 × 10¹⁹ Hz. Yes, that's correct. So the new frequency is approximately 2.42 × 10¹⁹ Hz. But maybe the exact value is needed. Let me check if there's a way to express it more precisely. Alternatively, perhaps using fractions. But the problem gives the Compton wavelength as 2.4e-12, which is probably an approximate value, so the answer should be given to two significant figures? Let's see: the given values are 3e19 Hz (one significant figure?) Wait, 3 × 10¹⁹ Hz is one significant figure, and the Compton wavelength is 2.4 × 10⁻¹² (two significant figures). So when multiplying or dividing, the result should have the least number of significant figures. Here, the calculation involves division (3 / 1.24) which is two significant figures (since 1.24 is from 2.4e-12, which is two sig figs). Wait, actually, the Compton wavelength is given as 2.4e-12 (two sig figs), and the initial frequency is 3e19 (one sig fig). Hmm, so when we compute the new frequency, the precision would be limited by the least number of sig figs. But since the initial frequency is 3e19 (one sig fig), but the Compton wavelength is 2.4e-12 (two sig figs). The angle is 90 degrees, which is exact. So the answer should probably be given to two significant figures because the Compton wavelength has two. Wait, but the initial frequency is given as 3e19, which is one sig fig. That complicates things. However, in physics problems, sometimes the numbers are considered exact. For example, 3×10¹⁹ might be an exact value here. But maybe the answer should be given to two significant figures because the Compton wavelength is given to two. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects an exact formula. Let me think. The formula for the shift is Δλ = λ_c (1 - cosθ). Then, the new wavelength is λ' = λ_initial + Δλ. Then, the new frequency is ν' = c / (λ_initial + λ_c (1 - cosθ)). Since θ is 90 degrees, cosθ is 0, so Δλ = λ_c. Therefore, ν' = c / (c/ν_initial + λ_c). Let me write that as ν' = 1 / (1/ν_initial + λ_c / c). Let me compute λ_c / c. λ_c is 2.4e-12 m. c is 3e8 m/s. So λ_c / c = 2.4e-12 / 3e8 = 0.8e-20 = 8e-21 seconds. Then, 1/ν_initial is 1/(3e19) ≈ 3.333e-20 seconds. So total denominator is 3.333e-20 + 8e-21 = 4.1333e-20 seconds. Then, ν' = 1 / 4.1333e-20 ≈ 2.419e19 Hz. So approximately 2.42e19 Hz. If we use exact fractions, maybe:\n\nLet me compute 1/( (1/(3e19)) + (2.4e-12)/(3e8) )\n\nFirst term: 1/(3e19) = 1/(3)*1e-19 = 0.333...e-19 = 3.333...e-20 s\n\nSecond term: (2.4e-12)/(3e8) = (2.4/3)*1e-20 = 0.8e-20 = 8e-21 s\n\nAdding them: 3.333e-20 + 0.8e-20 = 4.133e-20 s\n\nThen, 1 / 4.133e-20 ≈ 2.419e19 Hz. So 2.42e19 Hz when rounded to three significant figures. But given that the initial frequency has one sig fig and Compton wavelength two, perhaps the answer should be given to two significant figures. So 2.4e19 Hz. Wait, but 3e19 is one sig fig, so the answer would be 2e19? Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem gives the initial frequency as 3 × 10¹⁹ Hz (one sig fig), Compton wavelength as 2.4 × 10⁻¹² m (two sig figs). The angle is 90 degrees, which is exact. When combining these, the number of significant figures in the result is determined by the least precise measurement. However, in this case, the initial frequency is 3e19 (one sig fig), which would suggest that the answer should be given to one sig fig. But that seems too rough. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the given values as exact and present the answer with the same number of decimal places as the given data. Since the answer comes out to approximately 2.419e19, which is 2.42e19 when rounded to three sig figs, but given the input has 3e19 (maybe considered as one sig fig, but sometimes in such problems, numbers like 3e19 are considered as precise if they are given without more decimal places). Hmm. Maybe the answer is expected to be 2.4 × 10¹⁹ Hz, which is two sig figs, matching the Compton wavelength. Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation is needed. Let me check with the exact numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the use of the formula without approximating. Let me re-express the formula:\n\nν' = c / ( (c/ν_initial) + λ_c (1 - cosθ) )\n\nSince θ = 90°, cosθ = 0, so:\n\nν' = c / ( (c/ν_initial) + λ_c )\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by ν_initial:\n\nν' = (c ν_initial) / (c + ν_initial λ_c )\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nν_initial = 3e19 Hz\n\nλ_c = 2.4e-12 m\n\nSo numerator: 3e8 * 3e19 = 9e27\n\nDenominator: 3e8 + 3e19 * 2.4e-12\n\nCompute 3e19 * 2.4e-12 = 7.2e7\n\nSo denominator: 3e8 + 7.2e7 = 3e8 + 0.72e8 = 3.72e8\n\nTherefore, ν' = 9e27 / 3.72e8 ≈ (9 / 3.72) × 10^(27-8) ≈ 2.419e19 Hz. So same result as before. So approximately 2.42e19 Hz. If we use exact division, 9 / 3.72 = 2.41935... So 2.41935e19 Hz. Depending on the problem's requirement for significant figures, but since the given data has 3e19 (1 sig fig) and 2.4e-12 (2 sig figs), the answer should probably be given to two significant figures. So 2.4e19 Hz. But wait, 2.419 is closer to 2.4 than 2.5 when rounding to two sig figs. So 2.4e19 Hz. However, if the problem allows three sig figs, then 2.42e19. But given the initial frequency is 3e19 (1 sig fig), but the Compton wavelength is 2.4e-12 (two sig figs). The rule is that the result should be stated with the same number of significant figures as the least precise measurement. However, in this case, the calculation involves both addition and division. Wait, the formula is ν' = c / ( (c/ν_initial) + λ_c ). The term (c/ν_initial) is 1e-11 m, and λ_c is 2.4e-12 m. So when adding these two, 1e-11 + 2.4e-12 = 1.24e-11 m. The precision here is two decimal places in the second term, but since 1e-11 is 10e-12, adding 2.4e-12 gives 12.4e-12, which is two sig figs (since 2.4 is two sig figs). So the sum is 1.24e-11 m, which is three sig figs? Wait, 12.4e-12 is three sig figs? Wait, 12.4 has three significant figures. But the original terms: 1e-11 (which is 10e-12) is one sig fig, and 2.4e-12 is two sig figs. When adding, the result's precision is to the least decimal place. 10e-12 is 1.0e-11, which has uncertainty in the tenths place (since it's one sig fig), and 2.4e-12 is known to the hundredths place (two sig figs). So when added, the result is 12.4e-12, but the first term's uncertainty is larger. The tenths place in 1.0e-11 is uncertain, so the sum would be 1.2e-11 (two sig figs). Wait, maybe. Let me recall the rules for addition. When adding, the result has the same number of decimal places as the term with the least decimal places. But in scientific notation, it's about the exponent. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Since in the problem, the answer is likely expected to be given as 2.4 × 10¹⁹ Hz, considering the Compton wavelength has two sig figs. Alternatively, the problem might not care about sig figs and just wants the exact calculation. Since in the calculation we got approximately 2.42 × 10¹⁹ Hz, but let me check with exact fractions.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute 9e27 / 3.72e8:\n\n9e27 / 3.72e8 = (9 / 3.72) × 10^(27-8) = (2.4193548...) × 10¹⁹ Hz. So approximately 2.42 × 10¹⁹ Hz. If the problem expects the answer in two decimal places or something, but likely, given the options, the answer is 2.4 × 10¹⁹ Hz. But wait, 2.419 is closer to 2.4 than to 2.5 when rounding to two sig figs. Wait, 2.419 with two sig figs would be 2.4. If it were three sig figs, it's 2.42. Since the Compton wavelength is given to two sig figs, and the initial frequency to one, the answer should have one sig fig? Wait, no. The rule is that when multiplying or dividing, the number of sig figs is the smallest number of sig figs in the factors. But here, the formula involves both division and addition. The addition step (adding wavelengths) would affect the precision. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial wavelength is c / ν_initial = 3e8 / 3e19 = 1e-11 m (one sig fig). The Compton shift is 2.4e-12 m (two sig figs). Adding them: 1e-11 + 2.4e-12 = 1.24e-11 m. The first term has one sig fig, the second has two. When adding, the result is only as precise as the least precise term. The first term is 1e-11 (which could be 1.0e-11 ± 0.5e-11), and the second term is 2.4e-12 ± 0.05e-12. So the sum is 1.24e-11, but the uncertainty is dominated by the first term's uncertainty. So the sum is 1.2e-11 ± 0.5e-11. Wait, that's a large uncertainty. But in reality, if the initial frequency is given as 3e19 Hz (one sig fig), then the initial wavelength is 1e-11 m with one sig fig, meaning it's between 0.5e-11 and 1.5e-11. Adding 2.4e-12 (which is 0.24e-11) gives a wavelength between 0.74e-11 and 1.74e-11. Then, the frequency would be between 3e8 / 1.74e-11 ≈ 1.72e19 Hz and 3e8 / 0.74e-11 ≈ 4.05e19 Hz. That's a huge range. But since the problem gives specific numbers without uncertainties, we have to proceed with the given values as exact. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.419e19 Hz, which can be written as 2.42e19 Hz with three sig figs or 2.4e19 with two. Given that the Compton wavelength is given to two sig figs, and the initial frequency to one, but the calculation involves both, perhaps the answer should be given to two sig figs. So 2.4 × 10¹⁹ Hz. However, in many textbooks, Compton effect problems often expect the answer to be expressed with the same number of decimal places as the given data, which here would be two sig figs from the Compton wavelength. So I think the answer is 2.4 × 10¹⁹ Hz. But let me check with the exact calculation again. If I use exact values:\n\nν' = c / ( (c/ν_initial) + λ_c )\n\nPlugging in:\n\nc = 3 × 10⁸ m/s\n\nν_initial = 3 × 10¹⁹ Hz\n\nλ_c = 2.4 × 10⁻¹² m\n\nCompute denominator:\n\n(c / ν_initial) = (3e8) / (3e19) = 1e-11 m\n\nλ_c = 2.4e-12 m\n\nSum: 1e-11 + 2.4e-12 = 1.24e-11 m\n\nν' = 3e8 / 1.24e-11 = (3 / 1.24) × 10¹⁹ ≈ 2.419e19 Hz\n\nSo the precise answer is approximately 2.419 × 10¹⁹ Hz. Depending on the problem's requirement, but since the given data has two significant figures in the Compton wavelength, and the initial frequency is one, but the calculation leads to a number that has three digits, maybe the answer should be 2.4 × 10¹⁹ Hz. However, in many cases, especially in physics problems, even if some data has fewer sig figs, intermediate steps can retain more digits, and the final answer is given with appropriate sig figs. Here, since the dominant term in the denominator after the addition is the initial wavelength (1e-11) which is one sig fig, but the Compton shift adds a term with two sig figs. However, the sum is 1.24e-11, which is three digits, but the first term has one sig fig. This is a bit ambiguous. To avoid under or over-reporting, perhaps the answer should be given as 2.4 × 10¹⁹ Hz, two sig figs. Alternatively, if the problem expects more precision, 2.42 × 10¹⁹ Hz. But given that the initial frequency is 3e19 (one sig fig), but the Compton wavelength is 2.4e-12 (two sig figs), the answer should probably be given to two sig figs. So 2.4 × 10¹⁹ Hz. However, when I compute it, it's 2.419e19, which is 2.42e19 when rounded to three sig figs. But since the Compton wavelength has two, maybe two sig figs. Hmm. I think the safest answer here is to present it as 2.4 × 10¹⁹ Hz, but I need to check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the exact answer is expected. Let me see. If I use exact fractions:\n\n3 / 1.24 = 300 / 124 = 75 / 31 ≈ 2.41935. So 2.41935e19 Hz. If the problem doesn't specify sig figs, then this is the answer. But since the problem gives the Compton wavelength as 2.4e-12 (two sig figs), and the initial frequency as 3e19 (one sig fig), the answer should have one sig fig. Wait, no. When multiplying or dividing, the number of sig figs is determined by the least number of sig figs in the factors. Here, in the final step, we have 3e8 (one sig fig) divided by 1.24e-11 (three sig figs? Wait, 1.24e-11 is three sig figs: 1, 2, 4). But how did we get 1.24e-11? By adding 1e-11 (one sig fig) and 2.4e-12 (two sig figs). When adding, the result's precision is to the least decimal place. Let's express them in the same exponent:\n\n1e-11 m = 10e-12 m\n\n2.4e-12 m\n\nAdding: 10e-12 + 2.4e-12 = 12.4e-12 m = 1.24e-11 m\n\nThe first term, 10e-12, has one sig fig (the '1' in 10), and the second term, 2.4e-12, has two. When adding, the result is 12.4e-12, but the first term's uncertainty is ±5e-12 (since 10e-12 with one sig fig is 1e-11, which could be from 0.5e-11 to 1.5e-11). So the sum is 12.4e-12, but with an uncertainty that makes it 12.4e-12 ±5e-12. That's a large uncertainty. However, in the problem, we are to assume the given values are exact. Therefore, the sum is exactly 1.24e-11 m, and the calculation proceeds with that. Therefore, the answer is 2.419e19 Hz, which can be written as 2.42e19 Hz with three sig figs. But since the initial frequency is given with one sig fig, but the Compton wavelength with two, perhaps the answer should be two sig figs. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check an example. Suppose you have a similar problem where initial frequency is 1e20 Hz (one sig fig) and Compton wavelength 2.43e-12 (three sig figs), then the answer would be calculated with more precision but reported with one sig fig. However, in this case, the initial frequency is 3e19 (one sig fig), and the Compton wavelength is 2.4e-12 (two sig figs). The calculation involves both. The rule is that the number of significant figures in the result should match the least number in the inputs for multiplication/division steps. However, here, the formula involves addition and division. The addition step (wavelengths) has two terms with different sig figs, but once added, the division step (c divided by the sum) would have the sum's precision. But since the sum is 1.24e-11 m (three sig figs?), but derived from terms with one and two sig figs, the sum's precision is ambiguous. However, if we take the sum as exact (1.24e-11), then the division by c (which is exact, assuming c is a defined constant with infinite sig figs) would give a result with three sig figs. But since the initial frequency is given with one sig fig, maybe the answer should be one sig fig. But that would be 2e19 Hz, which is a rough approximation. But our calculation gives 2.42e19, which is much closer to 2.4e19 than 2e19. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the problem expects the answer as 2.4 × 10¹⁹ Hz, considering the Compton wavelength's two sig figs. Alternatively, the problem might not care about sig figs and just wants the precise value. Since the problem states \"Find the new frequency of the X-ray,\" without specifying sig figs, I think the precise value is expected. Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.42 × 10¹⁹ Hz. But let me check with the exact calculation once more:\n\nν' = 3e8 / (1.24e-11) = 3e8 / 1.24e-11 = (3 / 1.24) × 10¹⁹ ≈ 2.419e19 Hz. So 2.42 × 10¹⁹ Hz when rounded to three significant figures. Given that the Compton wavelength is given to two, but the calculation involves three, perhaps the answer should be 2.4 × 10¹⁹ Hz. However, in most textbooks, when solving such problems, they often retain the decimals until the end and round to the least number of sig figs. Here, the least is one (initial frequency), but that seems too rough. Alternatively, since the Compton wavelength is given to two, and the angle is exact, the answer should be two sig figs. Therefore, 2.4 × 10¹⁹ Hz. But my calculation gives 2.419e19, which is 2.4e19 when rounded to two sig figs. Yes. So the final answer is 2.4 × 10¹⁹ Hz.\n</think>\n\nThe new frequency of the X-ray photon after scattering can be found using the Compton effect formula.

{"id": "atomic/4-31", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I have these two physics problems here, part (a) and part (b). Let me start with part (a). The question is about finding the threshold kinetic energy for the reaction where a K- meson collides with a proton at rest to produce an Omega- particle, a K+ meson, and a K0 meson. The threshold kinetic energy is the minimum energy needed for this reaction to occur. \n\nHmm, threshold conditions in particle physics usually mean that all the resulting particles are produced at rest in the center-of-momentum frame. Wait, no, actually, threshold occurs when the kinetic energy is just enough so that all the products are created with zero kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame. That is, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame must equal the sum of the rest masses of the products. But since the proton is initially at rest, the problem is in the lab frame. So I need to calculate the minimum kinetic energy of the incoming K- such that the reaction can happen.\n\nLet me recall the formula for threshold energy. The threshold kinetic energy for a reaction where a projectile hits a target at rest is given by:\n\nK_th = [(sum of rest masses of products)^2 - (mass of projectile + mass of target)^2]/(2 * mass of target)\n\nWait, let me check that. The general formula when the target is at rest is:\n\nK_th = [(Σm_final)^2 - (m_projectile + m_target)^2]/(2 m_target)\n\nYes, that seems right. Because in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy squared is (Σm_final c²)^2, and in the lab frame, the total energy is the sum of the projectile's energy (including kinetic) and the target's rest energy. Then using conservation of energy and momentum, you can derive the threshold condition. Let me verify this.\n\nThe total energy in the lab frame is E_lab = K + m_K c² + m_p c², where K is the kinetic energy of the K-. The total momentum is p_lab = sqrt((K + m_K c²)^2 - (m_K c²)^2)/c. Wait, maybe better to use relativistic energy-momentum relations.\n\nThe threshold condition occurs when the final particles are all at rest in the center-of-mass frame. Therefore, the total energy in the lab frame must be equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, the threshold condition can be found by considering that in the center-of-mass frame, the kinetic energy is just enough to create the particles at rest. So the total invariant mass squared must be equal to (Σm_final c²)^2. The invariant mass squared is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. \n\nIn the lab frame, the target proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c², and the incoming K- has energy E_K = K + m_K c². The total energy is E_total = E_K + m_p c², and the total momentum is p_total = p_K = sqrt(E_K² - m_K² c^4)/c² * c. Wait, maybe better to write in terms of E and p.\n\nSo the invariant mass squared s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. At threshold, s must equal (Σm_final)^2 c^4. So:\n\n(E_K + m_p c²)^2 - (p_K c)^2 = (m_Ω + m_K+ + m_K0)^2 c^4\n\nBut E_K is the total energy of the K-, which is K + m_K c². And p_K is the momentum of the K-, which is sqrt(E_K² - m_K² c^4)/c. So substituting:\n\n[ (K + m_K c² + m_p c²) ]^2 - [ sqrt( (K + m_K c²)^2 - m_K^2 c^4 ) ]^2 c^2 = (m_Ω + m_K+ + m_K0)^2 c^4\n\nSimplify the left-hand side:\n\nFirst term: (K + m_K c² + m_p c²)^2\n\nSecond term: [ (K + m_K c²)^2 - m_K^2 c^4 ] c^2 / c^2 = (K + m_K c²)^2 - m_K^2 c^4\n\nWait, no. Wait, the momentum squared times c squared is (p_K c)^2 = (E_K^2 - m_K^2 c^4) where E_K = K + m_K c². So (p_K c)^2 = (K + m_K c²)^2 - m_K^2 c^4.\n\nTherefore, the left-hand side becomes:\n\n(E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2 = (K + m_K c² + m_p c²)^2 - [ (K + m_K c²)^2 - m_K^2 c^4 ]\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= [ (K + m_K c²)^2 + 2 (K + m_K c²)(m_p c²) + (m_p c²)^2 ] - (K + m_K c²)^2 + m_K^2 c^4\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: (K + m_K c²)^2 cancels with the third term's -(K + m_K c²)^2.\n\nSo remaining terms:\n\n2 (K + m_K c²)(m_p c²) + (m_p c²)^2 + m_K^2 c^4\n\nSo the left-hand side simplifies to:\n\n2 m_p c² (K + m_K c²) + m_p² c^4 + m_K² c^4\n\nSet this equal to (m_Ω + m_K+ + m_K0)^2 c^4.\n\nSo:\n\n2 m_p c² (K + m_K c²) + m_p² c^4 + m_K² c^4 = (m_Ω + m_K+ + m_K0)^2 c^4\n\nLet me divide both sides by c^4 to make it cleaner:\n\n2 m_p (K + m_K c²)/c² + m_p² + m_K² = (m_Ω + m_K+ + m_K0)^2\n\nWait, but K is the kinetic energy, which is (gamma - 1) m_K c². Wait, but maybe better to express K in terms of energy. Wait, K is the kinetic energy of the incoming K-, so K = (gamma - 1) m_K c². But perhaps it's easier to solve for K directly.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\n2 m_p (K + m_K c²)/c² = (m_Ω + m_K+ + m_K0)^2 - m_p² - m_K²\n\nMultiply both sides by c²/(2 m_p):\n\nK + m_K c² = [ (m_Ω + m_K+ + m_K0)^2 - m_p² - m_K² ] c²/(2 m_p)\n\nThen subtract m_K c² to get K:\n\nK = [ (m_Ω + m_K+ + m_K0)^2 - m_p² - m_K² ] c²/(2 m_p) - m_K c²\n\nFactor out c²:\n\nK = [ (m_Ω + m_K+ + m_K0)^2 - (m_p + m_K)^2 ] c²/(2 m_p )\n\nWait, because (m_Ω + m_K+ + m_K0)^2 - m_p² - m_K² = (sum)^2 - (m_p + m_K)^2 + 2 m_p m_K - m_p² - m_K²? Wait, maybe not. Let me check:\n\nWait, (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². So (sum)^2 - (m_p + m_K)^2 = [sum]^2 - m_p² - 2 m_p m_K - m_K². But in our previous equation, we have (sum)^2 - m_p² - m_K². So the difference between that and (sum)^2 - (m_p + m_K)^2 is 2 m_p m_K. Therefore, perhaps we can write:\n\n[ (sum)^2 - m_p² - m_K² ] = [ (sum)^2 - (m_p + m_K)^2 + 2 m_p m_K ]\n\nBut maybe not necessary. Let's just proceed.\n\nSo K = [ (sum)^2 - m_p² - m_K² ] c²/(2 m_p ) - m_K c²\n\nBut let's combine the terms:\n\nK = [ (sum)^2 - m_p² - m_K² - 2 m_p m_K ] c²/(2 m_p )\n\nBecause:\n\n[ (sum)^2 - m_p² - m_K² ] / (2 m_p ) - m_K = [ (sum)^2 - m_p² - m_K² - 2 m_p m_K ] / (2 m_p )\n\nYes, because:\n\n[ A - B ] / (2 m_p ) - m_K = [ A - B - 2 m_p m_K ] / (2 m_p )\n\nSo indeed, K = [ (sum)^2 - (m_p + m_K)^2 ] c²/(2 m_p )\n\nTherefore, the threshold kinetic energy is:\n\nK_th = [ (m_Ω + m_K+ + m_K0 )² - (m_p + m_K^- )² ] c² / (2 m_p )\n\nAssuming that the K- is the projectile. So that's the formula. So part (a) answer is that.\n\nNow moving to part (b). The problem states that a K0 travels at a speed of 0.8c and decays into two neutral pions. We need to find the maximum angle (in the lab frame) that the pions can make with the K0's line of flight. The maximum angle occurs when one of the pions is emitted perpendicular to the direction of motion in the rest frame of the K0, but when boosted to the lab frame, this angle gets transformed. Alternatively, the maximum angle in the lab frame can be found by considering the velocity addition or using relativistic transformations of angles.\n\nLet me recall that when a particle decays into two particles, the maximum angle of emission in the lab frame (where the parent particle is moving) can be found by considering the decay in the rest frame and then boosting to the lab frame. The maximum angle occurs when the decay products are emitted perpendicularly in the rest frame, but when boosted, their direction gets \"dragged\" forward, but there's a maximum possible angle.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum angle can be found using the formula involving the velocities. The formula for the maximum angle θ_max is given by sinθ_max = (v'_perp / (γ(v)(v_parent + v'_parallel ))), but I need to think carefully.\n\nAlternatively, using the relation between angles in the rest frame and the lab frame. Let me denote the rest frame of the K0 as S', moving with velocity v = 0.8c relative to the lab frame S. In the rest frame S', the two pions are emitted in opposite directions with some angles. To find the maximum angle in the lab frame, we can consider one pion emitted at angle θ' in S', then transform to S.\n\nThe angle in the lab frame θ is given by:\n\ntanθ = (v'_y ) / [ γ(v) (v'_x + v) ]\n\nWhere v'_x and v'_y are the components of the pion's velocity in S'. The maximum angle occurs when the pion is emitted perpendicularly in S', i.e., v'_x = 0, v'_y = u', where u' is the speed of the pion in S'. But wait, in the rest frame of the K0, the two pions must have equal and opposite momenta. So each pion has speed u' in opposite directions. Let's suppose in the rest frame, each pion has speed u', and let's compute u'.\n\nThe rest mass of K0 is m_K, and it decays into two π0. The rest mass of π0 is m_π. So energy conservation in the rest frame gives:\n\nm_K c² = 2 γ(u') m_π c²\n\nTherefore, γ(u') = m_K / (2 m_π )\n\nSo γ(u') = 1 / sqrt(1 - (u'^2/c^2)) = m_K/(2 m_π )\n\nSolving for u':\n\nsqrt(1 - (u'^2/c^2)) = 2 m_π / m_K\n\n1 - (u'^2/c^2) = (4 m_π²)/(m_K²)\n\nThus,\n\nu'^2/c^2 = 1 - (4 m_π²)/(m_K²)\n\nTherefore,\n\nu' = c sqrt(1 - (4 m_π²)/(m_K²))\n\nBut this requires that m_K ≥ 2 m_π, which is true because the K0 mass is about 498 MeV/c² and the π0 is about 135 MeV/c², so 2 m_π is ~270 MeV/c², so yes.\n\nSo the speed of each pion in the K0 rest frame is u' = c sqrt(1 - (4 m_π²/m_K²)).\n\nNow, in the rest frame S', the pion can be emitted at angle θ' relative to the direction of motion (which is the direction of the K0 in the lab frame). To find the maximum angle in the lab frame, we need to find the emission angle θ in the lab frame as a function of θ' and then maximize θ.\n\nBut the maximum angle occurs when the pion is emitted perpendicularly in the S' frame, i.e., θ' = 90 degrees. Because when you boost, the forward direction gets contracted, so the maximum angle would be when the emission is sideways in the rest frame.\n\nWait, but let's check. Suppose in S', the pion is emitted at θ' = 90 degrees, so its velocity components are (0, u'). When we boost to the lab frame (which is moving at velocity -v = -0.8c relative to S'), the velocity components in the lab frame can be found using Lorentz transformations.\n\nThe Lorentz transformations for velocity are:\n\nu_x = (u'_x + v)/(1 + (u'_x v)/c² )\n\nu_y = (u'_y )/(γ (1 + (u'_x v)/c² ))\n\nIn this case, u'_x = 0, u'_y = u'\n\nSo,\n\nu_x = v / (1 + 0 ) = v = 0.8c\n\nu_y = u' / γ (1 + 0 ) = u' / γ\n\nWhere γ is the Lorentz factor of the K0 in the lab frame, which is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64) = 1 / sqrt(0.36) = 1/0.6 ≈ 5/3 ≈ 1.6667.\n\nSo u_y = u' / γ\n\nTherefore, the angle θ in the lab frame is given by tanθ = u_y / u_x = (u'/(γ v )) = (u')/(γ v )\n\nBut u' is the speed in the rest frame, which we found earlier as u' = c sqrt(1 - (4 m_π²/m_K²))\n\nTherefore,\n\ntanθ_max = [ c sqrt(1 - (4 m_π²/m_K²)) ] / ( γ v )\n\nBut v = 0.8c, so substituting:\n\ntanθ_max = [ sqrt(1 - (4 m_π²/m_K²)) ] / ( γ * 0.8 )\n\nSince γ = 5/3, then:\n\ntanθ_max = sqrt(1 - (4 m_π²/m_K²)) / ( (5/3)*0.8 ) ) = sqrt(1 - (4 m_π²/m_K²)) / (4/3 )\n\nSimplify:\n\ntanθ_max = (3/4) sqrt(1 - (4 m_π²/m_K²))\n\nTherefore, θ_max = arctan [ (3/4) sqrt(1 - (4 m_π²/m_K²)) ]\n\nBut the problem asks to express the answer in terms of the π and K masses. So we can write this as:\n\nθ_max = arctan( (3/4) sqrt(1 - (4 m_π^2)/(m_K^2)) )\n\nAlternatively, perhaps simplifying the expression inside the square root:\n\n1 - (4 m_π²/m_K²) = (m_K² - 4 m_π²)/m_K²\n\nSo sqrt( (m_K² - 4 m_π²)/m_K² ) = sqrt(m_K² - 4 m_π²)/m_K\n\nTherefore,\n\ntanθ_max = (3/4) * sqrt(m_K² - 4 m_π²)/m_K = (3/(4 m_K)) sqrt(m_K² - 4 m_π²)\n\nBut maybe it's better to leave it in terms of the original expression. So the maximum angle is arctangent of (3/4) times sqrt(1 - 4 m_π²/m_K²). Therefore, the answer is θ_max = arctan[ (3/4) sqrt(1 - (4 m_π²)/(m_K²)) ]\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach. Let me check.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use the formula for the maximum angle in a two-body decay when the parent is moving. The maximum angle occurs when the decay product is emitted at the critical angle in the lab frame. The formula for the maximum angle can be derived by considering the decay in the rest frame and then boosting.\n\nIn the rest frame S', the pion can be emitted in any direction, but when we boost to the lab frame, the angle θ in the lab is related to the angle θ' in the rest frame by:\n\ntanθ = (sinθ') / [ γ (cosθ' + v/u') ]\n\nWhere v is the velocity of the parent (K0) in the lab frame, and u' is the speed of the pion in the rest frame.\n\nTo find the maximum θ, we can take the derivative of tanθ with respect to θ' and set it to zero. However, this might be complicated. Alternatively, the maximum angle occurs when the denominator is minimized, but I need to think.\n\nAlternatively, using the relation:\n\ntanθ = (u' sinθ') / [ γ (u' cosθ' + v) ]\n\nTo maximize θ, we need to maximize tanθ. Let's treat this as a function of θ' and find its maximum.\n\nLet’s set f(θ') = (sinθ') / [ γ (cosθ' + v/u') ]\n\nWe can find the maximum by taking derivative df/dθ' = 0.\n\nLet’s compute derivative:\n\ndf/dθ' = [ cosθ' * γ (cosθ' + v/u') - sinθ' * γ (-sinθ') ] / [ γ^2 (cosθ' + v/u')^2 ]\n\nSet numerator to zero:\n\ncosθ' (cosθ' + v/u') + sin²θ' = 0\n\nExpand:\n\ncos²θ' + (v/u') cosθ' + sin²θ' = 0\n\nBut cos²θ' + sin²θ' = 1, so:\n\n1 + (v/u') cosθ' = 0\n\nTherefore,\n\ncosθ' = - u'/(v )\n\nBut cosθ' must be between -1 and 1. Therefore, this equation can only be satisfied if |u'/v| ≤ 1. However, in our case, u' is the speed of the pion in the K0 rest frame. Let's compute u':\n\nFrom earlier, u' = c sqrt(1 - (4 m_π²/m_K²))\n\nBut the velocity v of the K0 is 0.8c. So u'/v = sqrt(1 - 4 m_π²/m_K²) / 0.8\n\nFor the equation cosθ' = -u'/v to have a solution, we need |u'/v| ≤ 1. So sqrt(1 - 4 m_π²/m_K²) ≤ 0.8\n\nBut given that m_K is much larger than 2 m_π (as K0 is ~500 MeV, π0 ~135 MeV), sqrt(1 - 4 m_π²/m_K²) is sqrt(1 - (4*135²)/(500²)) ≈ sqrt(1 - (4*18225)/250000) ≈ sqrt(1 - 72900/250000) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.2916) ≈ sqrt(0.7084) ≈ 0.8417, which is greater than 0.8. Therefore, u'/v ≈ 0.8417 / 0.8 ≈ 1.052, which is greater than 1. Therefore, cosθ' = -u'/v would be less than -1, which is impossible. Therefore, there is no solution, meaning that the maximum of tanθ occurs at the boundary.\n\nTherefore, the maximum angle occurs when θ' is such that the pion is emitted backwards in the rest frame, but when boosted, the angle is maximized. Alternatively, the maximum possible angle is when the pion is emitted perpendicularly in the rest frame, which we considered earlier.\n\nWait, but earlier when we considered θ' = 90 degrees, we found tanθ = (u' / γ v ). But if u'/v > 1/γ, then this angle is possible. Let's compute:\n\nGiven that u' ≈ 0.8417c, v =0.8c, γ =5/3≈1.6667.\n\nThen u'/(γ v ) ≈ (0.8417c)/(1.6667 *0.8c ) ≈ 0.8417/(1.3333) ≈0.6313. So tanθ ≈0.6313, which gives θ≈32.3 degrees. But if we can get a larger angle by choosing a different θ', perhaps?\n\nBut according to the earlier analysis, since the equation for the maximum leads to cosθ' = -u'/v which is not possible (as u'/v >1), the maximum occurs at the boundary when θ'=180 degrees (emitted directly opposite to the motion in the rest frame). Let's check that.\n\nIf θ'=180 degrees, then in S', the pion is moving in the -x direction with speed u'. Then in the lab frame, its velocity components would be:\n\nu_x = ( -u' + v ) / (1 + (-u') v /c² )\n\nu_y =0.\n\nSo the angle is 180 degrees, but when boosted, it might be less. Wait, but if the pion is emitted opposite to the K0's motion in its rest frame, then in the lab frame, depending on the speed, it could be moving forward or backward.\n\nThe x-component of velocity in the lab frame is:\n\nu_x = ( -u' + v ) / (1 - u' v /c² )\n\nIf (-u' + v ) is positive, then the pion is moving forward, otherwise backward. Given that v=0.8c and u'≈0.8417c, then -u' +v ≈ -0.8417c +0.8c≈-0.0417c, which is negative. Therefore, the pion would be moving backward in the lab frame. The angle would be 180 degrees, which is not the maximum angle but the minimum. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum angle occurs when the pion is emitted at some θ' where the resulting angle in the lab is maximized. Since the earlier approach when θ'=90 degrees gives a certain angle, but if we can't achieve a higher angle by choosing another θ', then that is the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the maximum angle in terms of the velocities. The maximum possible angle is given by sinθ_max = u' / (γ v ), but this might not be correct. Wait, in the case where the decay is isotropic in the rest frame, the maximum angle in the lab is determined by the condition that the transverse velocity (perpendicular to the boost) is maximized relative to the longitudinal velocity.\n\nIn our case, the maximum transverse velocity in the lab frame is u'_y / γ, and the longitudinal velocity is v + u'_x / γ²(1 + ...). Wait, perhaps another approach.\n\nThe maximum angle occurs when the pion's velocity in the lab frame has the maximum possible transverse component relative to the direction of motion. The transverse component is u'_y / γ (from the Lorentz transformation), and the longitudinal component is (v + u'_x ) / (1 + (v u'_x )/c² )\n\nBut to maximize the angle, we need to maximize the ratio of transverse to longitudinal velocity. So we need to maximize (u'_y / γ ) / [ (v + u'_x ) / (1 + (v u'_x )/c² ) ]\n\nBut in the rest frame, the pion's speed is u', so u'_x = u' cosθ', u'_y = u' sinθ'. Therefore, the ratio becomes:\n\n[ u' sinθ' / γ ] / [ (v + u' cosθ' ) / (1 + (v u' cosθ')/c² ) ]\n\n= [ u' sinθ' (1 + (v u' cosθ')/c² ) ] / [ γ (v + u' cosθ' ) ]\n\nThis seems complicated. To maximize this ratio, we can take derivative with respect to θ' and set to zero, but it's quite involved. Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler relation.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in the lab frame, the maximum angle is achieved when the velocity vector of the pion is tangent to the circle resulting from the possible velocities when boosting from the rest frame. This is similar to the headlight effect, but for decay products.\n\nThe maximum angle is given by sinθ_max = (u' ) / (γ v ), but only if u' < γ v. Otherwise, the maximum angle is 90 degrees. Wait, but in our case, u' ≈0.8417c, γ v = (5/3)(0.8c) ≈1.333c. Since u' ≈0.8417c <1.333c, then sinθ_max =0.8417c /1.333c≈0.6313, so θ_max≈39 degrees (since sin^{-1}(0.6313)≈39 degrees). But this contradicts the earlier tanθ≈0.6313 which gives θ≈32 degrees. Hmm, there's inconsistency here.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is tanθ_max = u'/(γ v ), which would give tanθ=0.6313, θ≈32 degrees, but if we use sinθ_max=u'/(γ v ), then θ≈39 degrees. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me think. The velocity components in the lab frame are u_x = (u'_x + v)/(1 + (u'_x v)/c² ), u_y = u'_y / (γ (1 + (u'_x v)/c² )).\n\nIf we take the case where the pion is emitted perpendicularly in the rest frame (θ'=90 degrees), then u'_x=0, u'_y=u'.\n\nThen u_x = v / (1 +0 )=v=0.8c\n\nu_y= u' / (γ (1 +0 ))= u' / γ\n\nSo the speed components are u_x=0.8c, u_y=u'/γ.\n\nThe angle θ is given by tanθ= u_y /u_x = (u' / γ ) / v = u'/(γ v )\n\nSo tanθ= u'/(γ v )\n\nBut if we compute sinθ= u_y / |u|, where |u|=sqrt(u_x² +u_y² )\n\nBut |u|=sqrt(v² + (u'^2)/(γ² )) c\n\nWait, but velocities are in terms of c. Let me write them as fractions of c.\n\nSo u_x=0.8, u_y= (u'/c)/γ\n\nThen |u|=sqrt(0.8² + (u'/(γ c))^2 ) c\n\nBut u' is already a speed, so u'=β' c, where β'=sqrt(1 -4 m_π²/m_K² )\n\nSo u'=β' c, so u'/c=β'\n\nThus, u_x=0.8, u_y=β'/γ\n\nThen |u|=c sqrt(0.8² + (β'/γ )² )\n\nSo sinθ= u_y / |u| = (β'/γ ) / sqrt(0.8² + (β'/γ )² )\n\nBut this is more complicated. However, the angle θ is given by tanθ= (β'/γ ) /0.8\n\nSo tanθ= β'/(0.8 γ )\n\nBut β'=sqrt(1 -4 m_π²/m_K² )\n\nAnd γ=5/3 as before.\n\nSo tanθ= sqrt(1 -4 m_π²/m_K² ) / (0.8 *5/3 )= sqrt(1 -4 m_π²/m_K² ) / (4/3 )\n\nWhich is the same as before: tanθ= (3/4) sqrt(1 -4 m_π²/m_K² )\n\nTherefore, the maximum angle is indeed given by arctan of that quantity. So the answer is θ_max= arctan[ (3/4) sqrt(1 - (4 m_π²)/(m_K²)) ]\n\nAlternatively, this can be written using the masses:\n\nsqrt(1 - (4 m_π²)/(m_K²)) = sqrt( (m_K² -4 m_π²)/m_K² )= sqrt(m_K² -4 m_π²)/m_K\n\nSo tanθ_max= (3/4) * sqrt(m_K² -4 m_π²)/m_K\n\nBut the problem asks to express the answer in terms of the π and K masses, so either form is acceptable, but perhaps the first form is better.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for part (b) is θ_max= arctan[ (3/4) sqrt(1 - (4 m_π²)/(m_K²)) ]\n\nAlternatively, using the square root expression:\n\nθ_max= arctan( (3/(4 m_K)) sqrt(m_K² -4 m_π²) )\n\nBut both are equivalent.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\n(a) The threshold kinetic energy is [ (m_Ω + m_K+ + m_K0 )² - (m_p + m_K^- )² ] c² / (2 m_p )\n\n(b) The maximum angle is arctan[ (3/4) sqrt(1 - (4 m_π²/m_K²)) ]\n\nI need to check if there's any missing factor or mistake in the reasoning.\n\nFor part (a), the formula seems correct. The threshold condition is when the total energy in the center-of-mass frame equals the sum of the rest masses, leading to the invariant mass squared being equal to (sum m_final)^2 c^4. The derivation led to K_th = [ (sum m_final)^2 - (m_p + m_K^- )^2 ] c² / (2 m_p )\n\nYes, that's the standard formula for threshold energy when the target is at rest.\n\nFor part (b), the key steps were:\n\n1. Calculate the speed of the pions in the K0 rest frame using energy conservation: u' = c sqrt(1 - (4 m_π²/m_K²))\n\n2. When the pion is emitted perpendicularly in the K0 rest frame (θ'=90°), its velocity components in the lab frame are u_x = v =0.8c, u_y= u'/γ\n\n3. The angle in the lab is tanθ= u_y/u_x = (u'/γ)/v = (sqrt(1 -4 m_π²/m_K² ) / γ ) / (v/c )\n\nBut since v=0.8c, and γ=5/3, substituting gives tanθ= (sqrt(1 -4 m_π²/m_K² ) *3/5 ) /0.8 = (3 sqrt(...))/(4 )\n\nWhich matches the earlier result. Therefore, the answer seems correct.\n</think>\n\n(a) The threshold kinetic energy for the reaction \\( K^- + p \\rightarrow \\Omega^- + K^+ + K^0 \\) occurs when the total invariant mass squared equals the square of the sum of the final particles' rest masses.

{"id": "atomic/3-26", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The problem is asking for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the state with total angular momentum J = 3/2 and M = 1/2, given that j1 = 1 (so m1 can be -1, 0, +1) and j2 = 1/2 (so m2 can be -1/2, +1/2). The total M is m1 + m2 = 1/2. So I need to find the linear combination of the |m1, m2> states that form the |J=3/2, M=1/2> state.\n\nFirst, I remember that the highest weight state (M = J) is straightforward. For J=3/2, the highest M is 3/2, which would be the combination of m1=1 and m2=1/2. But here we need M=1/2. So maybe we can use the lowering operator to get from the highest state down to M=1/2.\n\nThe general approach is to apply the lowering operator J- = J1- + J2- to the |J=3/2, M=3/2> state, which is |m1=1, m2=1/2>. Each time we apply J-, we get the next lower M state multiplied by a coefficient. Let's do that step by step.\n\nStarting with |3/2, 3/2> = |1, 1/2>.\n\nApply J- to get |3/2, 1/2>:\n\nJ-|3/2, 3/2> = (J1- + J2-)|1, 1/2>\n\nThe lowering operator J1- acting on |1> gives sqrt(2)|0>, and J2- acting on |1/2> gives sqrt(1/2(1/2 +1) - (-1/2)(1/2)) ) | -1/2 >, which is sqrt(1*(1/2 +1/2 +1))? Wait, maybe I should recall the formula: J-|j, m> = sqrt(j(j+1) - m(m-1)) ħ |j, m-1>. But since we're working in units where ħ=1, it's just sqrt((j+m)(j-m+1)).\n\nSo for J1- acting on |j1=1, m1=1>:\n\nsqrt((1+1)(1-1+1)) = sqrt(2*1) = sqrt(2). So J1-|1> = sqrt(2)|0>.\n\nSimilarly, J2- acting on |j2=1/2, m2=1/2>:\n\nsqrt((1/2 + 1/2)(1/2 -1/2 +1)) = sqrt(1*1) = 1. So J2-|1/2> = | -1/2 >.\n\nTherefore, applying J- to |3/2, 3/2>:\n\nsqrt(2)|0, 1/2> + |1, -1/2> = sqrt( (3/2)(3/2 +1) - (3/2)(3/2 -1) ) |3/2, 1/2> ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the coefficient when applying J- to |J, M> is sqrt(J(J+1) - M(M-1)). So for |3/2, 3/2>, applying J- gives sqrt( (3/2)(3/2 +1) - (3/2)(3/2 -1) ) |3/2, 1/2> ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the general formula is:\n\nJ- |J, M> = sqrt( J(J+1) - M(M-1) ) |J, M-1>\n\nSo for J=3/2, M=3/2:\n\nsqrt( (3/2)(5/2) - (3/2)(1/2) ) = sqrt(15/4 - 3/4) = sqrt(12/4) = sqrt(3). So J- |3/2, 3/2> = sqrt(3) |3/2, 1/2>.\n\nBut we also have J- acting on the product state |1, 1/2> gives (J1- ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ J2-)|1, 1/2> = sqrt(2)|0, 1/2> + |1, -1/2>.\n\nTherefore, equating the two expressions:\n\nsqrt(3) |3/2, 1/2> = sqrt(2)|0, 1/2> + |1, -1/2>\n\nTherefore, |3/2, 1/2> = (sqrt(2)|0, 1/2> + |1, -1/2>)/sqrt(3)\n\nSo the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are:\n\nFor m1=0, m2=1/2: coefficient sqrt(2)/sqrt(3)\n\nFor m1=1, m2=-1/2: coefficient 1/sqrt(3)\n\nBut wait, are there other possible combinations? Let's check the possible m1 and m2 that sum to M=1/2.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\nm1=1, m2=-1/2 → 1 -1/2 = 1/2\n\nm1=0, m2=1/2 → 0 +1/2 =1/2\n\nm1=-1, m2=3/2 → but m2 can only be ±1/2, so this is invalid.\n\nSo only two terms contribute. Therefore, the state |3/2, 1/2> is a combination of |0,1/2> and |1,-1/2> with coefficients sqrt(2)/sqrt(3) and 1/sqrt(3), respectively.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the normalization. The coefficients squared should add up to 1. (sqrt(2)/sqrt(3))² + (1/sqrt(3))² = 2/3 +1/3=1. Correct.\n\nSo the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are:\n\n⟨1,0; 1/2,1/2 | 3/2,1/2⟩ = sqrt(2/3)\n\n⟨1,1; 1/2,-1/2 | 3/2,1/2⟩ = sqrt(1/3)\n\nBut wait, the order is j1, m1; j2, m2. So yes, the first term is m1=0, m2=1/2, and the second is m1=1, m2=-1/2.\n\nTherefore, the coefficients are sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3). So that's part (a) done.\n\nNow part (b). The reactions involve pions and nucleons. The problem states that these reactions conserve isospin and can occur via I=3/2 (Δ resonance) or I=1/2 (N* resonance). We need to compute the cross-section ratios σ1:σ2:σ3 for each resonance (Δ and N*), assuming that at resonance energy, the other isospin state's contribution is negligible.\n\nFirst, recall that cross-sections are proportional to the square of the matrix element, which depends on the isospin coupling. The cross-section for a particular reaction channel is proportional to |⟨f| Hint |i⟩|². Since we're considering only one isospin state (either I=3/2 or I=1/2) at resonance, the cross-section should be proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the initial and final states in the isospin coupling.\n\nThe initial state for each reaction is a pion and a nucleon. The pion has isospin I=1, and the nucleon (proton or neutron) has isospin I=1/2. The combined system can have total isospin I=3/2 or I=1/2.\n\nSimilarly, the final state is another pion and nucleon. So the reaction's isospin structure is determined by the initial and final isospin states.\n\nThe reactions are:\n\n1. π⁺ p → π⁺ p\n\n2. π⁻ p → π⁻ p\n\n3. π⁻ p → π⁰ n\n\nWe need to express the initial and final states in terms of the total isospin I and I_z, then find the overlap (Clebsch-Gordan coefficients) for each reaction when the process is dominated by I=3/2 or I=1/2.\n\nFirst, let's recall the isospin states:\n\nPion (I=1):\n\nπ⁺: I=1, I_z=+1\n\nπ⁰: I=1, I_z=0\n\nπ⁻: I=1, I_z=-1\n\nNucleon (I=1/2):\n\nProton p: I=1/2, I_z=+1/2\n\nNeutron n: I=1/2, I_z=-1/2\n\nThe initial state for each reaction:\n\n1. π⁺ + p: I1=1, Iz1=+1; I2=1/2, Iz2=+1/2. Total Iz = +3/2.\n\n2. π⁻ + p: Iz = -1 +1/2 = -1/2.\n\n3. π⁻ + p: Iz = -1 +1/2 = -1/2.\n\nThe final states:\n\n1. π⁺ + p: same as initial, Iz=+3/2.\n\n2. π⁻ + p: Iz=-1/2.\n\n3. π⁰ + n: π⁰ has Iz=0, neutron has Iz=-1/2. Total Iz= -1/2.\n\nSo for each reaction, the initial and final Iz are:\n\n1. Iz=3/2 → Iz=3/2\n\n2. Iz=-1/2 → Iz=-1/2\n\n3. Iz=-1/2 → Iz=-1/2\n\nNow, the initial and final states can be expressed in terms of total isospin I and Iz. The cross-section will depend on the overlap between the initial and final states in the isospin space. Since the interaction conserves isospin, the matrix element is non-zero only if the initial and final states have the same total I and Iz. But since we are considering that the reaction proceeds through a resonance (either I=3/2 or I=1/2), the amplitude is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the initial state to be in that I, and similarly for the final state.\n\nAssuming that the resonance is an intermediate state with definite I, then the amplitude is proportional to the product of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the initial and final states to couple to that I.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section σ ∝ |⟨I, Iz | initial⟩ ⟨I, Iz | final⟩|². But since the initial and final Iz must match, and the resonance has a particular I, then the cross-section is proportional to |⟨I, Iz | initial⟩|² * |⟨I, Iz | final⟩|². However, since the process is initial → resonance → final, and assuming the resonance is the same I for both, then the amplitude is proportional to ⟨I, Iz | initial⟩ ⟨final | I, Iz⟩, so the cross-section is proportional to |⟨I, Iz | initial⟩|² * |⟨I, Iz | final⟩|². But wait, actually, if the resonance is in a particular I state, then the initial state must have a component in that I, and the final state must also have the same I. Therefore, the amplitude is proportional to the product of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for initial and final states to be in the same I, Iz. Therefore, the cross-section σ ∝ |⟨I, Iz | initial⟩ ⟨I, Iz | final⟩|². But since Iz is fixed (for each reaction), and I is fixed (either 3/2 or 1/2), then for each reaction, the cross-section is proportional to |⟨I, Iz | initial⟩|² * |⟨I, Iz | final⟩|². However, since the final state must have the same I and Iz as the initial (because the interaction conserves isospin), then actually, the cross-section is proportional to |⟨I, Iz | initial⟩|² * |⟨I, Iz | final⟩|². But if the final state is the same as the initial (as in reactions 1 and 2), then it's just |⟨I, Iz | initial⟩|^4. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, since the process is initial → resonance (I) → final, the amplitude is proportional to ⟨final | I, Iz⟩ ⟨I, Iz | initial⟩. Therefore, the cross-section is proportional to |⟨I, Iz | initial⟩ ⟨final | I, Iz⟩|² = |⟨I, Iz | initial⟩|² |⟨I, Iz | final⟩|².\n\nBut for reactions 1 and 2, the final state is the same as the initial state, so ⟨final | I, Iz⟩ = ⟨initial | I, Iz⟩*, so the cross-section would be |⟨I, Iz | initial⟩|^4. But for reaction 3, the final state is different, so we need to compute ⟨final | I, Iz⟩ and multiply by ⟨I, Iz | initial⟩.\n\nBut let's clarify. Let's take reaction 1: π⁺ p → π⁺ p. The initial and final states are the same, so the amplitude is proportional to |⟨I, Iz | initial⟩|², and the cross-section is proportional to |⟨I, Iz | initial⟩|^4. Wait, no. Wait, the amplitude is ⟨final | T | initial⟩, and if T conserves isospin, then T acts on the isospin states. If the resonance is a particular I, then the amplitude is dominated by the component of the initial and final states in that I. So the amplitude is proportional to ⟨I, Iz | initial⟩ ⟨I, Iz | final⟩*, assuming the transition goes through the resonance. Therefore, the cross-section is proportional to |⟨I, Iz | initial⟩ ⟨I, Iz | final⟩|².\n\nBut for reaction 1, initial and final are the same, so it's |⟨I, Iz | initial⟩|^4. For reaction 3, the final state is different, so it's |⟨I, Iz | initial⟩ ⟨I, Iz | final⟩|².\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, for each reaction, we need to write the initial and final states in terms of the total isospin I and Iz.\n\nLet's start with reaction 1: π⁺ p → π⁺ p.\n\nInitial state: |π⁺ p> = |I1=1, Iz1=+1> |I2=1/2, Iz2=+1/2> = |1, +1> |1/2, +1/2>.\n\nThis couples to total I=3/2 and I=1/2. The possible Iz = +1 +1/2 = +3/2. But the maximum Iz for I=3/2 is +3/2, so the state |3/2, +3/2> is just |1, +1> |1/2, +1/2>.\n\nSimilarly, the other states can be found by lowering, but in this case, since Iz=+3/2 can only come from I=3/2, the initial state for reaction 1 is purely I=3/2, Iz=3/2. Because when you combine |1, +1> and |1/2, +1/2>, the only possible total I is 3/2 and 1/2. But the state with maximum Iz=3/2 must be the highest state of the I=3/2 multiplet. Therefore, the initial state |π⁺ p> is entirely in the I=3/2, Iz=3/2 state. Therefore, ⟨3/2, 3/2 | π⁺ p ⟩ =1, and ⟨1/2, 3/2 | π⁺ p ⟩ =0 (since Iz=3/2 can't be in I=1/2). Therefore, for reaction 1, when the resonance is I=3/2, the amplitude is proportional to 1 (since the initial and final states are entirely in I=3/2), so the cross-section σ1 for Δ resonance (I=3/2) is proportional to |1 *1|²=1. For N* resonance (I=1/2), since the initial state has zero overlap with I=1/2, σ1=0.\n\nBut wait, this seems too straightforward. Let me check. The initial state for reaction 1 is |1, +1> |1/2, +1/2>, which is the same as |3/2, 3/2>. Therefore, when the resonance is I=3/2, the amplitude is maximal, and when it's I=1/2, there's no overlap. Therefore, for Δ resonance (I=3/2), σ1 is non-zero, and for N* (I=1/2), σ1=0.\n\nSimilarly, reaction 2: π⁻ p → π⁻ p.\n\nInitial state: |π⁻ p> = |1, -1> |1/2, +1/2>. Total Iz = -1 +1/2 = -1/2.\n\nThis can be part of both I=3/2 and I=1/2. We need to decompose this state into I=3/2 and I=1/2 components.\n\nSimilarly, reaction 3: π⁻ p → π⁰ n.\n\nInitial state: |π⁻ p> = |1, -1> |1/2, +1/2> (Iz=-1/2), final state |π⁰ n> = |1, 0> |1/2, -1/2> (Iz=0 -1/2 = -1/2). So both initial and final have Iz=-1/2.\n\nWe need to express the initial and final states in terms of I=3/2 and I=1/2.\n\nLet's first handle the initial states for reactions 2 and 3.\n\nFor the initial state of reaction 2 and 3: |π⁻ p> = |1, -1> |1/2, +1/2>.\n\nWe need to find the decomposition of this state into total I=3/2 and I=1/2.\n\nSimilarly, the final state for reaction 3 is |π⁰ n> = |1, 0> |1/2, -1/2>.\n\nWe need to decompose this into total I=3/2 and I=1/2.\n\nLet's start with the initial state |1, -1> |1/2, +1/2>.\n\nThe total Iz = -1 +1/2 = -1/2.\n\nThe possible total I are 3/2 and 1/2. We need to find the combination of |I, Iz=-1/2> states.\n\nTo find the coefficients, we can use Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nThe state |I=3/2, Iz=-1/2> and |I=1/2, Iz=-1/2> can be expressed in terms of the product states |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1/2.\n\nPossible m1 and m2:\n\nFor the initial state, m1=-1 (from π⁻) and m2=+1/2 (from p), which sums to -1/2.\n\nAnother possible combination is m1=0 (but π⁻ has m1=-1, so no). Wait, no. The initial state is specifically |1, -1> |1/2, +1/2>, so only one term: m1=-1, m2=+1/2.\n\nBut when decomposing into total I, we need to express this as a combination of |3/2, -1/2> and |1/2, -1/2>.\n\nTo find the coefficients, we can use the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling I1=1 and I2=1/2 to total I=3/2 and I=1/2.\n\nThe state |3/2, -1/2> can be obtained by applying the lowering operator to |3/2, 3/2> three times. Alternatively, we can use the symmetry properties or look up the coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, recall that the state |I=3/2, Iz=-1/2> is a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1/2. The possible m1 and m2 are:\n\nm1=0, m2=-1/2 (sum to -1/2)\n\nm1=-1, m2=+1/2 (sum to -1/2)\n\nSo the state |3/2, -1/2> is a combination of these two.\n\nSimilarly, the state |1/2, -1/2> is another combination orthogonal to |3/2, -1/2>.\n\nTo find the coefficients, we can use the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nFrom the tables, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling I1=1 and I2=1/2 to I=3/2 and I=1/2.\n\nFor the state |3/2, -1/2>:\n\nThe coefficients are given by:\n\n⟨1, m1; 1/2, m2 | 3/2, -1/2⟩.\n\nPossible m1 and m2 pairs that sum to -1/2 are m1=0, m2=-1/2 and m1=-1, m2=+1/2.\n\nThe coefficients can be found using the lowering operator approach.\n\nStarting from |3/2, 3/2> = |1, 1> |1/2, 1/2>.\n\nApply J- three times to reach |3/2, -1/2>.\n\nAlternatively, use recursion relations.\n\nAlternatively, recall that the coefficients for |3/2, -1/2> are sqrt(2/3) |0, -1/2> + sqrt(1/3) |-1, 1/2>.\n\nWait, but let's check:\n\nFrom part (a), we had for J=3/2, M=1/2: sqrt(2/3)|0,1/2> + sqrt(1/3)|1,-1/2>.\n\nBut here we need M=-1/2. Let's apply the lowering operator again.\n\nStarting from |3/2, 1/2> = sqrt(2/3)|0,1/2> + sqrt(1/3)|1,-1/2>.\n\nApply J- to get |3/2, -1/2>:\n\nJ- = J1- + J2-.\n\nJ1- acting on |0> gives sqrt(2)|-1>, and J2- acting on |-1/2> gives 0 (since m2=-1/2 is the lowest for j2=1/2).\n\nWait, no. Wait, J1- acting on |0> (m1=0) gives sqrt(1(1+1) -0(0-1)) | -1 > = sqrt(2) |-1>.\n\nJ2- acting on |1/2, -1/2> gives 0 because m2=-1/2 is the lowest state.\n\nWait, but in the state |3/2, 1/2>, we have components |0,1/2> and |1,-1/2>.\n\nApplying J-:\n\nJ-|3/2,1/2> = (J1- + J2-)(sqrt(2/3)|0,1/2> + sqrt(1/3)|1,-1/2>)\n\n= sqrt(2/3) J1-|0> |1/2> + sqrt(2/3) J2-|0> |1/2> + sqrt(1/3) J1-|1> |-1/2> + sqrt(1/3) J2-|1> |-1/2>\n\nBut wait, J1- acts on the first ket, J2- on the second.\n\nSo:\n\n= sqrt(2/3) (J1-|0>) |1/2> + sqrt(2/3) |0> (J2-|1/2>) + sqrt(1/3) (J1-|1>) |-1/2> + sqrt(1/3) |1> (J2-|-1/2>)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nJ1-|0> = sqrt(1(1+1) -0(0-1)) |-1> = sqrt(2) |-1>\n\nJ2-|1/2> = sqrt(1/2(1/2+1) - (1/2)(-1/2)) | -1/2 > = sqrt( (1/2)(3/2) - (-1/2)(1/2) ) | -1/2 > = sqrt(3/4 +1/4) = sqrt(1) =1. So J2-|1/2> = | -1/2 >.\n\nJ1-|1> = sqrt(1(2) -1(0)) |0> = sqrt(2)|0>\n\nJ2-|-1/2> =0 (since m2=-1/2 is the lowest)\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n= sqrt(2/3) * sqrt(2) |-1> |1/2> + sqrt(2/3)* |0> | -1/2 > + sqrt(1/3)*sqrt(2)|0> |-1/2> + sqrt(1/3)*|1> *0\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst term: sqrt(2/3)*sqrt(2) = sqrt(4/3) = 2/sqrt(3)\n\nSecond term: sqrt(2/3)\n\nThird term: sqrt(1/3)*sqrt(2) = sqrt(2/3)\n\nFourth term: 0\n\nSo total:\n\n2/sqrt(3) |-1,1/2> + (sqrt(2/3) + sqrt(2/3)) |0,-1/2>\n\n= 2/sqrt(3) |-1,1/2> + 2*sqrt(2/3) |0,-1/2>\n\nBut wait, J-|3/2,1/2> should equal sqrt(3/2*(3/2 +1) - (1/2)(-1/2)) |3/2,-1/2> ?\n\nWait, the coefficient from applying J- once to |3/2,1/2>:\n\nJ-|3/2,1/2> = sqrt( (3/2)(5/2) - (1/2)(-1/2) ) |3/2,-1/2> = sqrt(15/4 +1/4) = sqrt(16/4)=sqrt(4)=2. So J-|3/2,1/2> = 2 |3/2,-1/2>.\n\nBut according to the previous calculation, we have:\n\n2/sqrt(3) |-1,1/2> + 2*sqrt(2/3) |0,-1/2> = 2 |3/2,-1/2>\n\nTherefore, |3/2,-1/2> = (1/sqrt(3)) |-1,1/2> + sqrt(2/3) |0,-1/2>\n\nTherefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are:\n\n⟨1,-1; 1/2,1/2 | 3/2,-1/2⟩ = 1/sqrt(3)\n\n⟨1,0; 1/2,-1/2 | 3/2,-1/2⟩ = sqrt(2/3)\n\nSimilarly, the state |1/2,-1/2> must be orthogonal to |3/2,-1/2>. Therefore:\n\n|1/2,-1/2> = sqrt(2/3) |-1,1/2> - 1/sqrt(3) |0,-1/2>\n\nCheck normalization: (2/3 +1/3)=1. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the initial state for reaction 2 and 3 is |1,-1> |1/2,1/2> = |-1,1/2> which is part of the decomposition into |3/2,-1/2> and |1/2,-1/2>:\n\n|-1,1/2> = 1/sqrt(3) |3/2,-1/2> + sqrt(2/3) |1/2,-1/2>\n\nTherefore, the initial state |π⁻ p> has components:\n\nsqrt(1/3) in I=3/2 and sqrt(2/3) in I=1/2.\n\nSimilarly, the final state for reaction 2 is the same as the initial state, so the decomposition is the same.\n\nFor reaction 3, the final state is |π⁰ n> = |1,0> |1/2,-1/2>.\n\nWe need to decompose this into I=3/2 and I=1/2.\n\nThe total Iz=0 + (-1/2)= -1/2.\n\nThe possible m1 and m2 combinations are:\n\nm1=0, m2=-1/2 (sum to -1/2)\n\nm1=-1, m2=+1/2 (sum to -1/2)\n\nBut the final state is |0, -1/2> (m1=0, m2=-1/2).\n\nSo we need to express |0, -1/2> in terms of |I=3/2, Iz=-1/2> and |I=1/2, Iz=-1/2>.\n\nFrom the previous decomposition, |3/2,-1/2> = 1/sqrt(3) |-1,1/2> + sqrt(2/3) |0,-1/2>\n\nWait, no. Wait, the state |3/2,-1/2> is a combination of |-1,1/2> and |0,-1/2> as found earlier. But the final state here is |0,-1/2>, which is part of the decomposition.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the orthogonality. The state |0,-1/2> can be expressed in terms of |3/2,-1/2> and |1/2,-1/2>.\n\nFrom the previous results:\n\n|3/2,-1/2> = 1/sqrt(3) |-1,1/2> + sqrt(2/3) |0,-1/2>\n\n|1/2,-1/2> = sqrt(2/3) |-1,1/2> - 1/sqrt(3) |0,-1/2>\n\nWe can solve for |0,-1/2>:\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\nsqrt(2/3) |0,-1/2> = |3/2,-1/2> - 1/sqrt(3) |-1,1/2>\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(3/2):\n\n|0,-1/2> = sqrt(3/2) |3/2,-1/2> - sqrt(1/2) |-1,1/2>\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, since we have:\n\n|3/2,-1/2> = 1/sqrt(3) |-1,1/2> + sqrt(2/3) |0,-1/2>\n\nand\n\n|1/2,-1/2> = sqrt(2/3) |-1,1/2> - 1/sqrt(3) |0,-1/2>\n\nWe can invert these equations to express |0,-1/2> in terms of |3/2,-1/2> and |1/2,-1/2>.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\nsqrt(2/3) |0,-1/2> = |3/2,-1/2> - 1/sqrt(3) |-1,1/2>\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\n-1/sqrt(3) |0,-1/2> = |1/2,-1/2> - sqrt(2/3) |-1,1/2>\n\nMultiply both sides by -sqrt(3):\n\n|0,-1/2> = -sqrt(3) |1/2,-1/2> + sqrt(2) |-1,1/2>\n\nBut substituting this into the first equation:\n\nsqrt(2/3) (-sqrt(3) |1/2,-1/2> + sqrt(2) |-1,1/2> ) = |3/2,-1/2> - 1/sqrt(3) |-1,1/2>\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n-sqrt(2/3)*sqrt(3) |1/2,-1/2> + sqrt(2/3)*sqrt(2) |-1,1/2>\n\n= -sqrt(2) |1/2,-1/2> + (2/sqrt(3)) |-1,1/2>\n\nRight side:\n\n|3/2,-1/2> - 1/sqrt(3) |-1,1/2>\n\nEquating coefficients:\n\nFor |-1,1/2>:\n\n2/sqrt(3) = -1/sqrt(3) → This is not possible. Therefore, there must be an error in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use orthogonality. The state |0,-1/2> must be a combination of |3/2,-1/2> and |1/2,-1/2>.\n\nLet’s write |0,-1/2> = a |3/2,-1/2> + b |1/2,-1/2>\n\nWe need to find a and b such that this holds. To find a and b, take the inner product with ⟨3/2,-1/2| and ⟨1/2,-1/2|.\n\n⟨3/2,-1/2 | 0,-1/2> = a ⟨3/2,-1/2 |3/2,-1/2> + b ⟨3/2,-1/2 |1/2,-1/2> = a*1 + b*0 = a\n\nBut ⟨3/2,-1/2 |0,-1/2> is the coefficient of |0,-1/2> in |3/2,-1/2>, which is sqrt(2/3). Therefore, a = sqrt(2/3)\n\nSimilarly, ⟨1/2,-1/2 |0,-1/2> = a*0 + b*1 = b\n\nBut ⟨1/2,-1/2 |0,-1/2> is the coefficient of |0,-1/2> in |1/2,-1/2>, which is -1/sqrt(3). Therefore, b = -1/sqrt(3)\n\nTherefore, |0,-1/2> = sqrt(2/3) |3/2,-1/2> - 1/sqrt(3) |1/2,-1/2>\n\nSo the final state for reaction 3, |π⁰ n> = |0,-1/2> = sqrt(2/3) |3/2,-1/2> - 1/sqrt(3) |1/2,-1/2>\n\nNow, for each reaction, when the resonance is I=3/2 (Δ), the amplitude is proportional to the overlap of the initial and final states with I=3/2.\n\nFor reaction 1: initial and final states are purely I=3/2, so σ1 (Δ) ∝ |1 *1|²=1.\n\nFor reaction 2: initial state has a component of sqrt(1/3) in I=3/2 and sqrt(2/3) in I=1/2. But since we're at Δ resonance (I=3/2), the amplitude is proportional to the initial overlap with I=3/2 and the final overlap (same as initial) with I=3/2. So σ2 (Δ) ∝ |sqrt(1/3) * sqrt(1/3)|² = (1/3 *1/3) =1/9. Wait, no. Wait, the amplitude is ⟨I=3/2 | initial⟩ * ⟨final | I=3/2⟩. Since the initial and final states are the same for reaction 2, it's |⟨3/2,-1/2 | initial⟩|². The initial state is |π⁻ p> = sqrt(1/3) |3/2,-1/2> + sqrt(2/3) |1/2,-1/2>. Therefore, the overlap with I=3/2 is sqrt(1/3). Therefore, the amplitude is proportional to sqrt(1/3), and the cross-section is |sqrt(1/3)|² * |sqrt(1/3)|² = (1/3)^2 =1/9. Wait, but actually, the amplitude is ⟨3/2,-1/2 | initial⟩ * ⟨final |3/2,-1/2⟩. Since initial and final are the same, it's |⟨3/2,-1/2 | initial⟩|². Which is (1/3).

{"id": "atomic/3-19", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The reaction given is pp → HK⁺K⁺. I need to find the electric charge, strangeness, and baryon number of particle H, as well as determine how many quarks it contains. \n\nStarting with conservation laws. In particle reactions, electric charge, baryon number, and strangeness (if the reaction is strong or electromagnetic) should be conserved. Let's check each quantity.\n\nFirst, the initial state: two protons. Each proton has a charge of +1, so total charge is +2. Each proton has a baryon number of +1, so total baryon number is +2. Strangeness for protons is 0, so total initial strangeness is 0.\n\nThe final state is H, K⁺, and another K⁺. Let's look at the kaons. Each K⁺ has a charge of +1, so two K⁺ give +2. The total charge of the final state must equal the initial charge, which is +2. Therefore, H must have charge Q such that Q + 2 = 2 → Q = 0. So H is neutral.\n\nBaryon number: protons have baryon number +1 each, so initial total is +2. Kaons (K⁺) are mesons, so their baryon number is 0. Therefore, H must have baryon number +2 to conserve the total. Because the initial baryon number is +2, H must carry that. So H has baryon number +2.\n\nStrangeness: protons have strangeness 0. Kaons: K⁺ has a strangeness of +1. Wait, no. Wait, the K⁺ is composed of u and s̄ quarks. The strangeness is the number of s quarks minus s̄. Since K⁺ is u s̄, so s̄ is -1, so strangeness is +1? Wait, no. Strangeness is defined as S = -(number of s quarks) + (number of s̄ quarks). Wait, no, actually, the convention is that the strangeness quantum number is equal to the number of s quarks minus the number of s̄ quarks, multiplied by -1. Wait, let me recall. The strangeness S of a particle is given by S = (number of s̄ quarks - number of s quarks). Because, for example, the K⁺ is u s̄, so it has one s̄ quark. So S = +1. Yes, that's right. So each K⁺ has S = +1. Therefore, two K⁺ give total S = +2. The initial state has S = 0. So the total strangeness in the final state must be +2. Therefore, H must have S = -2 to make the total S = -2 + 2 = 0? Wait, no. Wait, initial S is 0. Final S must be 0 if the reaction is via strong interaction. But wait, the reaction pp → HK⁺K⁺: if this is a strong interaction process, then strangeness can be violated only if the reaction is via the weak interaction. Wait, but in strong interactions, strangeness is not conserved. Wait, no: in strong interactions, strangeness can change because s quarks can be created or annihilated. Wait, actually, in strong interactions, strangeness is not conserved. Only in processes mediated by the strong force can strangeness change. For example, in reactions involving creation or annihilation of strange quarks. So if this reaction is via the strong force, then strangeness doesn't need to be conserved. But if it's via the weak force, then maybe other considerations. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we need to assume that the reaction conserves strangeness? Wait, but in reality, strong interactions do not conserve strangeness. For example, the decay of kaons is via the weak interaction because the strong interaction doesn't conserve strangeness. Wait, maybe the problem is expecting us to apply conservation laws as if it's a strong interaction process. Hmm. Wait, but in the problem statement, the reaction is pp → HK⁺K⁺. If this is a strong interaction process, then strangeness doesn't need to be conserved. However, if the problem is expecting us to use conservation laws, perhaps we need to check. Wait, but maybe the problem is assuming that the reaction is possible via strong interaction, so we can ignore strangeness conservation. But then, how do we determine the strangeness of H? Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to use conservation of charge, baryon number, and maybe other quantum numbers. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting us to use conservation laws for charge, baryon number, and strangeness. But in reality, in strong interactions, charge and baryon number are conserved, but strangeness is not. So maybe the problem is assuming that the reaction is possible via strong interaction, so we don't need to conserve strangeness. But then, how do we find the strangeness of H? Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the reaction is via the strong interaction, so strangeness doesn't need to be conserved. Therefore, the strangeness of H could be anything. But the problem is asking for the value of strangeness of H. So perhaps the problem is expecting us to use conservation of charge, baryon number, and maybe other quantum numbers. Wait, but if the reaction is via the strong interaction, then only charge, baryon number, and other quantum numbers like isospin are conserved. Strangeness is not conserved. So maybe the problem is not expecting us to use strangeness conservation here. But then, how do we find the strangeness of H? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is a typo, and the reaction is via the weak interaction, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to use conservation of strangeness even though it's a strong interaction. That might be a mistake, but perhaps the problem is set in a context where we are to assume that. Let me check the initial and final strangeness.\n\nInitial state: protons have S=0. Final state: two K⁺ each with S=+1, so total S=+2. Therefore, if the reaction conserves strangeness, then H must have S=-2. But if the reaction does not conserve strangeness, then H's strangeness is not determined by this. However, the problem is asking for the value of strangeness of H. So perhaps we are to assume that the reaction conserves strangeness, even if that's not typical for strong interactions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the H is produced via a process that conserves strangeness. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check standard conservation laws. In strong interactions, the conserved quantities are electric charge, baryon number, and color (but color is not a quantum number we consider here). Strangeness is not conserved in strong interactions. For example, in the decay of a Lambda particle, which is a weak decay, but production processes can create strange particles via strong interactions. For example, in the reaction p + p → K⁺ + Lambda + something, the Lambda has S=-1, and the K⁺ has S=+1, so total S=0. But initial S=0. So in that case, strangeness is conserved. Wait, but that's a production process. Hmm. Maybe in production processes via strong interaction, strangeness can be created in pairs. So for example, creating a particle with S=+1 and another with S=-1. But in this case, we have two K⁺, each with S=+1, so total S=+2. So if the reaction is via strong interaction, then H must have S=-2 to conserve strangeness. But wait, in strong interactions, can you create two units of strangeness without a corresponding -2? Because in strong interactions, s and s̄ quarks can be created, but typically in pairs. For example, creating an s and s̄ pair. So if you have two K⁺, each has an s̄ quark. So that's two s̄ quarks. So the H must contain two s quarks to balance that? Because each s quark has S=-1 (since S = s̄ - s). Wait, no. Let me clarify. The strangeness of a particle is S = (number of s quarks - number of s̄ quarks) multiplied by -1. Wait, no. The standard definition is S = -(number of s quarks) + (number of s̄ quarks). Wait, let me check. For example, the K⁺ is u s̄. So it has one s̄ quark. So S = +1. The Lambda particle is uds, so it has one s quark. So S = -1. So yes, S = (number of s̄ - number of s). Therefore, if the two K⁺ have a total of two s̄ quarks, then the H must have two s quarks to balance, giving S = (0 - 2) = -2. Therefore, H has S = -2. But this would require that the reaction conserves strangeness. However, as I thought earlier, strong interactions do not conserve strangeness. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem is assuming that the reaction conserves strangeness, even if that's not typical. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the H is produced in a reaction that conserves strangeness, perhaps via the weak interaction. But weak interactions are slow, so production reactions are usually strong or electromagnetic. Hmm. This is confusing. Let me check the problem statement again. The reaction is pp → HK⁺K⁺. The problem is part of an exam question, so likely expects application of conservation laws assuming the reaction is via strong interaction. But in strong interactions, strangeness is not conserved. Therefore, perhaps the problem is not expecting us to use strangeness conservation here. But then, how do we find the strangeness of H? Alternatively, maybe the problem is in error, but I need to proceed. Let's see. If we ignore strangeness conservation, then the strangeness of H is not determined by the reaction. But the problem is asking for the value, so perhaps H must have a certain strangeness based on its quark content. Wait, but we don't know the quark content yet. The problem also asks how many quarks H must contain. Let's think about that. The H has baryon number +2. Baryon number is 1/3 per quark. So for a baryon number of +2, H must contain 6 quarks (since each quark has baryon number 1/3, so 6 quarks give 6*(1/3) = 2). So H is a dibaryon, composed of 6 quarks. So the answer to the last part is 6 quarks. Now, for the charge: H has charge 0. So the sum of the charges of the 6 quarks must be 0. Also, the strangeness is S = (number of s̄ - number of s). If H has S = -2, then (s̄ - s) = -2 → s - s̄ = 2. So there are two more s quarks than s̄. But if the reaction doesn't conserve strangeness, then H could have any strangeness. But the problem is asking for the value, so perhaps we need to assume conservation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to calculate based on conservation, even if it's not strictly correct. Let's proceed under that assumption. So initial S = 0, final S = S_H + 2*(+1) = S_H + 2. For conservation, S_initial = S_final → 0 = S_H + 2 → S_H = -2. Therefore, H has strangeness -2. So the values are: charge Q=0, strangeness S=-2, baryon number B=+2, and it contains 6 quarks. That seems to fit. So part (a) answers: charge 0, strangeness -2, baryon number +2, 6 quarks.\n\nMoving to part (b): The mass of H is 2150 MeV. We need to find the minimum incident-beam proton momentum necessary to produce H, assuming target protons are at rest. This is a threshold calculation. The minimum momentum corresponds to the case where all the final particles are produced at rest in the center-of-momentum frame. But since the target is at rest, we need to use the lab frame. The threshold condition occurs when the kinetic energy of the incident proton is just enough to produce the rest mass of the final particles, with all final particles at rest in the center-of-mass frame. Alternatively, the minimum beam momentum is when the final particles are produced with zero kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame. The formula for the threshold energy in lab frame (target at rest) is given by:\n\nE_threshold = [ (m_H + 2m_K)^2 - (m_p)^2 ] / (2m_p)\n\nBut wait, the reaction is pp → H K⁺ K⁺. So the total rest mass of the products is m_H + 2m_K. The initial rest mass is 2m_p (since two protons). Wait, but one proton is at rest, and the other is moving. So the threshold energy calculation is a bit different. The threshold occurs when the kinetic energy is such that the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products. The formula for the minimum kinetic energy of the incident proton in the lab frame is:\n\nE_lab_min = [(Σm_final)^2 - (m_p + m_p)^2]/(2m_p)\n\nWait, Σm_final is m_H + 2m_K. But let's check the formula. The threshold condition is when the total energy in the CM frame is equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products. The total energy squared in the CM frame is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2. Since the target is at rest, E2 = m_p c², p2 = 0. The incident proton has energy E1 = γ m_p c², momentum p1 = γ β m_p c. So s = (γ m_p c² + m_p c²)^2 - (γ β m_p c²)^2. Expanding this:\n\ns = [m_p c² (γ + 1)]² - [γ β m_p c²]^2\n\n= (m_p c²)^2 [ (γ + 1)^2 - (γ β)^2 ]\n\nBut (γ β)^2 = γ² β² = γ² (1 - 1/γ²) = γ² - 1\n\nSo s = (m_p c²)^2 [ (γ + 1)^2 - (γ² - 1) ]\n\n= (m_p c²)^2 [ γ² + 2γ + 1 - γ² + 1 ]\n\n= (m_p c²)^2 [2γ + 2]\n\n= 2 (m_p c²)^2 (γ + 1)\n\nAt threshold, s must be equal to (Σm_final c²)^2 = (m_H + 2m_K)^2 c^4.\n\nTherefore:\n\n2 (m_p c²)^2 (γ + 1) = (m_H + 2m_K)^2 c^4\n\nDivide both sides by c^4:\n\n2 m_p² (γ + 1) = (m_H + 2m_K)^2\n\nSolve for γ:\n\nγ + 1 = (m_H + 2m_K)^2 / (2 m_p²)\n\nThen γ = [ (m_H + 2m_K)^2 / (2 m_p²) ] - 1\n\nThe kinetic energy of the incident proton is (γ - 1) m_p c². But the question asks for the minimum incident-beam proton momentum. Momentum p = γ β m_p c. We need to express p in terms of γ. Since β = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²), but this might get complicated. Alternatively, use the relation:\n\nE_total² = (pc)^2 + (m_p c²)^2\n\nWhere E_total is the total energy of the incident proton, which is γ m_p c². So:\n\n(γ m_p c²)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_p c²)^2\n\n=> (pc)^2 = (γ² - 1)(m_p c²)^2\n\n=> p = m_p c sqrt(γ² - 1)\n\nBut we need to compute γ from the threshold condition. Let's plug in the numbers.\n\nGiven m_H = 2150 MeV/c², m_K⁺ is approximately 494 MeV/c² (I remember that kaons are around 494 MeV/c²), and m_p is about 938 MeV/c².\n\nSo Σm_final = 2150 + 2*494 = 2150 + 988 = 3138 MeV/c²\n\nThen:\n\nγ + 1 = (3138)^2 / (2 * 938^2)\n\nCalculate numerator: 3138² = (3000 + 138)^2 = 3000² + 2*3000*138 + 138² = 9,000,000 + 828,000 + 19,044 = 9,847,044 (MeV/c²)^2\n\nDenominator: 2 * 938² = 2 * 880,  (Wait, 938^2 = (900 + 38)^2 = 900² + 2*900*38 + 38² = 810,000 + 68,400 + 1,444 = 879,844. So 2*879,844 = 1,759,688 (MeV/c²)^2\n\nSo γ + 1 = 9,847,044 / 1,759,688 ≈ 5.596\n\nTherefore, γ ≈ 5.596 - 1 = 4.596\n\nNow, compute p = m_p c sqrt(γ² - 1)\n\nγ² = (4.596)^2 ≈ 21.12\n\nγ² - 1 ≈ 20.12\n\nsqrt(20.12) ≈ 4.486\n\nSo p ≈ 938 MeV/c * 4.486 ≈ 938 * 4.486 ≈ Let's calculate that:\n\n938 * 4 = 3752\n\n938 * 0.486 = 938 * 0.4 = 375.2; 938 * 0.086 ≈ 80.7\n\nSo total ≈ 3752 + 375.2 + 80.7 ≈ 4207.9 MeV/c\n\nSo approximately 4208 MeV/c. But let me check the exact calculation:\n\nγ = 4.596\n\nγ² = 4.596^2 = 4.596*4.596\n\nCalculate 4*4.596 = 18.384\n\n0.596*4.596 = approx 0.5*4.596=2.298 + 0.096*4.596≈0.441 = 2.298+0.441=2.739\n\nTotal γ² ≈ 18.384 + 2.739 = 21.123\n\nγ² -1 = 20.123\n\nsqrt(20.123) ≈ 4.486\n\nSo p = 938 * 4.486 ≈ 938 * 4 = 3752, 938 * 0.486 = 938*(0.4 + 0.08 + 0.006) = 938*0.4=375.2, 938*0.08=75.04, 938*0.006=5.628. Total 375.2+75.04=450.24 +5.628=455.868. So total p ≈ 3752 + 455.868 ≈ 4207.868 MeV/c ≈ 4208 MeV/c.\n\nBut the problem asks for the minimum value of the incident-beam proton momentum. So the answer is approximately 4208 MeV/c. But let's check if there's a more precise way. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation in γ +1. Let me recompute:\n\nΣm_final = 2150 + 2*494 = 2150 + 988 = 3138 MeV/c²\n\n(m_H + 2m_K)^2 = (3138)^2 = let's compute this more accurately:\n\n3138 * 3138:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n3000 * 3000 = 9,000,000\n\n3000 * 138 = 414,000\n\n138 * 3000 = 414,000\n\n138 * 138 = 19,044\n\nSo total is 9,000,000 + 414,000 + 414,000 + 19,044 = 9,000,000 + 828,000 + 19,044 = 9,847,044\n\nDenominator: 2 * (938)^2 = 2 * 879,844 = 1,759,688\n\nSo γ +1 = 9,847,044 / 1,759,688 ≈ 5.596\n\nYes, that's correct. So γ ≈4.596. Then p ≈ 938 * sqrt(4.596² -1) ≈ 938 * sqrt(20.123) ≈ 938 *4.486 ≈4208 MeV/c.\n\nBut perhaps the answer expects units in GeV/c. 4208 MeV/c is 4.208 GeV/c. But let's check if the calculation is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler formula. The threshold momentum can also be calculated using:\n\np_min = [ ( (m_H + 2m_K)^2 - (2m_p)^2 ) / (4m_p) ]^(1/2)\n\nWait, let's see. The threshold condition in the lab frame (target at rest) can be derived using conservation of energy and momentum. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet the incident proton have momentum p. Its energy is E_p = sqrt(p²c² + m_p²c^4). The target proton is at rest, so energy is m_p c². Total energy is E_total = sqrt(p²c² + m_p²c^4) + m_p c². Total momentum is p.\n\nIn the center-of-mass frame, the total energy must be at least the sum of the rest masses of the products: E_cm ≥ (m_H + 2m_K)c². The threshold is when E_cm = (m_H + 2m_K)c².\n\nThe total energy squared in the lab frame is s = (E_total)^2 - (p c)^2 = [sqrt(p²c² + m_p²c^4) + m_p c²]^2 - p²c²\n\nExpand this:\n\n= [p²c² + m_p²c^4 + 2 m_p c² sqrt(p²c² + m_p²c^4) + m_p²c^4] - p²c²\n\n= 2 m_p²c^4 + 2 m_p c² sqrt(p²c² + m_p²c^4)\n\nSet this equal to (m_H + 2m_K)^2 c^4:\n\n2 m_p²c^4 + 2 m_p c² sqrt(p²c² + m_p²c^4) = (m_H + 2m_K)^2 c^4\n\nDivide both sides by c^4:\n\n2 m_p² + 2 m_p sqrt(p² + m_p²) = (m_H + 2m_K)^2\n\nLet me denote m_p as m, m_H + 2m_K as M.\n\nSo:\n\n2 m² + 2 m sqrt(p² + m²) = M²\n\nSolve for sqrt(p² + m²):\n\nsqrt(p² + m²) = (M² - 2 m²)/(2 m)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\np² + m² = [ (M² - 2 m²)/(2 m) ]²\n\nThen:\n\np² = [ (M² - 2 m²)^2 / (4 m²) ] - m²\n\n= [ (M^4 - 4 M² m² + 4 m^4) / (4 m²) ] - m²\n\n= (M^4 - 4 M² m² + 4 m^4 - 4 m^4) / (4 m²)\n\n= (M^4 - 4 M² m²) / (4 m²)\n\n= M² (M² - 4 m²) / (4 m²)\n\nTake square root:\n\np = (M / (2 m)) sqrt(M² - 4 m²)\n\nBut M = m_H + 2m_K = 2150 + 2*494 = 3138 MeV/c²\n\nm = m_p = 938 MeV/c²\n\nSo:\n\np = (3138 / (2*938)) * sqrt(3138² - 4*(938)^2 )\n\nFirst compute 3138/(2*938) = 3138/1876 ≈ 1.673\n\nNow compute sqrt(3138² -4*938²):\n\n3138² = 9,847,044 (as before)\n\n4*938² = 4*879,844 = 3,519,376\n\nSo difference: 9,847,044 - 3,519,376 = 6,327,668\n\nsqrt(6,327,668) ≈ 2515.48 MeV/c²\n\nThen p ≈ 1.673 * 2515.48 ≈\n\n1.673 * 2500 = 4182.5\n\n1.673 * 15.48 ≈ 25.89\n\nTotal ≈ 4182.5 +25.89 ≈ 4208.39 MeV/c\n\nWhich matches the previous result. So the minimum momentum is approximately 4208 MeV/c, which is 4.208 GeV/c. But the problem might expect the answer in units of MeV/c, so 4208 MeV/c. However, let's check the exact value using precise calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is expected to be in GeV/c with more precise decimals, but given the approximated masses, 494 MeV for kaon, 938 for proton, the answer is approximately 4208 MeV/c. So boxed as \\boxed{4208 \\text{ MeV/c}} or \\boxed{4.21 \\text{ GeV/c}}. But the problem says \"minimum value of incident-beam proton momentum\", so likely in MeV/c. Given that the calculation gives approximately 4208 MeV/c, but let's check if the kaon mass is exactly 493.677 MeV/c², and proton is 938.272 MeV/c². Let's recalculate with more precise values.\n\nm_H = 2150 MeV\n\nm_K = 493.677 MeV\n\nm_p = 938.272 MeV\n\nΣm_final = 2150 + 2*493.677 = 2150 + 987.354 = 3137.354 MeV\n\nThen (Σm_final)^2 = (3137.354)^2 ≈ Let's compute this:\n\n3137.354^2 = (3000 + 137.354)^2 = 3000² + 2*3000*137.354 + 137.354²\n\n= 9,000,000 + 824,124 + (137.354)^2\n\nCompute 137.354^2:\n\n137^2 = 18,769\n\n0.354^2 ≈0.125\n\nCross term: 2*137*0.354 ≈ 97.0\n\nSo total ≈18,769 +97.0 +0.125 ≈18,866.125\n\nSo total Σm_final² ≈9,000,000 +824,124 +18,866.125 ≈9,842,990.125 (MeV²)\n\nDenominator: 2*m_p² = 2*(938.272)^2\n\nCompute 938.272^2:\n\n= (900 + 38.272)^2 = 900² + 2*900*38.272 +38.272²\n\n= 810,000 + 68,889.6 + 1,464.7 ≈810,000 +68,889.6=878,889.6 +1,464.7≈880,354.3\n\nMultiply by 2: 1,760,708.6 MeV²\n\nThen γ +1 = 9,842,990.125 / 1,760,708.6 ≈5.59 (exact value?)\n\nDivide 9,842,990.125 /1,760,708.6:\n\nApproximately 9,842,990 /1,760,708 ≈5.59 (same as before)\n\nSo γ ≈5.59 -1=4.59\n\nThen p = m_p * sqrt(γ² -1) =938.272 * sqrt(4.59² -1)\n\nCompute 4.59²=21.0681, so sqrt(21.0681 -1)=sqrt(20.0681)=4.48\n\nSo p≈938.272 *4.48≈\n\n938 *4=3752\n\n938*0.48=450.24\n\n0.272*4=1.088\n\n0.272*0.48≈0.13056\n\nTotal≈3752 +450.24 +1.088 +0.13056≈3752+450.24=4202.24 +1.088=4203.328 +0.13056≈4203.458 MeV/c\n\nBut this is with more precise masses. However, the approximate answer is around 4200 MeV/c. Given that the problem gives m_H as 2150 MeV, which is precise, but m_K and m_p are not specified, so using approximate values is acceptable. Therefore, the answer is approximately 4200 MeV/c. But my earlier calculation with approximate masses gave 4208 MeV/c. Depending on rounding, the answer could be 4210 MeV/c or 4200 MeV/c. However, given that the precise calculation with more accurate masses gave around 4203 MeV/c, but the problem might expect the answer as 4208 MeV/c. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 4208 MeV/c. Let's go with 4208 MeV/c.\n\nFor part (c): If the mass prediction is correct, what can we say about the possible decay modes of H? Consider both strong and weak decays.\n\nH is a dibaryon with baryon number +2. Its possible decays depend on its mass and quantum numbers. Since its mass is 2150 MeV, let's compare to possible decay products.\n\nPossible decay channels would be to particles with total baryon number +2. For example, two baryons (each with B=+1), or a dibaryon and mesons, but dibaryons are rare. More likely, it would decay into two baryons plus mesons if necessary.\n\nBut the mass of H is 2150 MeV. Let's see the mass of two protons: 2*938 = 1876 MeV. So H is heavier than two protons. Alternatively, two neutrons: similar. But H could decay into two baryons plus mesons. For example, H → pp + mesons, or H → pΛK, etc., depending on quantum numbers.\n\nBut since H has baryon number +2, charge 0, strangeness -2. Let's consider possible decays.\n\nStrong decays: If H can decay via strong interaction, it would have a very short lifetime (~10^-23 s). For a strong decay, the process must conserve all quantum numbers: charge, baryon number, strangeness (but wait, strong interactions do not conserve strangeness). Wait, in strong decays, strangeness is not conserved. So H could decay into particles with different strangeness. However, the initial H has S=-2. For example, H could decay into Ξ⁻ + Ξ⁻ + something? Wait, Ξ⁻ has S=-2 each. But H has S=-2. So two Ξ⁻ would have total S=-4, which doesn't match. Alternatively, H → Λ + Λ + K⁺ + K⁺. Each Λ has S=-1, so two Λ give S=-2, and two K⁺ give S=+2, total S=0. But H has S=-2. So that doesn't conserve strangeness. But strong interaction doesn't require conservation of strangeness. However, the decay products must have the same baryon number and charge as H.\n\nH has B=+2, Q=0. So possible strong decay channels:\n\n- Two baryons with total B=+2 and Q=0. For example, pp (charge +2, so no), Σ⁰ Σ⁰ (each Σ⁰ is neutral, B=1, S=-1). So two Σ⁰ would have B=2, Q=0, S=-2. That matches H's quantum numbers. So H → Σ⁰ Σ⁰. Check masses: Σ⁰ mass is about 1192 MeV/c². Two Σ⁰ would be 2384 MeV, which is more than H's mass of 2150 MeV. So that's not possible. Therefore, H cannot decay strongly into Σ⁰ Σ⁰.\n\nAnother possibility: H → Λ Λ. Each Λ has B=1, S=-1, Q=0. Two Λs give B=2, Q=0, S=-2. That matches H's quantum numbers. The mass of two Λs is 2*1116 = 2232 MeV, which is higher than H's mass of 2150 MeV. So this decay is not possible due to mass constraint.\n\nAnother option: H → Ξ⁰ Ξ⁰. Each Ξ⁰ has B=1, S=-2, Q=0. Two Ξ⁰s give B=2, Q=0, S=-4. Doesn't match H's S=-2. So no.\n\nAlternatively, H → p Σ⁻ K⁺. Let's check quantum numbers. p: B=1, Q=+1, S=0. Σ⁻: B=1, Q=-1, S=-1. K⁺: B=0, Q=+1, S=+1. Total B=2, Q=+1 -1 +1=+1. Doesn't match H's Q=0. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, H → n Σ⁰ K⁰. n: B=1, Q=0. Σ⁰: B=1, Q=0. K⁰: B=0, Q=0. Total B=2, Q=0. Strangeness: n has S=0, Σ⁰ S=-1, K⁰ S=+1. Total S=0. H has S=-2. Doesn't match. But strong interaction doesn't conserve S. However, the mass of n + Σ⁰ + K⁰ is about 940 + 1192 + 498 = 2630 MeV, which is higher than H's mass. So not possible.\n\nAlternatively, H → Λ p K⁰. B=1+1=2, Q=0+0=0. S=-1 +0 +1=0. H has S=-2. Mass: 1116 +938 +498≈2552 MeV. Too heavy.\n\nAlternatively, H → Σ⁺ Σ⁻. Σ⁺ has B=1, Q=+1, S=-1. Σ⁻ has B=1, Q=-1, S=-1. Total B=2, Q=0, S=-2. This matches H's quantum numbers. The mass of Σ⁺ is 1189 MeV, Σ⁻ is 1197 MeV. Total ≈1189 +1197=2386 MeV, which is higher than 2150 MeV. So not possible.\n\nTherefore, there are no strong decay channels available for H into two baryons, because the combined mass of any two baryons with appropriate quantum numbers exceeds H's mass. Therefore, H cannot decay via the strong interaction. \n\nWhat about weak decays? Weak decays can change strangeness, but they are slower. For example, H could decay weakly into particles with different strangeness. However, the weak interaction allows for changes in strangeness by ±1, 0. For example, H could decay into two baryons with a total strangeness different from -2, plus mesons. But since H has B=2, the decay must produce two baryons plus mesons. For example, H → pp + something. Let's check.\n\nH → pp + K⁻ K⁻. Each K⁻ has S=-1. Two K⁻ give S=-2. So total S=0 (pp have S=0). But H has S=-2. So this would require a change in strangeness by +2, which is possible via weak interaction (ΔS=±2 is allowed in weak interactions, but rare). However, the mass of pp + K⁻ K⁻ is 2*938 + 2*494 = 1876 + 988 = 2864 MeV, which is way above 2150 MeV. Not possible.\n\nAlternatively, H → Λ Λ. As before, but mass too high. Or H → Ξ⁻ p + mesons. Ξ⁻ has S=-2, p has S=0. Total S=-2. So H → Ξ⁻ p + something. Let's see. Ξ⁻ mass is 1321 MeV, p is 938. Total 1321 +938=2259 MeV, which is more than 2150. So not possible.\n\nAlternatively, H could decay via weak interaction into a neutron and a Σ⁻ and a K⁺: n Σ⁻ K⁺. Check quantum numbers: B=1+1=2, Q=0 + (-1) +1=0. S=0 + (-1) +1=0. H has S=-2.

{"id": "atomic/3-10", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the correct lifetime of a muon from the given options: 10^9, 10^2, 10^-2, or 10^-6 seconds. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about muons.\n\nMuons are elementary particles similar to electrons but much heavier. I remember that they're unstable and decay into other particles, so their lifetime is relatively short. But wait, how short exactly? I think the actual value is on the order of microseconds. Let me think... a microsecond is 10^-6 seconds. So maybe 10^-6 seconds is the right answer here. \n\nWait, but I also recall something about cosmic rays and time dilation. When muons are created in the upper atmosphere by cosmic rays, they travel towards the Earth's surface. Even though their lifetime is short, they can reach the ground because of relativistic effects. But that's about their observed lifetime from our frame of reference. Their proper lifetime, meaning the lifetime measured in their rest frame, should still be around 2.2 microseconds. So 2.2 x 10^-6 seconds. But the options here are 10^-6, which is close. The options given don't have 2.2, but 10^-6 is the closest. So maybe the answer is 10^-6 seconds.\n\nWait, but wait another second. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up numbers. Let me check my memory. The muon's average lifetime is approximately 2.2 microseconds. So 2.2 x 10^-6 seconds. But the options here are 10^-6. So perhaps the question is approximating it as 10^-6? Or maybe the actual value is around 1e-6? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing it with another particle. Let me think. Tau particles have even shorter lifetimes, but muons are longer-lived than tau. Pions, maybe? Neutral pions decay much faster. Charged pions have longer lifetimes, but muons... yes, muon's lifetime is about 2.2e-6 seconds. So the closest option here is 10^-6. So the answer should be 10^-6 seconds. The other options are way off. 10^9 seconds is like decades, 10^2 is 100 seconds, which is way too long. 10^-2 is a hundredth of a second, which is still longer than microseconds. So yeah, 10^-6 is the right choice here.\n</think>\n\nThe muon's average lifetime is approximately \\(2.2 \\times 10^{-6}\\) seconds.

{"id": "atomic/4-38", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The problem says that two photons with energies ε and E collide head-on, and we need to find the velocity β of the coordinate system where the total momentum is zero. Hmm, so this is about finding the frame where the momenta of the two photons cancel each other out. \n\nPhotons have energy and momentum related by E = pc, right? Since they're massless. So the momentum of each photon would be p = E/c for the first one and p = ε/c for the second. But wait, since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta vectors will be opposite. Let me think. If they collide head-on, their momenta are in opposite directions. So in the lab frame, one photon is moving in the positive direction, say the x-direction, and the other in the negative x-direction. \n\nSo the total momentum before collision would be (E/c) - (ε/c), assuming the first photon is moving in the positive direction and the second in the negative. Wait, but if they're colliding head-on, maybe their directions are opposite. Let me clarify. Suppose in the original frame, one photon has energy E moving to the right, and the other has energy ε moving to the left. Then their momenta are E/c to the right and ε/c to the left. So total momentum is (E/c - ε/c) to the right. \n\nBut we need to find a frame where the total momentum is zero. That frame is the center-of-momentum frame. So we need to boost into a frame moving with velocity β such that the total momentum is zero. \n\nTo find β, we can use the Lorentz transformation for momentum and energy. When we change frames, the momentum and energy of each photon will transform. Alternatively, maybe we can use the formula for the velocity of the center-of-momentum frame. \n\nIn general, for two particles with energies E1, E2 and momenta p1, p2, the velocity of the center-of-momentum frame is given by β = (p1 + p2)c / (E1 + E2). Wait, no. Wait, the total momentum in the original frame is p_total = p1 - p2 (since they are in opposite directions). Then, the velocity of the COM frame is such that when you boost by β, the total momentum becomes zero. \n\nAlternatively, the velocity of the center-of-momentum frame can be calculated by β = (E1 v1 + E2 v2)/(E1 + E2), but since photons have v = c, but their directions are opposite. Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. \n\nWait, for photons, the momentum is E/c, and the direction is along their motion. So if one photon has momentum p1 = E/c to the right, and the other p2 = ε/c to the left, then total momentum is p_total = (E/c - ε/c) to the right. \n\nThe total energy is E_total = E + ε. \n\nIn the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum must be zero. The velocity β of this frame relative to the original frame can be found using the Lorentz transformation. The momentum in the new frame is given by:\n\np' = γ(p - β E / c)\n\nBut since in the COM frame, the total momentum p' = 0. So for each photon, their transformed momenta must sum to zero. \n\nWait, but photons are massless, so their energy and momentum are related by E = |p|c. Let me denote the two photons as photon 1 (energy E, moving to the right) and photon 2 (energy ε, moving to the left). \n\nIn the original frame, their momenta are p1 = E/c to the right, p2 = ε/c to the left. So total momentum is p_total = (E - ε)/c to the right. \n\nThe total energy is E_total = E + ε. \n\nThe velocity β of the COM frame is given by β = (total momentum * c) / total energy. Wait, that might be the case. Let me recall that for a system of particles, the velocity of the COM frame is (Σ p_i c) / (Σ E_i). \n\nYes, in general, the velocity of the center-of-momentum frame is (P_total c) / (E_total), where P_total is the total momentum. \n\nSo here, P_total = (E - ε)/c (since p1 - p2 = (E/c - ε/c)), so P_total c = E - ε. Then, β = (E - ε)/(E + ε). \n\nThat's exactly the formula given in part (a). So that's the answer. \n\nWait, but let me verify this. Let's suppose that in the original frame, the total momentum is (E - ε)/c. Then, the velocity of the COM frame is β = (P_total c) / (E_total) = (E - ε)/(E + ε). That's correct. \n\nSo part (a) is straightforward once you recall that the velocity of the center-of-momentum frame is given by the total momentum times c divided by the total energy. \n\nNow moving to part (b). The question is: if the colliding photons are to produce an electron-positron pair, and ε is 1 eV, what must be the minimum value of the energy E? \n\nHmm, pair production (electron and positron) requires that the total energy in the center-of-momentum frame is at least twice the rest mass energy of the electron, which is 2 * 0.511 MeV. Because the rest mass of the electron (and positron) is about 0.511 MeV/c². So the total energy in the COM frame must be at least 2 * 0.511 MeV. \n\nBut the photons are colliding, and in their COM frame, the total energy must be at least the sum of the rest masses. Since photons are massless, their COM energy is the total invariant mass of the system. \n\nThe invariant mass squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2. Wait, because the photons are moving in opposite directions. Let me compute the invariant mass. \n\nThe invariant mass squared s = (E_total c)^2 - (p_total c^2)^2. \n\nE_total = E + ε. \n\np_total c^2 = (E/c - ε/c) c^2 = (E - ε) c. \n\nSo s = (E + ε)^2 c^2 - (E - ε)^2 c^2. \n\nExpanding this: \n\ns = [ (E + ε)^2 - (E - ε)^2 ] c^2 \n\n= [ (E² + 2 E ε + ε²) - (E² - 2 E ε + ε²) ] c^2 \n\n= [4 E ε] c^2 \n\nSo the invariant mass squared is 4 E ε c². Therefore, the invariant mass is 2 sqrt(E ε) c. \n\nWait, but the invariant mass must be at least 2 m_e c², since we need to create two electrons (electron and positron). So:\n\n2 sqrt(E ε) c ≥ 2 m_e c² \n\nDivide both sides by 2 c:\n\nsqrt(E ε) ≥ m_e c \n\nSquare both sides:\n\nE ε ≥ (m_e c²)^2 \n\nSo E ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / ε \n\nGiven that ε is 1 eV, and m_e c² is approximately 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV. \n\nTherefore, E ≥ (511,000 eV)^2 / 1 eV = (511,000)^2 eV = 511,000 * 511,000 eV \n\nCalculating that: 511,000 * 511,000 = (5.11 * 10^5)^2 = 26.1121 * 10^10 eV = 2.61121 * 10^11 eV \n\nBut 1 TeV is 10^12 eV, so this is approximately 0.2611 TeV, or 261.1 GeV. \n\nWait, but 511,000 eV is 0.511 MeV. So (0.511 MeV)^2 / 1 eV = (0.511)^2 (MeV)^2 / eV \n\nBut 1 MeV = 10^6 eV, so (MeV)^2 = 10^12 (eV)^2. Therefore:\n\n(0.511)^2 * 10^12 eV² / 1 eV = 0.261121 * 10^12 eV = 2.61121 * 10^11 eV = 261.121 GeV \n\nSo the minimum energy E is approximately 261 GeV. \n\nBut wait, let me check the calculation again. \n\nm_e c² = 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV \n\nSo (m_e c²)^2 = (511,000 eV)^2 = 511,000 * 511,000 eV² \n\nThen, E = (m_e c²)^2 / ε \n\nSince ε is 1 eV, then E = (511,000)^2 eV² / 1 eV = 511,000^2 eV \n\nCompute 511,000 squared: \n\n511 * 10^3 squared is (511)^2 * 10^6 \n\n511^2 = (500 + 11)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*11 + 11^2 = 250,000 + 11,000 + 121 = 261,121 \n\nSo 261,121 * 10^6 eV = 261,121 MeV = 261.121 GeV \n\nSo E must be at least approximately 261 GeV. \n\nBut wait, that seems extremely high. Is that correct? Because pair production from photon-photon collisions usually requires that the product of their energies is at least (m_e c²)^2. Since one photon is 1 eV, the other must be (0.511 MeV)^2 / 1 eV = 0.511^2 * 10^12 eV² / eV = 0.261 * 10^12 eV = 2.61 * 10^11 eV = 261 GeV. \n\nYes, that seems right. Because the threshold condition is that the invariant mass must be at least 2 m_e c². The invariant mass squared is 4 E ε, so 4 E ε ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2 → 4 E ε ≥ 4 m_e² c^4 → E ε ≥ m_e² c^4. \n\nTherefore, E ≥ m_e² c^4 / ε. \n\nSince m_e c² is 0.511 MeV, then m_e² c^4 is (0.511 MeV)^2. So E ≥ (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1 eV) \n\nConvert MeV to eV: 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV. So (511,000 eV)^2 / 1 eV = 511,000^2 eV = 261,121,000,000 eV = 261.121 GeV. \n\nSo the minimum energy E is approximately 261 GeV. \n\nBut wait, is there a mistake here? Because when two photons collide, the threshold condition is indeed when their invariant mass equals twice the electron mass. The invariant mass squared s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2. Since photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. Let me recheck the invariant mass calculation. \n\nFor two photons moving in opposite directions along the x-axis, their four-momenta are (E1/c, E1/c, 0, 0) and (E2/c, -E2/c, 0, 0). \n\nThe total four-momentum is ( (E1 + E2)/c, (E1 - E2)/c, 0, 0 ). \n\nThe invariant mass squared is (total energy/c)^2 - (total momentum)^2. \n\nSo s = ( (E1 + E2)/c )^2 - ( (E1 - E2)/c )^2 \n\n= [ (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 ] / c^2 \n\n= [4 E1 E2] / c^2 \n\nTherefore, s = 4 E1 E2 / c^2 \n\nBut the invariant mass squared must be at least (2 m_e c^2)^2. So:\n\n4 E1 E2 / c^2 ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2 \n\nMultiply both sides by c^2:\n\n4 E1 E2 ≥ 4 m_e^2 c^6 \n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nE1 E2 ≥ m_e^2 c^6 \n\nWait, but energy has units of Joules, and m_e c^2 has units of Joules. Wait, maybe there's a unit inconsistency here. Let me check the units. \n\nWait, four-momentum for a photon is (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z). The invariant mass squared is (sum E/c)^2 - (sum p_x c)^2 - ... \n\nWait, actually, the invariant mass squared is (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2. \n\nSo for two photons, sum E = E1 + E2. Sum p c = (p1 c - p2 c) since they are in opposite directions. But p1 = E1 / c, p2 = E2 / c. So sum p c = (E1 - E2). \n\nTherefore, invariant mass squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2. \n\nSo s = 4 E1 E2. \n\nThe invariant mass is sqrt(s) = 2 sqrt(E1 E2). \n\nThis must be at least 2 m_e c^2. So:\n\n2 sqrt(E1 E2) ≥ 2 m_e c^2 \n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nsqrt(E1 E2) ≥ m_e c^2 \n\nSquare both sides:\n\nE1 E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2 \n\nSo yes, the product of the energies must be at least (m_e c^2)^2. \n\nGiven that one photon has energy ε = 1 eV, the other must have energy E such that E * 1 eV ≥ (0.511 MeV)^2. \n\nConvert 0.511 MeV to eV: 0.511 * 10^6 eV = 511,000 eV. \n\nSo (511,000 eV)^2 = 511,000^2 eV². \n\nTherefore, E ≥ 511,000^2 eV² / 1 eV = 511,000^2 eV = 261,121,000,000 eV = 261.121 GeV. \n\nSo the minimum energy E is approximately 261 GeV. \n\nThat seems correct. Even though it's a very high energy, it's because one photon is very low energy (1 eV), so the other has to compensate to reach the necessary invariant mass. \n\nSo part (b)'s answer is E_min = (m_e c²)^2 / ε = (0.511 MeV)^2 / 1 eV = approximately 261 GeV.\n</think>\n\n(a) To find the velocity \\(\\beta\\) of the coordinate system where the total momentum of the two colliding photons is zero, we use the relation for the center-of-momentum (COM) frame velocity.

{"id": "atomic/3-17", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out why these reactions and decays aren't observed. Let's start with part (a), the reactions. Each of these involves protons and neutrons colliding to produce various particles. The key here is probably conservation laws. Since the question mentions that even with several BeV kinetic energy, which I think is billion electron volts, the reactions don't happen. So maybe it's not about energy but about some other conservation rules like baryon number, strangeness, charge, or something else.\n\nLooking at reaction 1: p + p → K⁺ + Σ⁺. Let's check the conservation laws. Baryon number: protons are baryons (B=1 each), so total initial B is 1+1=2. On the right, K⁺ is a meson (B=0), Σ⁺ is a baryon (B=1). So total B is 0 +1=1. Wait, that's a problem. Baryon number isn't conserved here. Initial B=2, final B=1. So that's a violation. Therefore, this reaction can't happen because baryon number isn't conserved.\n\nReaction 2: p + n → Λ⁰ + Σ⁺. Let's check baryon number again. p and n are both B=1, so total B=2. Λ⁰ and Σ⁺ are both B=1 each. So total B=2. Okay, that's conserved. Charge: p is +1, n is 0. Total charge +1. On the right, Λ⁰ is neutral, Σ⁺ is +1. Total charge +1. Charge is conserved. What about strangeness? The initial particles (p and n) have S=0. The Λ⁰ has S=-1, Σ⁺ has S=-1. So total S on the right is -2. But initial S=0. Strangeness isn't conserved. However, in strong interactions, strangeness isn't conserved. But these reactions are probably strong interactions since they involve protons and neutrons colliding. Wait, but production of strange particles (like K, Λ, Σ) usually involves associated production, where strangeness is conserved in the strong interaction? Wait, no. Wait, in strong interactions, strangeness can change. Wait, no. Wait, the strong interaction does conserve strangeness. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the strong interaction conserves strangeness. But particles like K mesons have strangeness. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me recall: the strong force conserves strangeness. But in reactions mediated by the strong force (like typical particle collisions), strangeness doesn't have to be conserved. Wait, no. Wait, in the strong interaction, strangeness is conserved. But in weak interactions, it's not. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the strong interaction does not conserve strangeness. Wait, no, that's not right. The conservation of strangeness is a concept from the 1950s when they noticed that some particles (like kaons) were produced in pairs, suggesting that their production (via strong interaction) conserved strangeness. So in strong interactions, strangeness is conserved, but in weak interactions, it can change. So if the reaction is via the strong force, then strangeness must be conserved. But in this case, the initial particles (p and n) have S=0. The products are Λ⁰ (S=-1) and Σ⁺ (S=-1). Total S=-2. So the reaction would require a change in strangeness from 0 to -2. Since the strong interaction conserves strangeness, this reaction can't proceed via the strong force. But maybe via the weak force? But the weak force is much slower, so the reaction would be very unlikely. Hence, even if there's enough energy, the reaction isn't observed because it violates strangeness conservation in the strong interaction, which is necessary for such a reaction to proceed quickly.\n\nReaction 3: p + n → Ξ⁰ + p. Let's check. Baryon number: initial is 1+1=2. On the right, Ξ⁰ has B=1, and p has B=1. Total B=2. Charge: left is +1 +0 = +1. Right: Ξ⁰ is neutral, p is +1. Total +1. Charge conserved. Strangeness: initial S=0. Ξ⁰ has S=-2. Proton has S=0. So total S=-2. So initial S=0, final S=-2. Strangeness isn't conserved. Again, if this is a strong interaction, which it would need to be for such a reaction to happen, but since strangeness isn't conserved, it's not allowed. So the reaction can't proceed via strong interaction. Weak interaction would allow it, but the probability is too low, so it's not observed.\n\nReaction 4: p + n → Ξ⁻ + K⁺ + Σ⁺. Let's check. Baryon number: initial 2. Ξ⁻ (B=1), Σ⁺ (B=1), K⁺ (B=0). Total B=1+1=2. Charge: initial +1 +0 = +1. Right side: Ξ⁻ (-1), K⁺ (+1), Σ⁺ (+1). Total charge: -1 +1 +1 = +1. Charge conserved. Strangeness: initial S=0. Ξ⁻ has S=-2, K⁺ has S=+1, Σ⁺ has S=-1. Total S= -2 +1 -1 = -2. So initial S=0, final S=-2. Again, strangeness not conserved. So same issue as before. Strong interaction requires S conservation, so this reaction can't proceed via strong. Weak interaction is too slow, so not observed.\n\nSo for part (a), all the reactions violate strangeness conservation in the strong interaction, which is necessary for such reactions to occur. Hence, they aren't observed even with high energy.\n\nNow part (b), the decay processes. Decays are usually governed by the conservation laws. Let's check each decay.\n\n1. Ξ⁰ → Σ⁰ + Λ⁰. Let's check baryon number: Ξ⁰ has B=1. Σ⁰ and Λ⁰ each have B=1. So total B=2. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, no: decay of a particle must conserve baryon number. Ξ⁰ (B=1) → Σ⁰ (B=1) + Λ⁰ (B=1). So total B on the right is 1+1=2. But initial B=1. So baryon number isn't conserved. Therefore, this decay is impossible. But wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, the decay is Ξ⁰ (B=1) → Σ⁰ (B=1) + Λ⁰ (B=1). So total B on the right is 2. But initial B is 1. So that's a violation. Hence, this decay is impossible because baryon number isn't conserved. So that's why it's not observed.\n\n2. Σ⁺ → Λ⁰ + K⁺. Check conservation laws. Baryon number: Σ⁺ (B=1) → Λ⁰ (B=1) + K⁺ (B=0). So B is conserved. Charge: Σ⁺ is +1. Λ⁰ is 0, K⁺ is +1. Total charge +1. Conserved. Strangeness: Σ⁺ has S=-1. Λ⁰ has S=-1, K⁺ has S=+1. Total S on right: -1 +1 = 0. Initial S=-1. So strangeness changes from -1 to 0. But in decays, if it's a weak decay, strangeness can change. Wait, but Σ⁺ is a hyperon, which typically decays via the weak interaction. So maybe other conservation laws. Let's check other quantum numbers like charm, bottom, etc., but probably not relevant here. Let's check the spin. Σ⁺ has spin 1/2, Λ⁰ has spin 1/2, K⁺ has spin 0. So total spin on the right could be 1/2 (since 1/2 + 0). So spin is okay. What about lepton numbers? Not involved here. Maybe energy? Let's check masses. Σ⁺ mass is about 1189 MeV/c². Λ⁰ is about 1116 MeV/c². K⁺ is about 494 MeV/c². Total mass on the right: 1116 + 494 = 1610 MeV/c². But Σ⁺ is only 1189. So the decay is not possible because the mass of the products is larger than the parent. Wait, that's a key point. If the rest mass of the decay products is greater than the parent's mass, the decay can't happen due to energy conservation. So Σ⁺ (1189) → Λ⁰ (1116) + K⁺ (494). Sum of the masses is 1116 + 494 = 1610 MeV, which is way more than 1189. So the decay is energetically forbidden. Hence, it's not observed.\n\n3. Ξ⁻ → n + π⁻. Check conservation. Baryon number: Ξ⁻ has B=1. n has B=1, π⁻ has B=0. So B conserved. Charge: Ξ⁻ is -1. n is 0, π⁻ is -1. Total charge -1. Conserved. Strangeness: Ξ⁻ has S=-2. n and π⁻ have S=0. So total S on right is 0. So strangeness changes from -2 to 0. But in weak decays, strangeness can change. However, maybe there's another conservation law. Let's check mass. Ξ⁻ mass is about 1321 MeV/c². Neutron is 940, π⁻ is 140. Total right side: 940 +140=1080. So parent mass is 1321, which is more than 1080. So energy-wise, it's allowed. So why isn't this decay observed? Maybe another quantum number. Let's check the quark content. Ξ⁻ is s s d. Decaying into n (u d d) and π⁻ (d ū). Let's see: Ξ⁻ (ssd) → n (udd) + π⁻ (dū). The s quarks would need to be converted. In weak decays, s quarks can change. But maybe there's a rule about the change in strangeness. The decay Ξ⁻ → n + π⁻ would require a change in strangeness by +2 (since Ξ⁻ has S=-2, and products have S=0). In weak interactions, the change in strangeness is typically ΔS=±1. So this decay would have ΔS=+2, which is not allowed in weak interactions. Hence, the decay is forbidden by the ΔS=±1 rule in weak decays. Therefore, it's not observed.\n\n4. Λ⁰ → K⁺ + K⁻. Check conservation. Baryon number: Λ⁰ (B=1) → K⁺ (0) + K⁻ (0). So B=1 → 0. Baryon number not conserved. Hence, impossible. So this decay violates baryon number conservation. Therefore, it's not observed.\n\n5. Ξ⁰ → p + π⁻. Check. Baryon number: Ξ⁰ (B=1) → p (B=1) + π⁻ (B=0). B conserved. Charge: Ξ⁰ is 0 → p (+1) + π⁻ (-1). Total charge 0. Conserved. Strangeness: Ξ⁰ has S=-2. p and π⁻ have S=0. So ΔS=+2. Again, in weak decays, ΔS can only be ±1. So this decay would require ΔS=+2, which is not allowed. Hence, the decay is forbidden by the ΔS=±1 rule. Therefore, not observed.\n\nSo summarizing part (b):\n\n1. Baryon number violation.\n\n2. Mass of decay products exceeds parent mass.\n\n3. ΔS=+2 in weak decay (ΔS must be ±1).\n\n4. Baryon number violation.\n\n5. ΔS=+2 (from -2 to 0), which is ΔS=+2, not allowed.\n</think>\n\n(a) The reactions are not observed due to violations of conservation laws, primarily strangeness (S) in strong interactions:\n\n1. **$p

{"id": "atomic/3-28", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these questions one by one. Starting with part (a): What is the strangeness of the Σ*? Hmm. The problem mentions the reactions K⁻ p → π⁻ Σ*⁺ and that K⁺ p → π⁺ Σ*⁺ doesn't occur. I need to figure out the strangeness based on these reactions.\n\nFirst, I remember that strangeness is a quantum number conserved in strong interactions. Since these reactions are likely strong (they involve hadrons and mesons), the strangeness should be conserved. Let's check the initial and final states for each reaction.\n\nFor the first reaction: K⁻ p → π⁻ Σ*⁺. Let's break down the particles. The K⁻ meson has a strangeness S = -1. The proton (p) is a baryon with S = 0. So the total initial strangeness is -1 + 0 = -1.\n\nOn the right side, π⁻ has S = 0, and Σ*⁺ is the particle in question. So total final strangeness is 0 + S(Σ*⁺). Since strangeness is conserved in strong interactions, the total before and after must be equal. Therefore, -1 = 0 + S(Σ*⁺), so S(Σ*⁺) = -1. That would mean the Σ* has strangeness -1.\n\nNow, the second reaction K⁺ p → π⁺ Σ*⁺ doesn't occur. Let's check why. K⁺ has S = +1. Proton S=0. Initial total S = +1. Final state: π⁺ (S=0) and Σ*⁺. If Σ*⁺ had S=-1, then total final S would be 0 + (-1) = -1, which doesn't match initial +1. So the reaction is not allowed, which explains why it doesn't occur. That confirms that Σ*⁺ has S=-1. So part (a) answer is strangeness -1.\n\nMoving to part (b): Is the decay of Σ* strong or weak? The decay given is Σ* → π⁺ Λ. The decay width is Γ=35 MeV. Decay width relates to the lifetime via Γ = ħ/τ. A larger Γ means shorter lifetime. Strong decays typically have very short lifetimes (large Γ), while weak decays have smaller Γ (longer lifetimes). For example, typical strong decay widths are tens to hundreds of MeV, while weak decays are much smaller (like keV or MeV for some). Here, Γ=35 MeV is in the range of a strong interaction. Also, the decay products are a pion (meson) and Λ hyperon. The Λ has S=-1, and pion S=0. The Σ* has S=-1. So strangeness is conserved here: initial S=-1, final S=0 (pion) + (-1) (Λ) = -1. So strangeness conserved, which is a sign of strong interaction. Therefore, the decay is strong.\n\nPart (c): What is the isospin of Σ*? To find isospin, we can look at the decay channels and production reactions. The Σ* decays into π⁺ Λ. The pion has isospin I=1, and Λ has I=0. So the product has total isospin from combining I=1 and I=0. The possible total I would be 1 (since 1⊗0 =1). If the decay conserves isospin (as strong decays should), then the Σ* must have I=1. Alternatively, looking at the production reaction K⁻ p → π⁻ Σ*⁺. The initial particles: K⁻ is part of the isospin doublet (K⁰, K⁺) with I=1/2, but K⁻ is the anti-particle of K⁺, so maybe in terms of isospin, K⁻ has I=1/2 but with a certain component. The proton is part of the nucleon doublet (I=1/2). The reaction products are π⁻ (I=1, I3=-1) and Σ*⁺. Let's consider the isospin coupling. The initial state: K⁻ (I=1/2, I3=-1/2?) Wait, maybe I need to recall the isospin assignments. For mesons: pions form an I=1 triplet. Kaons: K⁺ is (I=1/2, I3=+1/2), K⁰ is (I=1/2, I3=-1/2). The anti-K's would be K⁻ (anti-K⁺: I=1/2, I3=-1/2) and anti-K⁰ (I=1/2, I3=+1/2). So K⁻ has I=1/2, I3=-1/2. The proton is (I=1/2, I3=+1/2). So combining K⁻ (I=1/2, I3=-1/2) and proton (I=1/2, I3=+1/2). The total isospin can be I=0 or I=1. Let's compute the possible I3: -1/2 +1/2 =0. So possible I=0 with I3=0 or I=1 with I3=0. The products are π⁻ (I=1, I3=-1) and Σ*⁺. Let's assume Σ* is an isospin multiplet. If Σ* has I=1, then Σ*⁺ would be part of a triplet with I3=+1, 0, -1. But the charge of Σ*⁺ is +1. Let's see: For the Σ (non-star), the Σ particles form an I=1 triplet: Σ⁺ (I3=+1), Σ⁰ (I3=0), Σ⁻ (I3=-1). Similarly, if Σ* is also I=1, then Σ*⁺ would have I3=+1. Then the product π⁻ (I3=-1) and Σ*⁺ (I3=+1) would have total I3=0. The initial state's possible I=0 (I3=0) or I=1 (I3=0). So the product must have I=1 (since π is I=1 and Σ* is I=1, their combination can be I=0,1,2). Wait, but the initial state could be I=0 or I=1. For the reaction to proceed, the isospin must be allowed. If the production reaction K⁻ p → π⁻ Σ*⁺ is allowed, then the isospin coupling must match. Let's see: The initial state (K⁻ and p) has possible I=0 or I=1. The final state (π⁻ and Σ*⁺) would have π⁻ (I=1, I3=-1) and Σ*⁺ (assuming I=1, I3=+1). The total I3 of the final state is -1 +1 =0. The total isospin of the final state can be obtained by combining I=1 (π) and I=1 (Σ*). The possible total I here would be 0,1,2. So the final state can have I=0,1,2 with I3=0. The initial state has possible I=0 (I3=0) or I=1 (I3=0). So if the reaction is allowed, there must be an overlap between the initial and final isospin states. If the initial state has I=0, then the final state must have I=0. But the final state's possible I=0,1,2. So if the initial is I=0, the final must have I=0 component. Alternatively, if initial is I=1, then the final must have I=1 component. For the reaction to proceed, there must be a matching. Let's suppose that the amplitude is non-zero only if the initial and final isospin states match. If the reaction occurs, then the initial isospin must match the final. Let's assume that the Σ* has I=1. Then the final state is π (I=1) and Σ* (I=1). Combining these, the total I can be 0,1,2. The initial state has possible I=0 or 1. So if the initial state is I=1, then the final state can have I=1 (if the combination is I=1). Therefore, the reaction can proceed if the initial is I=1. Alternatively, if the initial is I=0, the final must have I=0. But the final can only have I=0 if the combination of π and Σ* can form I=0. If Σ* is I=1 and π is I=1, then their combination can have I=0 (if coupled antisymmetrically?), but that's possible. However, the production reaction is allowed, so perhaps the initial state has I=1, leading to final state I=1. Alternatively, maybe the cross-section depends on the isospin. But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, since the reaction K⁻ p → π⁻ Σ*⁺ is allowed, but K⁺ p → π⁺ Σ*⁺ is not, perhaps this is due to isospin considerations. Let's compare the two reactions. For K⁺ p → π⁺ Σ*⁺: K⁺ has I=1/2, I3=+1/2. Proton is I=1/2, I3=+1/2. So total I3= +1. The possible total I is 1 (since 1/2 +1/2 can be I=1 or I=0). The final state is π⁺ (I=1, I3=+1) and Σ*⁺ (if Σ* is I=1, then I3=+1). So total I3= +1 +1= +2. The initial state's maximum I3 is +1 (if I=1, I3=+1). But the final state has I3=+2, which can't be reached from initial I3=+1. Therefore, the reaction is impossible, which matches the problem statement. So this suggests that the Σ* must have I=1. Because if Σ* had a different isospin, maybe this reasoning wouldn't hold. So putting it together: Σ* has isospin I=1. Therefore, the answer to (c) is isospin 1.\n</think>\n\n(a) The strangeness of the $\\Sigma^{*+}$ is **$-1$**.  \n**Explanation:** In the reaction $K^-p \\rightarrow \\pi^-\\Sigma^{*+}$, the initial strangeness comes from the $K^-$ ($S = -1$) and the proton ($S = 0$), totaling $S = -1$. Strangeness is conserved in strong interactions, so the final state must also have $S = -1$. The $\\pi^-$ has $S = 0$, leaving $\\Sigma^{*+}$ with $S = -1$. The absence of the reaction $K^+p \\rightarrow \\pi^+\\Sigma^{*+}$ further confirms this: the initial $S = +1$ (from $K^+$) cannot match the final $S = -1$ (from $\\Sigma^{*+}$), making the reaction forbidden.\n\n(b) The decay $\\Sigma^* \\rightarrow \\pi^+\\Lambda$ is a **strong interaction**.  \n**Explanation:** The decay width $\\Gamma = 35 \\text{ MeV}$ indicates a short lifetime, characteristic of strong decays. Additionally, strangeness is conserved in the decay ($S_{\\Sigma^*} = -1$, $S_{\\Lambda} = -1$, $S_{\\pi} = 0$), which aligns with strong interaction conservation rules. Weak decays typically involve strangeness changes and much smaller decay widths.\n\n(c) The isospin of the $\\Sigma^*$ is **$I = 1$**.  \n**Explanation:** The production reaction $K^-p \\rightarrow \\pi^-\\Sigma^{*+}$ involves combining $K^-$ ($I = 1/2, I_3 = -1/2$) and proton ($I = 1/2, I_3 = +1/2$), yielding total $I = 1$ (antisymmetric combination). The final state $\\pi^-$ ($I = 1, I_3 = -1$) and $\\Sigma^{*+}$ must also form $I = 1$. If $\\Sigma^*$ had $I = 0$, the final state could not match the initial $I = 1$. The forbidden reaction $K^+p \\rightarrow \\pi^+\\Sigma^{*+}$ further supports $I = 1$: the initial $I_3 = +1$ cannot produce the final $I_3 = +2$ (from $\\pi^+$ and $\\Sigma^{*+}$ with $I = 1$).\n\nFinal answers:  \n(a) \\(\\boxed{-1}\\)  \n(b) \\(\\boxed{\\text{Strong}}\\)  \n(c) \\(\\boxed{1}\\)", "final_answers": ["-1", "\\text{Strong}", "1"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "-1", "expr2": "-1"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "-1", "expr2": "-1"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Strong}", "expr2": "-1"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Strong}", "expr2": "\\text{strong decay}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Strong}", "expr2": "1"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "1", "expr2": "-1"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "1", "expr2": "-1"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "1", "expr2": "\\text{strong decay}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "1", "expr2": "1"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "1", "expr2": "1"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.6666666666666666}
{"id": "atomic/3-43", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these physics questions step by step. Starting with part (a). \n\nFor part (a1), the question is about experiments proving there are two kinds of neutrinos. I remember that neutrinos come in different flavors: electron, muon, tau. But the initial discovery was about electron and muon neutrinos. The experiment that comes to mind is the one by Lederman, Schwartz, and Steinberger, where they used a particle accelerator to produce neutrinos and observed interactions. They found that muon neutrinos produced muons, not electrons, indicating a different type. So that showed there are at least two kinds.\n\nThen (a2) asks about experiments showing the interaction cross-section is very small. Neutrinos interact weakly, so detecting them is hard. The classic experiment would be the Cowan-Reines neutrino experiment. They used a nuclear reactor as a neutrino source and a large detector with a target that could capture neutrinos. The low interaction rate proved the cross-section is tiny.\n\nMoving to part (b), reactions where a neutrino produces a single pion with a proton or neutron. Let's think. For a proton target, maybe the neutrino interacts with a proton, producing a charged pion and a lepton. For example, ν + p → n + μ⁺ + π⁺? Wait, but the pion production. Alternatively, maybe ν + p → μ⁻ + π⁺ + p? Wait, charge conservation. Let me check. The neutrino is neutral. If the reaction produces a pion, say a positive pion, then the outgoing particles should balance charge. For example, if a neutrino hits a proton (charge +1), the products could be a muon (charge -1), a positive pion (charge +1), and a neutron (charge 0). Wait, total charge would be -1 +1 +0 = 0. But the initial charge is +1 (proton). That doesn't balance. Hmm. Maybe another approach. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁺ + p? Wait, but the question says the neutrino interacts with a proton or neutron to produce a single pion. So for a proton target, maybe ν_μ + p → μ⁻ + π⁺ + p? But that leaves the proton as a spectator? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe ν + p → μ⁻ + π⁺ + other particles? Wait, but the question specifies a single pion. Let me think of the possible channels. For charged current interactions, neutrinos can produce a charged lepton and a pion. For example, a neutrino interacting with a neutron (which is part of a nucleus maybe) could produce a charged pion. Wait, perhaps for a proton target: ν_μ + p → μ⁻ + π⁺ + p? But that seems like two protons. Alternatively, maybe the proton is converted into a neutron. Wait, let's consider the quark content. A proton is uud. If a neutrino (muon neutrino) interacts with a down quark in the proton, turning it into a muon and a u quark. But maybe producing a pion. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is ν_μ + p → μ⁻ + π⁺ + n? Let's check charges. Initial charge: proton is +1. Products: muon (-1), pion (+1), neutron (0). Total charge: -1 +1 +0 = 0. But initial charge is +1. That's a problem. So maybe that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is ν_μ + p → μ⁻ + π⁺ + p? But then charge would be -1 +1 +1 = +1, matching the initial charge. But then the pion is produced along with the muon. Wait, but the pion is a meson, so maybe the interaction creates a W boson which then decays into a pion and a muon? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct reaction is ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁺ + n? Wait, but the neutron is neutral. Let me think again. Maybe the correct reactions are:\n\nFor proton target: ν_μ + p → μ⁻ + π⁺ + p? But charge conservation: initial +1, final -1 +1 +1 = +1. That works. But is that possible? Alternatively, maybe the proton turns into a delta resonance, which decays into a pion and a nucleon. Alternatively, perhaps the correct reaction is ν_μ + p → μ⁻ + π⁺ + p. But I'm not entirely confident. Maybe another approach: when a neutrino interacts with a nucleon (proton or neutron), it can produce a charged lepton and a pion. For example, with a neutron: ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁺ + n? Wait, but the neutron is neutral. The products would be μ⁻ (-1), π⁺ (+1), and neutron (0). Total charge: 0. Initial charge: 0 (neutron). So that works. But the neutron on both sides? Maybe the neutron is converted into a proton. Wait, perhaps ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁺ + p. Let's check charges: initial 0. Final: -1 (muon) +1 (pion) +1 (proton) = +1. That's a problem. So that can't be. Hmm. Maybe the correct reaction is ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁰ + p. But the question specifies a single pion. Alternatively, maybe the pion is neutral. Wait, but the question says \"single pion\", so maybe either charged or neutral. Let me check standard reactions. For example, in neutrino interactions, a charged current interaction could produce a charged lepton and a pion. For example, ν_μ + p → μ⁻ + π⁺ + p? But that seems redundant. Alternatively, maybe the proton is converted into a neutron and a pion. Wait, perhaps ν_μ + p → μ⁻ + π⁺ + n. Let's check charges: initial +1. Final: -1 (muon) +1 (pion) +0 (neutron) = 0. That's a problem. So charge isn't conserved. Therefore, that can't be right. Maybe the reaction is ν_μ + p → μ⁺ + π⁰ + p? But then the muon charge is positive. Wait, but neutrinos are neutral. Let me think again. The neutrino is a ν_μ, which in charged current interactions would produce a μ⁻. So the reaction must produce a μ⁻. So, for example, ν_μ + p → μ⁻ + π⁺ + p. Charge: +1 initial. Final: -1 +1 +1 = +1. That works. But is that a valid reaction? Alternatively, maybe the proton emits a pion. Alternatively, perhaps the correct reaction is ν_μ + p → μ⁻ + π⁺ + Δ⁺ (which then decays), but the question wants the pion production directly. Maybe the answer is:\n\nFor (b1): ν_μ + p → μ⁻ + π⁺ + p\n\nFor (b2): ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁰ + n? But charge conservation. Wait, ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁺ + n? Charge: initial 0. Final: -1 +1 +0 = 0. That works. But does that happen? Alternatively, maybe ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁺ + p. Then charge: -1 +1 +1 = +1. Initial charge 0. Not matching. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the quark content. A proton is uud. A neutron is udd. A pion+ is u anti-d. So, if a neutrino interacts with a neutron (udd), maybe it converts a d quark to a u quark via W+ emission, producing a muon and a pion. For example, ν_μ + d → μ⁻ + u. But in the context of a neutron (udd), if a d quark is hit, the neutron becomes uud (proton), and the pion is created. So maybe ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁺ + p. But charge: initial 0. Final: -1 (muon) +1 (pion) +1 (proton) = +1. Not conserved. So that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the pion is neutral. For example, ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁰ + p. Charge: -1 +0 +1 = 0. Initial charge 0. That works. But the question says \"single pion\". So maybe that's the case. But the pion here is neutral. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁻ + p + p? No, that's two protons. Not sure. Maybe I need to look up standard neutrino pion production reactions. From what I recall, neutrino interactions can produce single pion via resonance production. For example, ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁺ + (something else?), but I'm getting stuck. Maybe the correct reactions are:\n\nFor proton target: ν_μ + p → μ⁻ + π⁺ + p\n\nFor neutron target: ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁰ + p\n\nBut in the second case, the neutron becomes a proton, and a neutral pion is emitted. But the question says \"single pion\", so that's okay. Alternatively, maybe the neutron reaction produces a negative pion. Wait, ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁻ + p. Charge: initial 0. Final: -1 (muon) -1 (pion) +1 (proton) = -1. Doesn't balance. So that's no good. Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is:\n\n(1) ν_μ + p → μ⁻ + π⁺ + p\n\n(2) ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁰ + n\n\nBut in the second case, the neutron remains a neutron? How? Maybe the neutrino interacts with a neutron, producing a muon, a pion, and the neutron stays. But how? Maybe via a neutral current interaction? But the question specifies \"energetic neutrino may produce a single pion\", which is likely charged current. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's move on and come back.\n\nPart (c): Define helicity and values for neutrino and antineutrino. Helicity is the projection of spin onto the direction of momentum. For neutrinos, they are left-handed (helicity -1), and antineutrinos are right-handed (helicity +1). This is from the Standard Model, where weak interactions are chiral.\n\nPart (d): Decay modes of μ⁺. \n\n(1) μ⁺ → e⁺ + γ. Is this allowed? In the Standard Model, muon decay is μ⁺ → e⁺ + ν_e + anti ν_μ. But decays into e⁺ and gamma would violate conservation laws. Lepton flavor violation? But also, the photon is a vector boson, and the decay would require a spin-1 particle. However, the muon is spin-1/2, and e⁺ is spin-1/2. So total spin would be 1 (if spins opposite) or 0. Photon has spin 1. So maybe possible. But in the Standard Model, such a decay is forbidden because the charged current interactions don't allow it. Also, lepton flavor is conserved in the SM, but here it's same flavor? Wait, μ⁺ decaying to e⁺ and gamma would change lepton flavor (muon to electron), which is not allowed in the SM. So this decay is not possible naturally; it's forbidden by lepton flavor conservation. But wait, the decay μ⁺ → e⁺ + γ would involve a muon turning into an electron, which violates lepton flavor. Hence, it's not allowed in the Standard Model. So the answer is no, because it violates lepton flavor conservation.\n\n(2) μ⁺ → e⁺ + e⁻ + e⁺. This is three electrons. Let's check conservation laws. Charge: μ⁺ has +1. On the right, e⁺ + e⁻ + e⁺ gives +1 -1 +1 = +1. Charge is conserved. Lepton numbers: muon number for μ⁺ is +1. On the right, e⁺ and e⁻ and e⁺: total electron lepton number is +1 (from first e⁺) -1 (from e⁻) +1 (from second e⁺) = +1. So total electron lepton number is +1, and muon number is 0. So muon number is not conserved (original is +1, final is 0). Hence, this decay is forbidden in the Standard Model due to muon number non-conservation. Therefore, it cannot proceed naturally.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\n(a1) The experiment showing two neutrinos was the detection that muon neutrinos produce muons, not electrons (1962 experiment).\n\n(a2) The Cowan-Reines experiment showed the small cross-section by detecting neutrinos from a reactor.\n\n(b1) ν_μ + p → μ⁻ + π⁺ + p\n\n(b2) ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁰ + p (but charge check: initial 0, final -1 +0 +1 = 0. So that works. So maybe ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁰ + p. Alternatively, maybe ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁺ + n? Wait, charge would be -1 +1 +0 = 0. Initial 0. That works. But does that reaction exist? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct reactions are:\n\nFor proton: ν + p → μ⁻ + π⁺ + p\n\nFor neutron: ν + n → μ⁻ + π⁰ + n\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that with a neutron, the reaction produces a charged pion and a proton. For example, ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁺ + p. Charge: 0 initial. Final: -1 +1 +1 = +1. Not conserved. So that's invalid. Therefore, the correct reaction must be ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁰ + p. Charge: -1 +0 +1 = 0. That works. So maybe that's the answer. But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pion is created from the hadronic system. For example, in a charged current interaction, the neutrino interacts with a neutron (udd), converting a d quark to a u quark via W+ emission, producing a muon. The neutron becomes a proton (uud), and a pion (u anti d) is emitted. Wait, but that would require the reaction ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁺ + p. But charge here is 0 → -1 +1 +1 = +1. Not conserved. So that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the pion is neutral. So ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁰ + p. Charge conserved. That seems plausible. So for (b2), that's the reaction.\n\nSo final answers:\n\n(a1) The 1962 experiment by Lederman, Schwartz, and Steinberger showed that muon neutrinos produce muons, not electrons, proving two distinct neutrino types.\n\n(a2) The Cowan-Reines experiment detected reactor neutrinos with a low interaction rate, confirming the small cross-section.\n\n(b1) ν_μ + p → μ⁻ + π⁺ + p\n\n(b2) ν_μ + n → μ⁻ + π⁰ + p\n\n(c) Helicity is the projection of spin onto momentum direction.

{"id": "atomic/3-44", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which method is a sensitive way to measure the mass of the electron neutrino. The options are a, b, or c. Let me start by recalling what each of these options involves.\n\nFirst, option (a) is the angular distribution in electron-neutrino scattering. I remember that in particle physics experiments, angular distributions can give information about the interactions and maybe the properties of particles involved. But how does that relate to mass? Scattering experiments might be more about cross-sections and interaction strengths rather than directly measuring mass. Neutrinos are tricky because they interact weakly, so maybe angular distributions aren't the most direct way to get mass info.\n\nOption (b) is the electron energy spectrum in beta-decay. Beta decay involves the emission of electrons and neutrinos. If the neutrino has mass, that should affect the maximum energy of the emitted electron. In beta decay, the total energy available is shared between the electron and the neutrino. If the neutrino were massless, the electron's energy spectrum would have a sharp cutoff at the maximum energy. But if the neutrino has mass, that maximum energy would be slightly reduced, and the shape of the spectrum near the endpoint would change. This is the basis of the Kurie plot, right? The Kurie plot (or Fermi plot) is used to analyze the beta spectrum. If the neutrino has mass, the plot near the endpoint would curve differently. So measuring the very end of the electron energy spectrum could give information about the neutrino mass. That sounds plausible. Experiments like KATRIN are designed to do this, I think. They look for the tiny deviation at the high-energy end of the spectrum caused by a non-zero neutrino mass.\n\nOption (c) is the neutrino flux from the sun. Solar neutrino experiments measure the number of neutrinos coming from the sun. However, the issue there is more about neutrino oscillations, where neutrinos change flavors as they travel. The observed deficit in electron neutrinos from the sun led to the discovery of oscillations, which imply that neutrinos have mass. But does measuring the flux directly give the mass? I think oscillations depend on the mass squared differences between different neutrino masses, not the absolute mass. So while solar neutrino experiments tell us about mass differences and that neutrinos have mass, they might not directly measure the absolute mass of the electron neutrino. The flux itself might be affected by oscillations, but that's more about the mixing angles and mass differences rather than the absolute mass value.\n\nPutting this together: The most direct method to measure the electron neutrino mass is looking at the beta decay spectrum. The endpoint of the electron energy spectrum is sensitive to the neutrino mass because if the neutrino has mass, the maximum energy the electron can have is reduced. So even a tiny mass would cause a noticeable effect at the very high end of the electron energy distribution. That's why experiments like KATRIN use tritium beta decay to try to measure the neutrino mass by precisely measuring the electron energies near the endpoint. Angular distributions in scattering (a) might not be as sensitive, and solar neutrino flux (c) gives info about mass differences but not the absolute mass. So the answer should be (b).\n</think>\n\nThe most sensitive method to measure the electron neutrino mass involves analyzing the electron energy spectrum in beta-decay. In beta decay, the total energy is shared between the electron and neutrino. If the neutrino is massless, the electron's energy spectrum has a sharp cutoff at the maximum energy. However, a non-zero neutrino mass reduces this maximum energy and alters the spectrum's shape near the endpoint. Experiments like KATRIN use tritium beta decay to detect this subtle deviation, providing a direct probe of the neutrino mass. While solar neutrino flux (c) reveals mass differences via oscillations, and angular distributions (a) relate to interactions, the beta-decay spectrum (b) uniquely targets the absolute neutrino mass.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(b)}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["(b)"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "(b)", "expr2": "(b)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "b", "expr2": "b"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/3-16", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is about identifying which of the given reactions violate a conservation law in particle physics. For each reaction, I need to check the conservation of various quantities like charge, baryon number, lepton numbers (electron, muon, tau), and possibly other laws like energy conservation if applicable. Let's go through each reaction one by one.\n\nStarting with the first reaction: μ⁺ → e⁺ + γ. Let's check the conservation laws here. \n\nFirst, charge conservation. The muon μ⁺ has a charge of +1. On the right side, e⁺ is +1 and the photon γ is neutral. So total charge on the right is +1, which matches the left. Charge is conserved.\n\nNext, baryon number. Muons and electrons are leptons, so their baryon numbers are 0. Photons also have 0. So baryon number is conserved here.\n\nNow lepton numbers. The muon has a muon lepton number of +1 (since it's a μ⁺), and electron lepton number 0. On the right, the positron e⁺ has an electron lepton number of -1 (since antiparticles have negative lepton numbers), and the photon has 0. So total electron lepton number on the right is -1, which doesn't match the left (0). But wait, the original particle is a muon, so the muon lepton number on the left is +1. On the right, the e⁺ has electron lepton number -1, and the photon has 0. So the muon lepton number on the right is 0. So here, the muon lepton number isn't conserved (left is +1, right is 0), and the electron lepton number is -1 on the right vs. 0 on the left. Therefore, this reaction violates both muon and electron lepton number conservation. But wait, in the Standard Model, leptons are conserved per family. So a muon can decay into an electron, but only with the appropriate neutrinos. However, here it's emitting a photon, which doesn't carry lepton number. So this decay would violate conservation of lepton numbers. Therefore, this reaction is not allowed. The law violated is the conservation of lepton numbers (muon and electron).\n\nMoving to the second reaction: e⁻ → ν_e + γ. Let's check charge first. The left side has charge -1. On the right, the neutrino ν_e is neutral, and the photon is neutral. So total charge is 0. That's a problem. Charge isn't conserved here. So this reaction violates charge conservation. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. The electron is e⁻, charge -1. The products are ν_e (0) and γ (0). So total charge is 0. So charge isn't conserved. Therefore, this reaction violates charge conservation. So that's a clear violation. So this reaction is not allowed.\n\nThird reaction: p + p → p + Σ⁺ + K⁻. Let's check the conservation laws here. Let's start with charge. Left side: each proton is +1, so total +2. Right side: proton is +1, Σ⁺ is +1, K⁻ is -1. Total charge is +1 +1 -1 = +1. So charge isn't conserved. Wait, left is +2, right is +1. So charge isn't conserved. Therefore, this reaction violates charge conservation. But wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again. Σ⁺ has charge +1, K⁻ is -1. So p (1) + Σ⁺ (1) + K⁻ (-1) = 1 +1 -1 =1. So total charge on right is 1. Left is 2. So charge isn't conserved. Therefore, this reaction violates charge conservation. So that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the particles' charges. Let me confirm. The Σ⁺ is a baryon with charge +1. K⁻ is a meson with charge -1. So yes, the sum is +1. So charge isn't conserved. Therefore, this reaction is invalid due to charge conservation.\n\nFourth reaction: p → e⁺ + ν_e. Let's check. Charge: proton is +1. On the right, e⁺ is +1, neutrino ν_e is 0. Total charge +1. So charge is conserved. Baryon number: proton has +1. On the right, e⁺ and ν_e are leptons, so baryon number 0. So total baryon number on right is 0. Left is +1. So baryon number isn't conserved. Therefore, this reaction violates baryon number conservation. Also, lepton numbers: the proton has 0 for all lepton numbers. On the right, e⁺ has electron lepton number -1 (since it's a positron), and ν_e has electron lepton number +1. So total electron lepton number is -1 +1 = 0. So that's okay. But baryon number is not conserved. So this reaction violates baryon number conservation. Therefore, it's not allowed.\n\nFifth reaction: p → e⁺ + n + ν_e. Let's check. Charge: proton is +1. On the right, e⁺ is +1, neutron is 0, ν_e is 0. Total charge +1. So charge is conserved. Baryon number: proton has +1. On the right, neutron has +1, others are 0. So total baryon number +1. So that's conserved. Lepton numbers: proton has 0. On the right, e⁺ has electron lepton number -1, ν_e has +1. So total electron lepton number is 0. So that's okay. Wait, but the proton is decaying into a neutron, which is allowed? Wait, but protons are supposed to be stable, but in terms of conservation laws, let's check. Let's see: Baryon number: left is 1, right is 1 (neutron). So okay. Charge: +1 on left, +1 (e⁺) +0 +0 = +1. Okay. Lepton numbers: e⁺ has electron lepton number -1, ν_e has +1. So total 0. So that's okay. But wait, the proton is a baryon, and the neutron is also a baryon. So baryon number is conserved. However, in reality, protons are stable (as per the Standard Model), but this decay would require some process. However, in terms of conservation laws, is there any violation? Let me check again. Charge is conserved. Baryon number: proton (1) → neutron (1) + e⁺ (0) + ν_e (0). Wait, no: the neutron's baryon number is 1. So total baryon number on the right is 1. So that's okay. Lepton numbers: e⁺ has electron lepton number -1, ν_e has +1. So total 0. So that's okay. So all conservation laws are satisfied. But wait, in reality, protons don't decay, but according to conservation laws, this reaction doesn't violate any. However, maybe there's another issue. Let me think. The proton is made of quarks (uud). The neutron is udd. So to go from proton to neutron, you need to change a u quark to a d quark. That would require emitting a positron and a neutrino? Wait, beta plus decay is when a proton is converted to a neutron, emitting a positron and a neutrino. But wait, beta plus decay occurs in a nucleus where a proton converts to a neutron, emitting a positron and a neutrino. But for a free proton, that's not possible because the mass of the proton is less than the neutron. Wait, the neutron is heavier than the proton. So a free proton can't decay into a neutron plus positron and neutrino because that would require energy. But in terms of conservation laws, if the masses allowed, would it be allowed? Let's see. The rest mass of the proton is about 938 MeV/c². The neutron is about 939.5 MeV/c², which is slightly heavier. The positron has mass ~0.511 MeV/c², and the neutrino is negligible. So the total mass on the right would be 939.5 + 0.511 ≈ 940 MeV, which is more than the proton's 938 MeV. So energy conservation would require that the proton can't decay into heavier particles. Therefore, this reaction violates energy conservation. But the question is about conservation laws, not energy. So if we ignore energy considerations (since the problem doesn't mention it), then according to charge, baryon, and lepton numbers, it's allowed. But in reality, energy conservation would prevent it. However, the problem asks which reactions violate a conservation law. So if the reaction is possible in terms of charge, baryon, lepton numbers, then it's allowed. But here, the problem might not consider energy, only the other conservation laws. So according to the standard conservation laws (charge, baryon, lepton), this reaction is allowed. But wait, the original reaction is p → e⁺ + n + ν_e. Let me check again. Baryon number: left is 1 (proton), right is 1 (neutron) + 0 + 0 =1. So okay. Charge: +1 = +1 (e⁺) +0 (n) +0 (ν_e). So okay. Lepton numbers: electron lepton number. On the left, 0. On the right, e⁺ has -1, ν_e has +1. So total 0. So okay. So all conservation laws are satisfied. Therefore, this reaction does not violate any conservation laws. But wait, in reality, this decay is not observed because the proton is stable, but according to the conservation laws, it's allowed. So the answer here is that this reaction does not violate any conservation laws. But wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The proton is a baryon, and the neutron is a baryon. So baryon number is conserved. The positron and neutrino are leptons. So their lepton numbers cancel out. So yes, all conservation laws are satisfied. Therefore, this reaction is allowed. But in reality, the mass issue makes it impossible, but the question is about conservation laws, not kinematics. So this reaction is allowed. So no violation here.\n\nSixth reaction: n → p + e⁻ + ν_e_bar. Let's check. This is the standard beta decay of a neutron. Charge: neutron is 0. On the right, proton is +1, e⁻ is -1, ν_e_bar is 0. Total charge +1 -1 = 0. So charge conserved. Baryon number: left is 1 (neutron), right is 1 (proton) +0 +0 =1. Conserved. Lepton numbers: neutron has 0. On the right, e⁻ has electron lepton number +1, and ν_e_bar (which is the antineutrino) has electron lepton number -1. So total 0. So all conservation laws are satisfied. Therefore, this reaction is allowed and does not violate any laws.\n\nSeventh reaction: π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ. Let's check. Charge: π⁺ is +1. On the right, μ⁺ is +1, ν_μ is 0. Total charge +1. So charge conserved. Baryon number: π⁺ is a meson, baryon number 0. Right side: μ⁺ and ν_μ are leptons, so baryon number 0. Conserved. Lepton numbers: π⁺ has 0. On the right, μ⁺ has muon lepton number +1, and ν_μ has muon lepton number +1. So total muon lepton number +2. Wait, that's a problem. The left side has 0, right has +2. So muon lepton number isn't conserved. Wait, but this is the decay of a pion. Wait, the standard decay of π⁺ is to μ⁺ + ν_μ. Wait, but let me check. The pion decay is π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ. So the muon lepton number on the right is +1 (mu⁺) and +1 (ν_μ), totaling +2. But the left side is 0. That would imply a violation. But that's not possible because the pion decay is a known process. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The pion is a meson, composed of a quark and antiquark. When it decays, it's via the weak interaction. The decay π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ is allowed. But according to lepton numbers, the muon lepton number on the right is +1 (mu⁺) and the neutrino is ν_μ, which is a muon neutrino, so also +1. So total +2. But the pion has 0. So that's a problem. Wait, but in reality, this decay is allowed. So maybe there's a mistake in my analysis. Wait, perhaps the neutrino emitted is actually an antineutrino? Let me check. The standard decay of π⁺ is to μ⁺ plus a muon antineutrino. Wait, no. Let me recall: the decay π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ. The ν_μ is the muon neutrino. But in terms of lepton number, the muon has +1, and the neutrino has +1. So total +2. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps the neutrino is actually an antineutrino. Let me check the actual decay products. The correct decay is π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ. Wait, but the ν_μ here is a muon antineutrino? Or a neutrino? Let me think. The pion is composed of u and anti-d quarks. When it decays, the u and anti-d annihilate via the weak interaction, producing a W⁺ boson, which then decays into a mu⁺ and a muon neutrino. Wait, the W⁺ decays into μ⁺ and ν_μ (muon neutrino). So the ν_μ is a neutrino, not an antineutrino. Therefore, the lepton numbers would be: μ⁺ has muon lepton number -1 (since it's the antiparticle), and ν_μ has muon lepton number +1. Wait, no. Wait, particles and antiparticles: for leptons, the particle has lepton number +1, antiparticle -1. So μ⁺ is the antiparticle of μ⁻, so it has muon lepton number -1. The ν_μ is the neutrino associated with muon, so when a mu⁻ decays, it emits a ν_μ (particle), but in this case, the W⁺ decay would produce a μ⁺ and a ν_μ. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify. The W⁺ boson has charge +1. To decay into a μ⁺ (charge +1) and a neutrino (charge 0), the neutrino must be a muon antineutrino. Because the W⁺ decay would produce a μ⁺ and a ν̄_μ. Because the decay products must have a total charge of +1. The μ⁺ is +1, and the antineutrino is neutral. So the decay is π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν̄_μ. Ah, that's the correct decay. So the neutrino emitted is actually an antineutrino. Therefore, the muon lepton number on the right is μ⁺ (which is a lepton antiparticle, so muon lepton number -1) and ν̄_μ (which is antineutrino, so muon lepton number -1). So total muon lepton number on the right is -2. But the left side is 0. That's a problem. Wait, this can't be right. Let me check a reference. The pion decay π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ. Wait, but according to conservation laws, the lepton numbers must be conserved. The pion has 0. The μ⁺ is a muon antilepton (lepton number -1 for muon), and the ν_μ is a muon neutrino (lepton number +1). So total muon lepton number is -1 +1 = 0. Therefore, it's conserved. Wait, that makes sense. So the confusion was whether the neutrino is a particle or antiparticle. Let me clarify. The decay process must conserve lepton number. The pion has 0. So the decay products must have total lepton number 0. The μ⁺ is a muon antilepton, so muon lepton number -1. The ν_μ is a muon neutrino, which has muon lepton number +1. So total muon lepton number is 0. Therefore, it's conserved. So the correct decay is π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ. Therefore, the muon lepton number is conserved. So in this reaction, the muon lepton number is conserved. Therefore, this reaction is allowed and does not violate any conservation laws. So the initial analysis was incorrect because I misassigned the neutrino type. Therefore, the correct analysis shows that lepton numbers are conserved. Therefore, this reaction is allowed.\n\nNow, summarizing each reaction:\n\n1. μ⁺ → e⁺ + γ: Violates muon and electron lepton number conservation.\n2. e⁻ → ν_e + γ: Violates charge conservation.\n3. p + p → p + Σ⁺ + K⁻: Violates charge conservation.\n4. p → e⁺ + ν_e: Violates baryon number conservation.\n5. p → e⁺ + n + ν_e: All conservation laws are satisfied.\n6. n → p + e⁻ + ν_e_bar: All conservation laws are satisfied (standard beta decay).\n7. π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ: All conservation laws are satisfied (correct decay).\n\nSo the reactions that violate conservation laws are 1, 2, 3, 4. The others are allowed.\n</think>\n\n- **$\\mu^+ \\rightarrow e^+ + \\gamma$**: Violates **muon and electron lepton number conservation**.

{"id": "atomic/3-29", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these two physics problems. Starting with part (a). The question is about the inherent uncertainty in the mass of particle X, which has two decay modes with partial decay rates γ₁ and γ₂. Hmm, inherent uncertainty in mass... I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the uncertainty in energy and time. The energy-time uncertainty principle states that ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. Since mass and energy are related by E = mc², the uncertainty in mass would be related to the uncertainty in energy. \n\nBut wait, the particle's lifetime is connected to the decay rate. The total decay rate Γ is the sum of the partial decay rates, so Γ = γ₁ + γ₂. The mean lifetime τ of the particle is the inverse of the total decay rate, τ = 1/Γ. The uncertainty in energy ΔE is approximately Γ multiplied by ħ, right? Because Γ has units of inverse seconds, so Γħ would give units of energy. So ΔE ≈ ħΓ. Then, since ΔE = Δm c², solving for Δm gives Δm ≈ ħΓ / c². \n\nSo putting it all together, the inherent uncertainty in mass should be ħ times the total decay rate divided by c squared. Therefore, the answer for part (a) is Δm = ħ(γ₁ + γ₂)/c². Let me check the units. Γ is in sec⁻¹, so ħΓ has units of J·s·s⁻¹ = J. Then dividing by c² (m²/s²) gives J·s²/m². Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so J·s²/m² is kg. Yep, units check out for mass. So that seems right.\n\nMoving on to part (b). The decay mode given is X → π⁺ + π⁺. We need to determine something about the isotopic spin (isospin) of X. Isospin is a symmetry in particle physics, particularly for strong interactions. The pions form an isospin triplet: π⁺, π⁰, π⁻ with I = 1 and I₃ = +1, 0, -1 respectively. \n\nThe decay X → π⁺ + π⁺ is a strong interaction decay, so isospin must be conserved. Let's consider the isospin of the products. Each π⁺ has I = 1 and I₃ = +1. So combining two π⁺ particles. The total I₃ would be 1 + 1 = 2. Since isospin is conserved, the initial particle X must have I₃ = 2. But the total isospin I of the two pions can be found by combining two I=1 states. The possible total I values are 2, 1, 0. However, the combination of two identical bosons (since both are π⁺) must be symmetric under exchange. The isospin part of the wavefunction must be symmetric. The spin (here pions are spin 0) spatial part is symmetric because their orbital angular momentum L must be even (since for identical bosons, the total wavefunction is symmetric; spin 0 implies symmetric spin part, so spatial part must be symmetric, hence even L). But the isospin part: combining two I=1 states. Let's see, the symmetric combinations would be I=2 and I=0. Because when you combine two identical particles with integer spin, the symmetric states are the even I values. Wait, combining two I=1 states: the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition is 1 ⊗ 1 = 2 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 0. The symmetric ones are I=2 and I=0, and the antisymmetric is I=1. Since the pions are identical bosons, their total wavefunction must be symmetric. The spatial part (angular momentum) is symmetric if L is even. Assuming the decay is in the lowest angular momentum state (L=0, which is even), then the isospin wavefunction must also be symmetric. Therefore, the isospin combination must be symmetric, which corresponds to I=2 or I=0. However, the total I₃ is 2, so the only possible I that can have I₃=2 is I=2 (since I₃ can't exceed I). Therefore, the total isospin of the two pions must be I=2. Since the decay is strong, the isospin of X must match. Therefore, the isotopic spin of X must be I=2. \n\nWait, but could X have higher isospin? No, because the decay products have total I=2, so X must have at least I=2. But if X had higher I, say I=3, then there could be a component with I₃=2, but the decay would have to conserve I as well as I₃. However, in strong interactions, the interaction conserves the total isospin, so the initial state (X) must have the same I and I₃ as the final state. Since the final state has I=2 and I₃=2, X must have I ≥ 2, but the minimal possibility is I=2. However, in reality, particles usually have the minimal possible isospin. But the question is asking what can we conclude. Since the decay is possible, X must have an isospin that includes the I=2 state. Therefore, the isotopic spin of X must be I=2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the conclusion is that the isospin of X must be even? Wait, no. Because the combination of two pions in I=2 would require X to have I=2. So the answer is that the isotopic spin of X is 2. But let me check. For example, the rho meson has isospin 1, and decays into two pions. But wait, rho decays into two pions, but rho has I=1. However, the two pion system in that case would have I=1. But wait, the rho decay is a strong decay? Wait, actually, rho meson decays via the strong interaction, but its lifetime is much shorter, but maybe that's a different story. Wait, but if X decays into two π⁺, which requires the two pions to have I=2, then X must have I=2. Because in the decay process, the isospin is conserved. So the initial isospin of X must equal the total isospin of the decay products. Therefore, X must have I=2. \n\nSo part (b) conclusion: the isotopic spin of X is 2.\n</think>\n\n(a) The inherent uncertainty in the mass of particle \\( X \\) arises from the energy-time uncertainty principle \\( \\Delta E \\Delta t \\gtrsim \\hbar \\).

{"id": "atomic/3-11", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. First, I need to list all the known leptons. From what I remember, leptons are elementary particles that don't participate in strong interactions. They include electrons, muons, taus, and their associated neutrinos, along with their antiparticles. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Electron (e⁻) and its neutrino (νₑ)\n2. Muon (μ⁻) and its neutrino (ν_μ)\n3. Tau (τ⁻) and its neutrino (ν_τ)\nAnd their antiparticles: e⁺, νₑ̄, μ⁺, ν_μ̄, τ⁺, ν_τ̄. So that's six leptons and six antileptons, making 12 in total. But the question says \"known leptons,\" so I think that's correct.\n\nNext part: How does μ⁺ decay? I recall that muons are unstable. The decay process for a muon minus (μ⁻) is usually into an electron, electron antineutrino, and muon neutrino: μ⁻ → e⁻ + ν̄_e + ν_μ. But since the question is about μ⁺, the decay should involve the corresponding antiparticles. So μ⁺ → e⁺ + ν_e + ν̄_μ. Wait, but I should check the exact decay products. Let me confirm. The positive muon decays into a positron, electron neutrino, and muon antineutrino. Yes, that's right: μ⁺ → e⁺ + ν_e + ν̄_μ. Because in beta decay, the charges have to balance. The muon is positive, so the positron is positive, and the neutrinos are neutral. The conservation of lepton numbers might play a role here.\n\nNow, the next part: considering the decay of μ⁺ and the fact that the reaction ν_μ + n → e⁻ + p is forbidden, we need to discuss possible lepton quantum number assignments that satisfy additive conservation laws. Hmm. Let's think. In the forbidden reaction, a muon neutrino interacts with a neutron to produce an electron and a proton. But this is not allowed. So, maybe there's a conservation law for muon and electron lepton numbers separately. \n\nIn the Standard Model, each lepton flavor (electron, muon, tau) has its own lepton number. So, for example, the electron lepton number L_e is +1 for e⁻ and ν_e, -1 for their antiparticles, and 0 otherwise. Similarly for L_mu and L_tau. If that's the case, then in the reaction ν_μ + n → e⁻ + p, let's check the lepton numbers. The ν_μ has L_mu = +1, L_e = 0. The neutron (n) is made of quarks (udd), so no lepton numbers. On the right side, e⁻ has L_e = +1, and the proton (uud) has no lepton numbers. So the left side has L_mu = +1, L_e = 0. The right side has L_e = +1, L_mu = 0. So total L_mu is not conserved (goes from +1 to 0), and L_e is not conserved (0 to +1). Therefore, if both L_e and L_mu are conserved separately, this reaction is forbidden. That explains why it's forbidden. So the assignment is that each lepton flavor has its own quantum number, conserved additively. So the possible assignments are individual lepton numbers for each generation.\n\nBut the question says \"discuss possible lepton quantum number assignments.\" Maybe there's another way? For example, if there was a universal lepton number, but that wouldn't explain why the reaction is forbidden. Because in that case, the total lepton number would be conserved. Let's see: ν_μ has L=+1, e⁻ has L=+1. So total lepton number is +1 on both sides. But the reaction is forbidden, so that suggests that individual lepton numbers are needed, not just total lepton number. Therefore, the assignments must be separate L_e, L_mu, etc.\n\nNow, the last part: How could ν_μ produce a new charged \"heavy lepton\"? Let's think. If a muon neutrino interacts to produce a heavy charged lepton, maybe in a process like ν_μ + something → L⁺ + other particles. But how? For example, in a collision with a nucleus, maybe via a charged current interaction. Suppose there's a new heavy lepton, say, a tau (but tau is already known), but maybe a hypothetical heavier lepton. Wait, the question says \"new charged heavy lepton,\" so perhaps a fourth generation lepton. But assuming we're within the Standard Model, which has three generations. Alternatively, maybe through a process where the muon neutrino interacts and creates a charged heavy lepton. For example, in a reaction ν_μ + nucleus → L⁻ + hadrons. But how would the quantum numbers work? The muon neutrino has L_mu = +1. The heavy lepton L⁻ would have its own lepton number, say L_L = +1. But then, if we assign separate lepton numbers, the reaction would require that L_mu is converted into L_L, which would violate conservation unless there's a mixing. Alternatively, if the heavy lepton is part of a new family, then perhaps the neutrino could interact via some new force. Alternatively, maybe through a leptoquark or something else. But perhaps the answer is that if the muon neutrino has a lepton number that can be converted into the new lepton's number, then in a process where ν_μ interacts, it could emit a W boson and turn into the heavy lepton. For example, ν_μ → L⁺ + W⁻, but that's a decay, but neutrinos don't decay. Alternatively, in an interaction with a quark, like ν_μ + d → L⁻ + u, mediated by a W boson. For that to happen, the lepton number must be conserved. If L_mu is conserved, then L⁻ would have to carry L_mu = +1, but then when it decays, it would have to produce a muon, but if it's a new lepton, maybe it has its own quantum number. Alternatively, maybe the new heavy lepton has a different lepton number, and the interaction violates individual lepton numbers but conserves total lepton number. But the previous part of the question established that individual lepton numbers are conserved. So perhaps the production would require that the new lepton has a lepton number that's a combination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the heavy lepton is part of a doublet with a neutrino, similar to how the muon is part of a doublet with its neutrino. So if there's a new heavy lepton L⁻ and its neutrino ν_L, then a charged current interaction could produce L⁻ if there's mixing between ν_μ and ν_L. But that's getting into beyond the Standard Model physics. The question is asking how ν_μ could produce a new charged heavy lepton, so perhaps via a charged current interaction where the neutrino turns into the heavy lepton, but that would require a mixing between the muon neutrino and the new heavy lepton's charged current. Alternatively, if there's a new interaction that allows ν_μ to interact and produce the heavy lepton. Maybe through a new gauge boson or something. But I think the key point is that if the muon neutrino has a lepton number that can be transferred to the new lepton, then such a process is possible. For example, if the new heavy lepton has a lepton number L_new, and the interaction allows converting L_mu into L_new, but that would violate conservation unless there's some symmetry. Alternatively, if the new lepton is part of a family where its own lepton number is conserved. Hmm, this part is a bit tricky. Maybe the answer is that if the new heavy lepton is assigned a muon lepton number, then the production via ν_μ (which has L_mu = 1) would require that the heavy lepton also carries L_mu = 1, allowing the reaction to conserve L_mu. For example, ν_μ + quark → L⁺ + quark', where L⁺ has L_mu = +1. Then, when L⁺ decays, it would have to emit a μ⁺ and neutrinos to conserve L_mu. But the problem states that ν_μ + n → e⁻ + p is forbidden, which is because L_e and L_mu are separately conserved. So if the new heavy lepton has its own lepton number, say L_L, then the production would require some violation or mixing. Alternatively, maybe the heavy lepton shares both L_mu and another quantum number. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the answer is that the new charged heavy lepton must carry the same muon lepton number as the muon neutrino, allowing the interaction ν_μ → L⁺ + W⁻ (or similar) where the lepton number is conserved. Therefore, the assignment of L_mu to the new lepton would allow its production by a muon neutrino.\n</think>\n\nThe known leptons are:\n\n- **Electron (e⁻)** and electron neutrino (νₑ)\n- **Muon (μ⁻)** and muon neutrino (ν_μ)\n- **Tau (τ⁻)** and tau neutrino (ν_τ)  \nAlong with their antiparticles: e⁺, μ⁺, τ⁺, ν̄ₑ, ν̄_μ, ν̄_τ.

{"id": "atomic/4-39", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The question is asking what energy of γ-rays would have their lifetimes limited by pair production with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. \n\nSo, pair production is when a high-energy photon (γ-ray) interacts with a lower-energy photon (like the CMB photon) to produce an electron-positron pair. The threshold energy for this process is when the combined energy of the two photons is at least the rest mass energy of the electron and positron, which is 2m_e c². \n\nBut wait, the CMB photon has an energy E ~ 10^-3 eV. Let me recall the formula for the threshold condition. The center-of-momentum (CM) frame energy must be at least 2m_e c². So, if the γ-ray has energy E_γ and the CMB photon has energy ε, then the product of their energies in the lab frame (where the CMB photon is at rest?) or in some frame... Hmm, maybe I should use the invariant quantity s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (p_γ c + p_ε c)^2. But since the CMB photon is low energy, maybe we can approximate it as a head-on collision. \n\nAlternatively, the threshold condition can be approximated by E_γ * ε ≥ (m_e c²)^2. Wait, that might be a simplified version. Let me check. The threshold for pair production (γ + γ → e+ + e-) requires that the sum of the photon energies in the center-of-mass frame is at least 2m_e c². But since one photon is the high-energy γ-ray and the other is the CMB photon, which is much lower energy, maybe we can use the approximation where the product of their energies in the lab frame (assuming they collide head-on) is (E_γ * ε) ≥ (m_e c²)^2. \n\nWait, actually, the correct threshold condition for pair production in a head-on collision is E_γ * ε ≥ (m_e c²)^2. So, solving for E_γ, we get E_γ ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / ε. \n\nGiven that ε is the CMB photon energy, which is 10^-3 eV. Let's compute that. \n\nFirst, m_e c² is the rest mass energy of the electron, which is approximately 0.511 MeV. So, 0.511 MeV = 0.511 × 10^6 eV. \n\nSo, E_γ ≥ (0.511 × 10^6 eV)^2 / (10^-3 eV) \n\nCalculating that: (0.511 × 10^6)^2 = (0.511)^2 × 10^12 ≈ 0.261 × 10^12 (eV)^2 \n\nDivide by 10^-3 eV: 0.261 × 10^12 / 10^-3 = 0.261 × 10^15 eV = 2.61 × 10^14 eV \n\nSo, approximately 10^15 eV? Wait, 0.261 × 10^15 is 2.61 × 10^14 eV. Hmm, but maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me check again. \n\nWait, 0.511 × 10^6 eV is 511,000 eV. Squaring that gives (511,000)^2 = (5.11 × 10^5)^2 = 26.11 × 10^10 = 2.611 × 10^11 (eV)^2. Then divide by ε = 1e-3 eV: 2.611e11 / 1e-3 = 2.611e14 eV. So, approximately 2.6 × 10^14 eV. That's 260 TeV. Wait, but the question is about the energy where the γ-rays' lifetimes are limited by this process. So, maybe this threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the process to occur. But the cross-section is given as σ_T/3. However, the cross-section is only significant when the energy is above the threshold. So, the γ-rays that can actually undergo this process would have energies around or above this threshold. Therefore, the energy we calculated, ~10^14 eV (or 100 TeV), is the threshold. But the question is asking for the energy where their lifetimes are limited by this process, which would be energies where the interaction time is comparable to the age of the universe or something. Wait, maybe we need to compute the mean free path or the interaction time. \n\nWait, part (a) is about the energy where the lifetime is limited by this process. So, perhaps we need to find the energy where the interaction rate is significant enough that the γ-rays don't survive for a long time. The interaction rate Γ is n_photon * σ * c, where n_photon is the number density of the CMB photons, σ is the cross-section, and c is the speed of light. The lifetime τ is 1/Γ. So, if the lifetime τ is comparable to the age of the universe, then those γ-rays would have their lifetimes limited by this process. \n\nBut the problem doesn't give the age of the universe, but part (c) asks to compare with the size of the universe. Maybe we can proceed step by step. \n\nFirst, let's compute the cross-section. The cross-section given is σ_T/3, where σ_T is the Thomson cross-section. σ_T = (8π/3) r_e², and r_e = e²/(m c²). Let's recall the value of σ_T. The Thomson cross-section is approximately 6.65 × 10^-25 cm². So, σ = σ_T /3 ≈ 2.217 × 10^-25 cm². \n\nThe number density of CMB photons is given as ~300 cm^-3. So, n = 300 cm^-3. \n\nThe interaction rate Γ = n * σ * c. Let's compute Γ. \n\nFirst, convert all units to consistent units. Let's use c in cm/s: c ≈ 3 × 10^10 cm/s. \n\nSo, Γ = 300 cm^-3 * 2.217e-25 cm² * 3e10 cm/s \n\nCalculating that: 300 * 2.217e-25 = 6.651e-23 \n\nMultiply by 3e10: 6.651e-23 * 3e10 = 1.9953e-12 s^-1 \n\nSo, Γ ≈ 2e-12 s^-1 \n\nThe lifetime τ = 1/Γ ≈ 5e11 seconds. \n\nNow, converting that to years: 5e11 s / (3.15e7 s/year) ≈ 1.58e4 years. Wait, that's only about 15,800 years. But the age of the universe is ~13.8 billion years. So, this would imply that the interaction time is much shorter than the age of the universe, meaning that high-energy γ-rays would be absorbed quickly. But this seems contradictory. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the cross-section given is σ_T/3. But the cross-section for pair production is not necessarily the same as the Thomson cross-section. However, the problem states that the pair-production cross-section is σ_T/3, so we can take that as given. \n\nBut let's recalculate Γ. \n\nn = 300 cm^-3 \n\nσ = σ_T /3 ≈ (6.65e-25 cm²)/3 ≈ 2.217e-25 cm² \n\nc = 3e10 cm/s \n\nΓ = n * σ * c = 300 * 2.217e-25 * 3e10 \n\nCompute step by step: \n\n300 * 3e10 = 9e13 \n\n9e13 * 2.217e-25 = 9 * 2.217e-12 = 19.953e-12 ≈ 2e-11 s^-1 \n\nWait, 300 * 2.217e-25 = 6.651e-23 \n\n6.651e-23 * 3e10 = 1.9953e-12 s^-1 \n\nYes, that's 2e-12 s^-1. So τ = 1 / 2e-12 s^-1 = 5e11 seconds. \n\nConvert seconds to years: 5e11 s / (3.15e7 s/year) ≈ 5e11 / 3.15e7 ≈ 1.58e4 years ≈ 16,000 years. \n\nBut the age of the universe is ~1.38e10 years. So, if the lifetime is 1.6e4 years, that's way shorter. So, this would mean that γ-rays with energies above the threshold would have their lifetimes limited by this process. But wait, the cross-section is only non-zero when the energy is above the threshold. So, the cross-section is σ_T/3 only when the photon energy is above the threshold. Therefore, the interaction rate is only significant for photons above the threshold energy. \n\nTherefore, the energy at which the lifetime is limited by this process is the threshold energy. But wait, the cross-section might have a different energy dependence. However, the problem states that the cross-section is σ_T/3. So, perhaps they are approximating the cross-section as σ_T/3 for energies above the threshold. \n\nTherefore, the interaction rate is Γ = n σ c. For the lifetime to be limited by this process, the mean free time τ = 1/Γ must be much less than the age of the universe. But in our calculation, τ is 1.6e4 years, which is much less than the age of the universe (1e10 years). Therefore, any γ-rays above the threshold energy would have their lifetimes limited by this process. Therefore, the answer to part (a) is the threshold energy, which we calculated as ~2.6e14 eV, or 260 TeV. \n\nWait, but 2.6e14 eV is 260 TeV. However, the actual threshold might be a bit different. Let me check the exact threshold calculation. \n\nThe threshold condition for pair production is that the sum of the photon energies in the center-of-mass frame must be at least 2m_e c². For a head-on collision, the threshold condition is given by: \n\nE_γ * ε (1 - cosθ) ≥ 2(m_e c²)^2 \n\nBut since the CMB photons are isotropic, the angle θ can vary. The average value of (1 - cosθ) for an isotropic distribution is 2. So, the effective threshold becomes E_γ * ε * 2 ≥ 2(m_e c²)^2, which simplifies to E_γ * ε ≥ (m_e c²)^2. \n\nSo, the threshold energy is indeed E_γ = (m_e c²)^2 / ε. \n\nPlugging in the numbers: \n\nm_e c² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV \n\nε = 1e-3 eV \n\nSo, E_γ = (0.511e6)^2 / 1e-3 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 / 1e-3 = 0.261 * 1e15 = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV. \n\nSo, approximately 3e14 eV or 300 TeV. \n\nTherefore, γ-rays with energies around this value or higher would have their lifetimes limited by pair production with CMB photons. \n\nBut wait, the cross-section is given as σ_T/3. However, the actual cross-section for pair production is energy-dependent and peaks near the threshold. But the problem states to take the cross-section as σ_T/3. Therefore, regardless of energy above threshold, the cross-section is σ_T/3. Therefore, once the photon energy is above the threshold, the interaction rate is Γ = n σ c, leading to a certain lifetime. \n\nBut in our calculation, even at threshold, the interaction time is 1.6e4 years, which is much shorter than the age of the universe. Therefore, any γ-ray above the threshold energy would have a short lifetime compared to the age of the universe, so their lifetimes are indeed limited by this process. Therefore, the answer to part (a) is the threshold energy, which is ~2.6e14 eV or ~260 TeV. \n\nMoving to part (b): What is the average distance they would travel before being converted into e+ e- pairs? \n\nThe average distance is the mean free path, which is c * τ. Since τ = 1/Γ, the mean free path λ = c * τ = c / (n σ c) ) = 1/(n σ). \n\nWait, no. Wait, the mean free path is the average distance traveled before interaction. The interaction rate Γ is the number of interactions per unit time: Γ = n σ v. For photons, v = c. So, Γ = n σ c. The mean free path is then λ = c * τ = c / Γ = 1/(n σ). \n\nSo, λ = 1/(n σ). \n\nGiven n = 300 cm^-3, σ = 2.217e-25 cm². \n\nSo, λ = 1 / (300 cm^-3 * 2.217e-25 cm²) \n\nCompute denominator: 300 * 2.217e-25 = 6.651e-23 cm^-1 \n\nSo, λ = 1 / 6.651e-23 cm^-1 ≈ 1.504e22 cm \n\nConvert to parsecs or megaparsecs? Let's convert to meters first. \n\n1 cm = 0.01 meters, so 1.504e22 cm = 1.504e20 meters. \n\n1 light-year ≈ 9.461e15 meters. \n\nSo, 1.504e20 / 9.461e15 ≈ 1.589e4 light-years. \n\nBut the size of the universe is much larger. Wait, but this seems inconsistent. Wait, 1.5e4 light-years is a very small distance on cosmological scales. The Milky Way is about 100,000 light-years in diameter. But the mean free path we calculated is 15,000 light-years. However, earlier we found the lifetime τ ≈ 1.6e4 years, so the distance traveled would be c * τ = 1.6e4 light-years. Which matches. \n\nBut the problem is part (c) asks how this compares with the size of the universe. The size of the observable universe is about 93 billion light-years in diameter, but the age is about 13.8 billion years. Wait, but if the mean free path is 1.6e4 light-years, then it's much smaller than the size of the universe, which is ~1e10 light-years. Therefore, the γ-rays can't travel far. \n\nBut wait, this seems contradictory because if the cross-section is constant, then the mean free path is independent of energy. But in reality, the cross-section for pair production is only significant above the threshold energy. So, for γ-rays below the threshold, the cross-section is zero, and they can travel freely. But once above threshold, they have this mean free path. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the cross-section is σ_T/3 regardless of energy? That's an approximation. So, assuming that once the photon is above threshold, the cross-section is σ_T/3. Therefore, the mean free path is as calculated. \n\nSo, the average distance traveled is λ ≈ 1.5e4 light-years. \n\nBut let's compute it properly. \n\nλ = 1/(n σ) \n\nn = 300 cm^-3 = 3e2 cm^-3 \n\nσ = 2.217e-25 cm² \n\nSo, n σ = 3e2 * 2.217e-25 = 6.651e-23 cm^-1 \n\nBut 1 cm^-1 is 1 per cm, so λ = 1 / 6.651e-23 cm = 1.504e22 cm \n\nConvert cm to kilometers: 1.504e22 cm = 1.504e20 meters = 1.504e17 kilometers. \n\nBut 1 light-year is about 9.461e12 km. \n\nSo, 1.504e17 km / 9.461e12 km/ly ≈ 15.9e4 ly ≈ 1.59e5 ly? Wait, wait, let me check again. \n\nWait, 1.504e22 cm = 1.504e20 meters = 1.504e17 kilometers. \n\n1 light-year = 9.461e12 km. \n\nSo, 1.504e17 km / 9.461e12 km/ly ≈ (1.504 / 9.461) * 1e5 ≈ 0.159 * 1e5 ≈ 1.59e4 ly. \n\nYes, 15,900 light-years. \n\nSo, the average distance traveled is approximately 1.6e4 light-years. \n\nBut the size of the universe is much larger, so the answer to (c) is that the mean free path is much smaller than the size of the universe, hence the γ-rays can't travel far. \n\nBut let's proceed step by step. \n\nPart (a) answer: γ-rays with energy ~2.6e14 eV (260 TeV) or higher would have their lifetimes limited by pair production. \n\nPart (b) average distance: ~1.6e4 light-years. \n\nPart (c) comparison: The size of the universe is ~1e10 light-years, so the distance is much smaller. \n\nPart (d): What limits the lifetime of ultra-high-energy protons (≥1e20 eV)? Since photon-proton scattering is negligible, the main process would be photopion production. Protons interacting with CMB photons can produce pions via p + γ → π + p (or n + π+ etc.). The threshold for this process is higher than for electron-positron pair production, but at 1e20 eV, the proton's energy is sufficient to interact with CMB photons to produce pions, which would cause energy loss and limit the proton's lifetime. \n\nSo, putting it all together: \n\n(a) The threshold energy is ~260 TeV, so γ-rays around this energy or higher are affected. \n\n(b) The mean free path is ~1.6e4 light-years. \n\n(c) This is much smaller than the size of the universe (~93 billion light-years), so they don't travel far. \n\n(d) Photopion production with CMB photons. \n\nNow, let's verify the calculations again. \n\nFor part (a), the threshold energy E_γ = (m_e c²)^2 / ε. \n\nm_e c² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV \n\nε = 1e-3 eV \n\nE_γ = (0.511e6)^2 / 1e-3 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 / 1e-3 = 0.261 * 1e15 = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV. \n\nYes. \n\nFor part (b), the mean free path λ = 1/(n σ). \n\nn = 300 cm^-3 = 3e2 cm^-3 \n\nσ = σ_T /3 = 6.65e-25 cm² /3 ≈ 2.217e-25 cm² \n\nλ = 1/(3e2 * 2.217e-25) = 1/(6.651e-23) cm ≈ 1.504e22 cm \n\nConvert to light-years: \n\n1 cm = 1e-5 km \n\n1.504e22 cm = 1.504e17 km \n\n1 light-year ≈ 9.461e12 km \n\nSo, 1.504e17 / 9.461e12 ≈ 1.59e4 light-years. \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, the answers are: \n\n(a) ~2.6e14 eV \n\n(b) ~1.6e4 light-years \n\n(c) Much smaller \n\n(d) Photopion production \n\nBut let's check part (d) again. The process for protons is different. At such high energies (1e20 eV), the proton's Lorentz factor γ is E/(m_p c²) ≈ 1e20 eV / (1e9 eV) = 1e11. So, the proton's γ is ~1e11. The CMB photon energy in the proton's rest frame is γ * ε. ε = 1e-3 eV, so in the proton's frame, it's 1e11 * 1e-3 eV = 1e8 eV = 100 MeV. Which is enough to produce pions (the pion mass is ~140 MeV). Wait, 100 MeV is below the pion mass. Wait, the threshold for pion production is when the photon energy in the proton's rest frame is at least the pion mass. So, the photon energy in the proton's rest frame must be ≥ m_π c² ≈ 140 MeV. \n\nSo, solving γ * ε ≥ m_π c² \n\nγ ≥ m_π c² / ε \n\nm_π c² ≈ 140 MeV = 1.4e8 eV \n\nε = 1e-3 eV \n\nγ ≥ 1.4e8 / 1e-3 = 1.4e11 \n\nThe proton's Lorentz factor γ = E_p / (m_p c²). m_p c² ≈ 938 MeV ≈ 1e9 eV. \n\nSo, E_p = γ * m_p c² = 1.4e11 * 1e9 eV = 1.4e20 eV. \n\nTherefore, protons with energy ≥1.4e20 eV would interact with CMB photons to produce pions. The problem states energy ≥1e20 eV, which is near this threshold. Therefore, the process is photopion production. \n\nSo, part (d) answer is photopion production. \n\nFinal answers: \n\n(a) The energy is approximately 2.6 × 10¹⁴ eV. \n\n(b) The average distance is approximately 1.6 × 10⁴ light-years. \n\n(c) This distance is much smaller than the size of the universe. \n\n(d) Photopion production with CMB photons.\n</think>\n\n(a) The threshold energy for pair production is determined by the condition \\( E_\\gamma \\cdot \\epsilon \\geq (m_e c^2)^2 \\), where \\( \\epsilon \\sim 10^{-3} \\, \\text{eV} \\) is the CMB photon energy.

{"id": "atomic/3-27", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these decay rate ratio problems one by one. I need to remember the selection rules and the types of interactions involved in each decay. Let's start with part (a).\n\n**Problem (a):** \\( \\frac{K^+ \\rightarrow \\pi^+\\pi^0}{K^0_s \\rightarrow \\pi^+\\pi^-} \\)\n\nFirst, I recall that kaons can decay via the weak interaction. But wait, some kaon decays might be allowed by the strong interaction if they conserve the necessary quantum numbers. However, the decay of kaons into pions... Hmm, kaons are pseudoscalar mesons (spin 0), and pions are also pseudoscalar. So for two-pion decays, the total angular momentum would be zero. The parity of the initial state (K) is negative (since pseudoscalar), and the parity of two pions would be (+1)(+1) = +1 (since each pion has parity -1, but two of them: (-1)^2 = +1). Wait, wait, parity of a pion is -1. So two pions would have parity (-1)^2 = +1. The kaon has parity -1. So the parity of the initial state is -1, and the final state is +1. So parity is violated. Therefore, this decay cannot proceed via the strong interaction (which conserves parity) or electromagnetic (which also conserves parity). So these decays must be weak interactions. But wait, wait, but the K → ππ decays are known to be mediated by the weak interaction. However, there's a selection rule here related to the ΔI = 1/2 rule. The K+ → π+π0 and K0 → π+π- (like K_S^0) decays. The ΔI = 1/2 rule states that the weak interaction prefers ΔI = 1/2 transitions. For K+ → π+π0: The initial K+ has I=1/2, I3=+1/2. The final state is two pions. The pions are I=1 each. Combining two I=1 states can give total isospin 0, 1, or 2. For π+ and π0: The π+ is I=1, I3=+1; π0 is I=1, I3=0. So the combined isospin is the sum. Let's compute the possible total I. The combination of π+ (I3=+1) and π0 (I3=0) gives a total I3=+1. The possible total I must have I3=+1. The possible I for two pions here would be I=2 (since I3 can go up to +2 for I=2) or I=1. But for I=1, the maximum I3 is +1, so this combination could be part of an I=1 multiplet. So the final state can have I=1 or I=2. The initial K+ has I=1/2. The weak interaction can induce ΔI=1/2 or 3/2. But the ΔI=1/2 rule says that the amplitude for ΔI=1/2 is dominant. So for K+ → π+π0: The transition would need to go from I=1/2 to a final state with I=1 or 2. If the weak interaction is ΔI=1/2, then the initial I=1/2 would lead to final states with I=1/2 ± 1/2, so I=0 or 1. But the two-pion state here can't have I=0 because for two pions, the symmetric state (since they are bosons) with I=0 would require even permutation, but maybe not. Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully. The two-pion system must be symmetric under exchange. Since pions are bosons, their wavefunction must be symmetric. The isospin part must combine with spatial and spin parts. Since the decay is to two pions with zero angular momentum (since the kaon is spin 0, the pions must be in s-wave, so L=0, symmetric spatial part). So the isospin wavefunction must be symmetric. For two pions, each with I=1, the symmetric combinations are I=0 and I=2. Because the isospin states for two I=1 particles: symmetric under exchange are I=0 (antisymmetric in some way?) Wait, actually, the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition for two I=1 states: 1⊗1 = 2 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 0. The symmetric states are I=2 and I=0, and the antisymmetric is I=1. Wait, no. Wait, the combination of two identical bosons (pions) must be symmetric under exchange. So the isospin part must be symmetric. So the allowed total isospin for two pions is I=0 (symmetric) and I=2 (symmetric), while I=1 is antisymmetric. Therefore, the two-pion state must have I=0 or I=2. So for K+ → π+π0: The initial kaon has I=1/2. The weak interaction can induce ΔI=1/2 or 3/2. To reach a final state with I=0 or 2, starting from I=1/2. Let's see: If the weak interaction is ΔI=1/2, then the transition would be I_initial = 1/2 → I_final = 1/2 ± 1/2 = 0 or 1. But the two-pion state can only have I=0 or 2. So if the weak interaction is ΔI=1/2, then the final state must have I=0 (since 1/2 - 1/2 = 0). But the two-pion state here (π+π0) can't be in I=0. Because the I=0 state for two pions is (π+π- - π-π+ + π0π0)/√3 or something like that. Wait, the I=0 state for two pions is symmetric and is proportional to the combination where all three possible pairs are included. Wait, actually, the I=0 state for two pions is (π+π- + π-π+ + π0π0)/√3. But in the case of π+π0, since the two pions are charged and neutral, their combination can't be part of the I=0 state. Because the I=0 state requires all three charge combinations. So the π+π0 state must have I=1 or I=2. Wait, but earlier conclusion was that two pions must have I=0 or 2. But if the two pions are π+ and π0, which have I3 = +1 and 0, then the total I3 is +1. The possible I for the two-pion system must have I ≥ I3, so I ≥1. But since the two-pion system must be symmetric (I=0 or 2), but I=0 has I3=0, which doesn't match. So the π+π0 combination must have I=2, with I3=+1. Because for I=2, the I3 can be +2, +1, 0, -1, -2. So π+π0 is part of the I=2 multiplet. Therefore, the final state has I=2. The initial K+ has I=1/2. To get from I=1/2 to I=2, the weak interaction would need ΔI = 3/2. But the ΔI=1/2 rule says that the dominant transitions are ΔI=1/2. Therefore, the amplitude for K+ → π+π0 is suppressed because it requires ΔI=3/2. On the other hand, the decay K_S^0 → π+π-: The K_S^0 is a combination of K^0 and anti-K^0, but let's consider the isospin. The K^0 is part of the I=1/2 doublet. The decay K_S^0 → π+π-: The two pions here can be in I=0 or I=2. The I=0 state is allowed. If the weak interaction is ΔI=1/2, then the transition from I=1/2 (K^0) to I=0 (two pions) is possible. Therefore, the amplitude for K_S^0 → π+π- is allowed under ΔI=1/2. Therefore, the ratio of decay rates would be proportional to the square of the amplitudes. Since K+ decay requires ΔI=3/2 amplitude, which is suppressed compared to ΔI=1/2. The ratio would then be something like (A_{3/2} / A_{1/2})^2. But I need to recall the actual ratio. Experimentally, the K+ → π+π0 decay is much less probable than K_S → π+π-. The ratio is about 1/450 or so, but I need to express this in terms of fundamental constants. Wait, but the problem says to use selection rules and express in terms of G, α, θ_c (Cabibbo angle), m_K, etc. The weak interaction coupling is proportional to G_F (Fermi constant) times sinθ_c or cosθ_c depending on the quark content. Let's think about the quark content. K+ is u s̄. Decaying to π+ (u d̄) and π0 ( (u ū - d d̄)/√2 ). So the decay K+ → π+π0 would involve the s quark decaying. The weak interaction for K+ decay would be s → u via a charged current, emitting a W+, which then pairs with the u antiquark? Wait, maybe better to think in terms of the effective Hamiltonian. The weak interaction for strangeness-changing decays (ΔS=1) is governed by the Cabibbo angle. The amplitude would be proportional to sinθ_c for some decays and cosθ_c for others. For K+ → π+π0: The quark process is s → u + W-, and the W- would pair with a u quark from the sea? Wait, perhaps the decay is sū → (u d̄)( (u ū - d d̄)/√2 ). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the decay could proceed via the ΔI=3/2 and ΔI=1/2 amplitudes. The ratio of the amplitudes is given by the ratio of the ΔI=3/2 to ΔI=1/2 amplitudes. Let me recall that in kaon decays, the ΔI=1/2 amplitude is dominant. The actual ratio of the decay rates is Γ(K+ → π+π0)/Γ(K0 → π+π-) ≈ 1/450. But how to express this in terms of fundamental constants? The amplitude for ΔI=1/2 is proportional to G_F sinθ_c times some factor, and ΔI=3/2 is proportional to G_F sinθ_c times a smaller factor. But since the problem says to assume strong interactions have unit coupling, but weak interactions would have couplings involving G, α (electromagnetic), etc. Wait, but both decays here are weak, so the ratio would depend on the squares of the weak amplitudes. The ΔI=1/2 amplitude is larger, so the K_S decay (which can proceed via ΔI=1/2) has a larger rate. The K+ decay must proceed via ΔI=3/2, which is suppressed. The ratio would then be (A_3/2 / A_1/2)^2. But how to express A_3/2 and A_1/2 in terms of fundamental constants? Maybe the amplitudes are proportional to G_F times some combination of Cabibbo angles. For example, the s → u transition is proportional to sinθ_c. But perhaps the ΔI=1/2 and ΔI=3/2 amplitudes have different factors. Wait, the effective Hamiltonian for ΔS=1 decays can be written in terms of operators transforming under different isospin representations. The ΔI=1/2 part is dominant. The ratio of the amplitudes would be A_3/2 / A_1/2 ≈ ε, where ε is a small parameter. Experimentally, this ratio is about 1/22, so the square is ~1/450. But how to express ε in terms of fundamental constants? Maybe it's related to the ratio of some couplings, but I'm not sure. The problem might expect us to state that the ratio is approximately (θ_c)^2 or something, but θ_c is the Cabibbo angle (~13 degrees), sinθ_c ≈ 0.22. But I don't think that's directly applicable here. Alternatively, since both decays are weak, and the selection rule is ΔI=1/2 dominance, the K+ decay (ΔI=3/2) is suppressed relative to K_S (ΔI=1/2). Therefore, the ratio is approximately (A_3/2 / A_1/2)^2, which is a small number. But without specific factors, maybe we just state the ratio is of order (G_F^2 sin^2θ_c) / (G_F^2 sin^2θ_c) ) times some isospin factor. Wait, but both decays are ΔS=1, so same G_F and sinθ_c factors. Then the ratio is purely from the isospin amplitudes. The amplitude for K+ → π+π0 is proportional to A_3/2, and for K_S → π+π- is proportional to A_1/2. Therefore, the ratio is |A_3/2 / A_1/2|^2. But the problem says to express in terms of fundamental constants if possible. Since the ΔI=1/2 enhancement is a phenomenological rule, not derived from first principles, perhaps we can't express it in terms of G, α, etc., but just state that the ratio is suppressed due to ΔI=1/2 rule, and the decay is weak for both. So the answer would be the ratio is approximately (A_3/2 / A_1/2)^2, which is a small number, and both decays are weak. But maybe there's a more precise way. Alternatively, considering the decay amplitudes in terms of isospin. Let's model the amplitudes. The K+ is part of an isospin doublet (I=1/2, I3=+1/2). The two-pion states can be in I=0 or I=2. The decay amplitude can be decomposed into isospin amplitudes A_0 and A_2 (for I=0 and I=2 final states). The physical decay amplitudes are combinations of these. For K+ → π+π0: The final state has I=2 and I3=+1. So the amplitude is proportional to A_2. For K_S^0 → π+π-: The K_S is a mixture of K^0 and K̄^0, but let's consider the isospin. The K^0 has I=1/2, I3=-1/2. The decay to π+π- can be a combination of I=0 and I=2. The amplitude would be a combination of A_0 and A_2. However, the ΔI=1/2 rule implies that A_0 >> A_2. Therefore, the amplitude for K_S → π+π- is dominated by A_0. Therefore, the ratio Γ(K+→π+π0)/Γ(K_S→π+π-) ≈ |A_2 / A_0|^2. Since A_2 is much smaller than A_0 due to ΔI=1/2 rule, the ratio is small. But how to express this in terms of fundamental constants? Maybe the ratio is of order (m_K^2 / (16π^2 f_π^2)) or something related to chiral perturbation theory, but I think the problem expects us to state the selection rule (ΔI=1/2) and note that the ratio is suppressed because K+ decay requires ΔI=3/2, hence the ratio is |A_3/2 / A_1/2|^2, which is a small number. Since the problem says to state the selection rules and the type of decay, both are weak, and the ratio is governed by the ΔI=1/2 rule. So the answer would be that the ratio is much less than 1 due to the ΔI=1/2 selection rule (phenomenological), and both decays are weak. But the exact expression? Maybe the ratio is approximately (sinθ_c)^2 / (something), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the amplitude for ΔI=1/2 is dominant, the ratio is approximately (A_3/2 / A_1/2)^2, which is a small number, and since the problem allows expressing in terms of fundamental constants, perhaps we can write it as something like (G_{ΔI=3/2} / G_{ΔI=1/2})^2, but since the strong coupling is 1, and weak is G, maybe not. Alternatively, since both are weak, the ratio is just a numerical factor from isospin, but I need to compute it. Let's try to compute the isospin factors. The amplitude for K → ππ can be written using isospin. The initial kaon is in I=1/2. The final two-pion state is in I=0 or I=2. The weak Hamiltonian must transform as I=1/2 (since ΔI=1/2) or I=3/2 (ΔI=3/2). The matrix element ⟨ππ(I) | H_w | K(I=1/2)⟩. For H_w with ΔI=1/2, the Hamiltonian has I=1/2. So the matrix element would be non-zero only if the final state can be reached by combining I=1/2 (H_w) with I=1/2 (initial K). The combination of H_w (I=1/2) and K (I=1/2) can lead to final states with I=0 or 1. But the two-pion states have I=0 or 2. So only I=0 is possible for ΔI=1/2. Therefore, the amplitude A_0 is from ΔI=1/2. The amplitude A_2 must come from ΔI=3/2. Therefore, the ratio of amplitudes A_2/A_0 is the ratio of ΔI=3/2 to ΔI=1/2 amplitudes. Let's denote this ratio as ε = A_2/A_0. Then the decay rate ratio Γ(K+→π+π0)/Γ(K_S→π+π-) is proportional to |A_2|^2 / |A_0|^2 = ε^2. Experimentally, ε is about 1/22, so ε^2 ≈ 1/484, which is roughly the observed ratio. But how to express ε in terms of fundamental constants? I think this is a phenomenological parameter, not expressible in terms of G, α, etc. Therefore, the answer is that the ratio is approximately ε^2 where ε is the ratio of ΔI=3/2 to ΔI=1/2 amplitudes, governed by the ΔI=1/2 selection rule (phenomenological), and both decays are weak. But the problem says to express in terms of fundamental constants if possible. Maybe there's a way to relate ε to the Cabibbo angle? Not directly, since the Cabibbo angle is part of the CKM matrix, which determines the strength of the weak interactions, but both decays involve the same CKM factor (sinθ_c), so it cancels in the ratio. Therefore, the ratio is just a numerical factor from isospin breaking, but since the strong interactions have unit coupling, maybe it's a pure number. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio involves a factor from the different isospin Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Let's compute the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the decays. For K+ → π+π0: The initial state is |K+⟩ = |I=1/2, I3=+1/2⟩. The final state is |π+π0⟩. The two pions are in an I=2, I3=+1 state. The amplitude is proportional to ⟨I=2, I3=+1 | H_w | I=1/2, I3=+1/2⟩. If H_w has ΔI=3/2, then H_w transforms as I=3/2, I3= +1/2 (since initial I3=1/2, final I3=1). The matrix element would involve a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. Similarly, for K_S → π+π-, the final state is a combination of I=0 and I=2. The amplitude from ΔI=1/2 would contribute to the I=0 part. Let's attempt to compute the ratio. The amplitude for K+ → π+π0 is A_2, and for K_S → π+π- is A_0 multiplied by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for I=0. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients might give a factor. For example, the amplitude for K+ → π+π0 is proportional to ⟨I=2, I3=1 | H_w | I=1/2, I3=1/2⟩. Assuming H_w has I=3/2 (ΔI=3/2), then the matrix element would involve the CG coefficient for combining I=1/2 (kaon) and I=3/2 (H_w) to get I=2 (final state). The CG coefficient for (1/2, 1/2) and (3/2, 1/2) combining to (2,1). Let me look up the CG coefficient. Alternatively, since this is getting complicated, maybe the ratio of the amplitudes is sqrt(3/2) or something. Wait, another approach: The decay amplitudes can be parametrized using isospin. The amplitude for K → ππ is given by A^{I} where I is the isospin of the final state. For K+ → π+π0, the amplitude is A^{2} multiplied by a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. For K_S → π+π-, the amplitude is A^{0} multiplied by another CG coefficient. The ratio of the amplitudes would then be [A^{2} * CG1] / [A^{0} * CG2]. The CG coefficients can be calculated. Let's see: For K+ (I=1/2, I3=+1/2) decaying to π+ (I=1, I3=+1) and π0 (I=1, I3=0). The final state has total I3=+1. The possible isospin states are I=2 and I=1 (but earlier conclusion was that only I=2 is allowed due to symmetry). The CG coefficient for combining two I=1 states to I=2, I3=1 is sqrt(2/3). Because the state |2,1⟩ is (|1,1⟩|1,0⟩ + |1,0⟩|1,1⟩)/sqrt(2) multiplied by sqrt(2/3). Wait, actually, the CG coefficients for combining two I=1 states: To get |I=2, I3=1⟩, the combination is sqrt(1/2) |1,1⟩|1,0⟩ + sqrt(1/2) |1,0⟩|1,1⟩. But considering the pions are identical particles, the state must be symmetric. The spatial part is symmetric (s-wave), spin is zero (pions are spin 0), so the isospin part must be symmetric. The I=2 states are symmetric, I=1 antisymmetric, I=0 symmetric. Therefore, the π+π0 state must be in I=2. The CG coefficient for I=2, I3=1 is sqrt(1/2)( |1,1⟩|1,0⟩ + |1,0⟩|1,1⟩ ). The normalization is sqrt(1/2) * sqrt(2) = 1. Wait, the CG coefficient for combining |1,1⟩ and |1,0⟩ to |2,1⟩ is sqrt(1/2). Therefore, the amplitude for K+ → π+π0 is A_2 * sqrt(1/2). For K_S → π+π-, the final state is a combination of I=0 and I=2. The I=0 state is (|1,1⟩|1,-1⟩ + |1,-1⟩|1,1⟩ - |1,0⟩|1,0⟩)/sqrt(3). The amplitude for K_S → π+π- (I=0) is A_0 * sqrt(1/3). Because the CG coefficient for the I=0 state would involve 1/sqrt(3). Therefore, the ratio of amplitudes is [A_2 * sqrt(1/2)] / [A_0 * sqrt(1/3)] = (A_2 / A_0) * sqrt(3/2). Then the ratio of decay rates is (A_2 / A_0)^2 * (3/2). But the problem states that the ΔI=1/2 rule makes A_0 >> A_2, so A_2/A_0 is small. Let's denote ε = A_2/A_0. Then the ratio is (3/2) ε^2. If ε is small (like 1/22), then the ratio is (3/2)(1/484) ≈ 3/968 ≈ 1/323, which is in the ballpark of the experimental value (~1/450). But the exact value isn't critical here; the key point is the ratio is suppressed by (ε)^2, and the selection rule is ΔI=1/2 (phenomenological). Therefore, the answer is that the ratio is approximately (3/2)(A_2/A_0)^2, which is small due to the ΔI=1/2 rule, and both decays are weak. But since the problem asks to express in terms of fundamental constants if possible, and A_2/A_0 is a phenomenological parameter not directly expressible in terms of G, α, etc., we might just state the ratio is of order (G^2) but since both are weak, the G cancels, leaving a numerical factor. Alternatively, since the strong interactions have unit coupling, and the weak is G, but both decays are weak, the ratio doesn't involve G. So the answer is the ratio is small due to the ΔI=1/2 rule, expressed as a phenomenological selection rule, and both decays are weak. The exact ratio would involve the square of the ratio of the ΔI=3/2 amplitude to the ΔI=1/2 amplitude, multiplied by Clebsch-Gordan factors. So the final answer is:\n\n(a) The ratio is suppressed by the ΔI=1/2 selection rule (phenomenological), with Γ(K+→π+π0)/Γ(K_S→π+π^-) ≈ (3/2)|A_3/2 / A_1/2|^2, both decays are weak. But since the problem wants the answer in terms of fundamental constants, and I can't express A_3/2/A_1/2 in such terms, maybe just state the ratio is of order α^2 or something? Wait, no. Electromagnetic interactions are α, but these are weak decays. So perhaps the answer is:\n\nThe ratio is approximately \\(\\frac{3}{2} \\left( \\frac{G_{ΔI=3/2}}{G_{ΔI=1/2}} \\right)^2\\), but since both are weak processes with the same G, this reduces to a numerical factor. However, the ΔI=1/2 rule is phenomenological, so we can't derive it from fundamental constants. Therefore, the answer is that the ratio is much less than 1 due to the ΔI=1/2 rule, both decays are weak, and the ratio cannot be expressed in terms of fundamental constants beyond the phenomenological selection rule.\n\nBut the problem says \"if at all possible, express your answer in terms of the fundamental constants\". Since it's not possible here, we just state the selection rule and the ratio is small. However, I recall that in the Standard Model, the ΔI=1/2 rule arises from QCD corrections enhancing the ΔI=1/2 amplitudes, but this is a calculation-dependent effect and not expressible in simple terms of constants. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(a) The decay \\(K^+ \\rightarrow \\pi^+\\pi^0\\) is suppressed by the ΔI=1/2 selection rule (phenomenological) compared to \\(K^0_s \\rightarrow \\pi^+\\pi^-\\). Both decays are weak. The ratio is approximately \\(\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2} \\left| \\frac{A_{3/2}}{A_{1/2}} \\right|^2}\\), where \\(A_{1/2}\\) and \\(A_{3/2}\\) are the ΔI=1/2 and ΔI=3/2 amplitudes, respectively.\n\nBut since the problem might expect a numerical factor, but without specific values, perhaps just state the ratio is small and governed by the ΔI=1/2 rule. However, given the options, I'll proceed to the next parts and see if there's a pattern.\n\n**Problem (b):** \\( \\frac{\\rho^0 \\rightarrow \\pi^0\\pi^0}{\\rho^0 \\rightarrow \\pi^+\\pi^-} \\)\n\nThe ρ^0 is a vector meson (spin 1) made of uū - d d̄ (I=1, I3=0). Decays to two pions. The ρ meson decays via the strong interaction because its lifetime is very short (~1e-24 s). The decay ρ^0 → π+π- is allowed, but ρ^0 → π0π0 is forbidden. Why? Because the two π0s are identical bosons. The ρ^0 has spin 1, so the decay must conserve angular momentum. The two pions are spin 0, so their total spin is 0. The orbital angular momentum must be L=1 to match the ρ's spin (J=1). The spatial wavefunction for L=1 is antisymmetric under exchange. The pions are bosons, so the total wavefunction must be symmetric. The isospin part: ρ^0 is I=1, I3=0. Two π0s have I=2 (each π0 is I=1, I3=0; combining them symmetrically gives I=2, I3=0). But the ρ^0 has I=1, so the decay ρ^0 → π0π0 would require ΔI=1, which is allowed by strong interaction (since strong interactions conserve isospin). Wait, but wait, the isospin of the two-pion system. For two π0s, which are each I=1, I3=0. The combined isospin can be I=0, 1, or 2. The symmetric combination (since the pions are identical) would be I=0 and I=2. The ρ^0 has I=1, so the decay ρ^0 → ππ must have the two pions in I=1. But symmetric states (I=0,2) are not I=1. Therefore, the isospin conservation forbids ρ^0 → π0π0. Because the two π0s must be in I=0 or 2, but the ρ^0 is I=1. Therefore, the decay ρ^0 → π0π0 is forbidden by isospin conservation (a fundamental selection rule). The decay ρ^0 → π+π- is allowed because the two pions can be in I=1. Let's check: π+ (I=1, I3=+1) and π- (I=1, I3=-1). Combining these can give I=0,1,2. The I=1 state with I3=0 is (|1,1⟩|1,-1⟩ - |1,-1⟩|1,1⟩)/sqrt(2) plus a term with |1,0⟩|1,0⟩. Wait, actually, the I=1, I3=0 state for two pions is (π+π- - π-π+)/sqrt(2) + something with π0π0? No, because for two pions, the I=1 state must be antisymmetric under exchange. But pions are bosons, so their wavefunction must be symmetric. The isospin part for I=1 is antisymmetric, which combined with symmetric spatial (L=0) would make the total wavefunction antisymmetric, which is not allowed. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. The ρ^0 has J=1, I=1. Decays to two pions (J=0 each), so L=1. The spatial part is P-wave (L=1), which is antisymmetric under exchange. The isospin part must be symmetric to make the total wavefunction symmetric (since the pions are bosons). The ρ^0 is I=1, so the two-pion system must also be I=1. But for two I=1 particles, the symmetric isospin states are I=0 and I=2. The I=1 state is antisymmetric. Therefore, the isospin part for I=1 is antisymmetric, and the spatial part is antisymmetric (L=1). So total wavefunction is symmetric (antisymmetric * antisymmetric = symmetric). Therefore, the decay ρ^0 → π+π- is allowed because the isospin can be I=1 (antisymmetric) and spatial part antisymmetric, making the total symmetric. However, for ρ^0 → π0π0, the two π0s are identical. The isospin must be symmetric (I=0 or 2), but the ρ^0 has I=1. Therefore, the decay ρ^0 → π0π0 is forbidden by isospin conservation. Hence, the ratio is zero. Therefore, the ratio Γ(ρ^0→π0π0)/Γ(ρ^0→π+π^-) = 0. The selection rule is isospin conservation (fundamental, since strong interactions conserve isospin), and the decay is strong for both. So the answer is zero.\n\n(b) The ratio is zero due to isospin conservation (fundamental selection rule). Both decays are strong. So the answer is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).\n\n**Problem (c):** \\( \\frac{K^0_L \\rightarrow \\mu^+ \\mu^-}{K^0_L \\rightarrow \\pi^0\\pi^0} \\)\n\nK^0_L is a long-lived neutral kaon, which is a mixture of K^0 and K̄^0. The decay K_L → μ+μ- is a leptonic decay, while K_L → π0π0 is a hadronic decay. Let's determine the interaction types. The leptonic decay K → μ+μ- is a weak process (similar to K+ → μ+ν). The decay K_L → π0π0 is a CP-violating decay because K_L is mostly CP-odd, and ππ is CP-even. Normally, K_L → ππ is CP-violating and proceeds via weak interaction. The K_L → π0π0 decay is thus a weak decay with a small branching ratio. The K_L → μ+μ- decay is also weak. However, the rates depend on different factors. The ratio would involve the weak couplings and possibly loop factors. The decay K_L → μ+μ- is a flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) process, which is loop-suppressed in the Standard Model (GIM mechanism). The decay K_L → π0π0 is a ΔS=1 weak decay, but CP-violating. The amplitudes for both are weak, but let's estimate the ratio. The decay K_L → π0π0 has a rate proportional to G_F^2 (weak coupling squared) and a CP-violating parameter η (which is a small parameter, ~1e-3). The decay K_L → μ+μ- is also proportional to G_F^2, but involves a different combination of couplings (e.g., the leptonic current). The ratio would then be [G_F^2 (α^2 m_K^2 ... ) ] / [G_F^2 η^2 ... ] ~ (α^2 / η^2) * (m_K^2 / ... ). But to express this in terms of fundamental constants, perhaps the dominant factor is the CP violation parameter η, which is of order 1e-3. However, η itself is a combination of CKM factors. Alternatively, the decay K_L → π0π0 is proportional to the CP violation parameter ε_K, which is ~2e-3. The decay K_L → μ+μ- has a branching ratio ~7e-9, while K_L → π0π0 is ~9e-4. So the ratio is approximately (7e-9)/(9e-4) ≈ 8e-6. But how to express this in terms of fundamental constants? The μ+μ- decay is a second-order weak process (box diagrams) involving the top quark and W loops, but the exact expression would involve G_F^2, m_t^2, etc. However, the problem might expect us to note that K_L → μ+μ- is an electromagnetic process? No, it's weak. K_L → π0π0 is weak. The ratio would involve the square of the CP violation parameter (", "final_answers": ["\\frac{3}{2} \\left| \\frac{A_{3/2}}{A_{1/2}} \\right|^2", "0"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{3}{2} \\left| \\frac{A_{3/2}}{A_{1/2}} \\right|^2", "expr2": "\\frac{K^+ \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^0}{K^0_s \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-} \\approx 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": "I expected one of these: '}'\n\\frac{K^+ \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^0}{K^0 \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-} \\approx 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\n~~~~~~~^"}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{3}{2} \\left| \\frac{A_{3/2}}{A_{1/2}} \\right|^2", "expr2": "\\frac{\\rho^0 \\to \\pi^0 \\pi^0}{\\rho^0 \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-} \\approx 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": "I expected one of these: '}'\n\\frac{\\rho^0 \\to \\pi^0 \\pi^0}{\\rho^0 \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-} \\approx 0\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~^"}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{3}{2} \\left| \\frac{A_{3/2}}{A_{1/2}} \\right|^2", "expr2": "\\frac{K^0_L \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-}{K^0_L \\to \\pi^0 \\pi^0} \\approx 10^{-5}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": "I expected one of these: '}'\n\\frac{K^0 \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-}{K^0 \\to \\pi^0 \\pi^0} \\approx 10^{-5}\n~~~~~~~~~~^"}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{3}{2} \\left| \\frac{A_{3/2}}{A_{1/2}} \\right|^2", "expr2": "\\frac{K^+ \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^+ e^- \\nu}{K^- \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^- e^- \\nu} = 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "3/2", "expr2": "0"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{3}{2} \\left| \\frac{A_{3/2}}{A_{1/2}} \\right|^2", "expr2": "\\frac{\\Omega^- \\to \\Sigma^- \\pi^0}{\\Omega^- \\to \\Xi^0 \\pi^-} = 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "3/2", "expr2": "0"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{3}{2} \\left| \\frac{A_{3/2}}{A_{1/2}} \\right|^2", "expr2": "\\frac{\\eta^0 \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-}{\\eta^0 \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0} = 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "3/2", "expr2": "0"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{3}{2} \\left| \\frac{A_{3/2}}{A_{1/2}} \\right|^2", "expr2": "\\frac{\\Lambda^0 \\to K^-\\pi^+}{\\Lambda^0 \\to p\\pi^-} = 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "3/2", "expr2": "0"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{3}{2} \\left| \\frac{A_{3/2}}{A_{1/2}} \\right|^2", "expr2": "\\frac{\\theta^0 \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0}{\\omega^0 \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0} = 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "3/2", "expr2": "0"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{3}{2} \\left| \\frac{A_{3/2}}{A_{1/2}} \\right|^2", "expr2": "\\frac{\\Sigma^- \\to \\Lambda^0 \\pi^-}{\\Sigma^- \\to n \\pi^-} = 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "3/2", "expr2": "0"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{3}{2} \\left| \\frac{A_{3/2}}{A_{1/2}} \\right|^2", "expr2": "\\frac{\\pi^- \\to e^- \\nu}{K^+ \\to \\mu^+ \\nu} = 1.35 \\times 10^{-4}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "3/2", "expr2": "0.000135000000000000"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "0", "expr2": "\\frac{K^+ \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^0}{K^0_s \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-} \\approx 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": "I expected one of these: '}'\n\\frac{K^+ \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^0}{K^0 \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-} \\approx 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\n~~~~~~~^"}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "0", "expr2": "\\frac{\\rho^0 \\to \\pi^0 \\pi^0}{\\rho^0 \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-} \\approx 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": "I expected one of these: '}'\n\\frac{\\rho^0 \\to \\pi^0 \\pi^0}{\\rho^0 \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-} \\approx 0\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~^"}], "accuracy": 0.5}
{"id": "atomic/4-30", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The question is asking for the lifetime and mean decay distance of a 5 GeV ρ⁰ meson. Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a particle can be related to its width via the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is given as 154 MeV. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the lifetime τ to the width through Γ ≈ ħ/τ. But wait, units might be tricky here. Let me recall the exact formula. The relation is τ = ħ / Γ, where Γ is the total decay width. Since ħ in natural units is 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. But Γ is given in MeV, so I need to convert that to GeV. 154 MeV is 0.154 GeV. So τ = (6.582×10^-25 GeV·s) / (0.154 GeV) ≈ 4.27×10^-24 seconds. That seems really short, which makes sense because the ρ meson is a resonance with a very short lifetime.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"lifetime\", so maybe that's it. But particles moving at relativistic speeds have their lifetimes dilated. The mean decay distance would be the speed of the particle times the dilated lifetime. The ρ⁰ has energy E = 5 GeV. Its mass is given as 769 MeV, which is 0.769 GeV. So the Lorentz factor γ is E / m = 5 / 0.769 ≈ 6.502. The mean proper lifetime is τ, so the dilated lifetime is γτ. Then the mean decay distance is v * γτ. Assuming the particle is moving at a speed close to c (since it's relativistic), v ≈ c. So the mean decay distance is c * γτ. Let's compute that. c is approximately 3×10^8 m/s. But τ is 4.27×10^-24 s. So:\n\nDistance = c * γ * τ = 3×10^8 m/s * 6.502 * 4.27×10^-24 s ≈ 3×10^8 * 6.502 * 4.27e-24 ≈ Let's compute the exponent: 10^8 * 10^-24 = 10^-16. Then 3 * 6.502 ≈ 19.506, 19.506 * 4.27 ≈ 83.3. So 83.3×10^-16 meters. Wait, that's 8.33×10^-15 meters. That seems way too small. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in units. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 3×10^8 m/s is 3e8 m/s. Multiply by 6.502 (γ) gives 1.9506e9 m/s. Then multiply by τ (4.27e-24 s): 1.9506e9 * 4.27e-24 = (1.9506 * 4.27) * 10^(9-24) = approx 8.33 * 10^-15 meters. That's 8.33 femtometers. But that's extremely short, even for a particle lifetime. But ρ mesons do have very short lifetimes, so maybe that's correct. However, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me verify the steps again.\n\nFirst, Γ is 154 MeV. Convert to GeV: 0.154 GeV. Then τ = ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So 6.582e-25 / 0.154 ≈ 4.27e-24 seconds. That's correct. Then γ is E/m = 5 / 0.769 ≈ 6.502. Then βγ = γ * β. But since the energy is 5 GeV and the mass is 0.769 GeV, the momentum is sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(25 - 0.591) ≈ sqrt(24.409) ≈ 4.94 GeV/c. Then βγ = p / m = 4.94 / 0.769 ≈ 6.424. Alternatively, β = p / E = 4.94 / 5 ≈ 0.988. So γ = E / m = 5 / 0.769 ≈ 6.502. So βγ ≈ 6.502 * 0.988 ≈ 6.424. But for the mean path length, it's c * τ * βγ. Wait, maybe I should use βγ instead of γ. Because the mean decay length is typically calculated as c * τ * βγ. Let me check that formula. Yes, the mean path length is L = c * τ * γ * β. Alternatively, since τ is the proper lifetime, the lab frame lifetime is γτ, and the distance is v * γτ = β c γ τ. So L = β c γ τ. So β is approximately 0.988, so L ≈ 0.988 * 3e8 m/s * 6.502 * 4.27e-24 s. Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 0.988 * 3e8 ≈ 2.964e8 m/s. Then multiply by 6.502: 2.964e8 * 6.502 ≈ 1.927e9 m/s. Then multiply by 4.27e-24 s: 1.927e9 * 4.27e-24 ≈ 8.23e-15 meters, which is 8.23 femtometers. That's still extremely small. But maybe that's correct? Wait, but in reality, particles with such short lifetimes don't travel measurable distances. However, the problem states \"mean decay distance\", which is a theoretical value regardless of practicality. So maybe the answer is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the width given to find the lifetime, then multiply by speed and gamma. So the answer would be τ ≈ 4.27e-24 s and L ≈ 8.2e-15 m. But maybe the units should be converted to more appropriate ones. 8.2e-15 meters is 8.2 femtometers, which is about the size of a nucleus. So yes, the ρ meson decays almost immediately after production, so the decay distance is negligible. So part (a) answers: lifetime ≈ 4.27e-24 s, mean decay distance ≈ 8.2e-15 m. But let me check the calculation once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of β. Let's compute β more accurately. β = v/c = pc/E. The momentum p is sqrt(E² - m²)/c. Wait, in natural units where c=1, p = sqrt(E² - m²). So for E=5 GeV, m=0.769 GeV, p = sqrt(25 - 0.769²) ≈ sqrt(25 - 0.591) ≈ sqrt(24.409) ≈ 4.94 GeV/c. Then β = p c / E. Wait, but in natural units, β = p/E. Since p is in GeV/c and E is in GeV, β = (4.94 GeV/c) / (5 GeV) ) * c = (4.94 / 5) * c. Wait, no, in natural units (c=1), β = p/E. So β = 4.94 / 5 ≈ 0.988. So velocity is 0.988c. Then γ = E/m = 5 / 0.769 ≈ 6.502. So the mean lifetime in lab frame is γτ = 6.502 * 4.27e-24 ≈ 2.78e-23 seconds. Then the decay distance is β c γ τ = 0.988 * 3e8 m/s * 2.78e-23 s ≈ 0.988 * 3e8 * 2.78e-23 ≈ 0.988 * 8.34e-15 ≈ 8.24e-15 meters. So yes, same result. So part (a) answers are τ ≈ 4.27e-24 s and L ≈ 8.2e-15 m. But maybe the problem expects the answer in different units? For example, femtometers or something else. But 8.2e-15 meters is 8.2 femtometers. Alternatively, maybe centimeters? Let's see: 8.2e-15 meters is 8.2e-13 cm. But that's still extremely small. So the answer is correct.\n\nMoving to part (b): What is the π⁻ threshold energy for producing ρ⁰ mesons? The reaction is π⁻ + p → ρ⁰ + n. The threshold energy is the minimum kinetic energy of the pion in the lab frame (where the proton is at rest) needed for the reaction to occur. The threshold condition is when the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products. So the minimum energy occurs when the produced particles (ρ⁰ and neutron) are at rest in the CM frame. The formula for the threshold energy can be calculated using the invariant s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. At threshold, s = (m_ρ + m_n)^2 c^4. The initial s is (E_π + m_p c²)^2 - (p_π c)^2. Setting these equal:\n\n(E_π + m_p c²)^2 - (p_π c)^2 = (m_ρ + m_n)^2 c^4.\n\nBut since E_π² = (p_π c)^2 + (m_π c²)^2, we can substitute (p_π c)^2 = E_π² - (m_π c²)^2 into the equation:\n\n(E_π + m_p c²)^2 - (E_π² - m_π² c^4) = (m_ρ + m_n)^2 c^4.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nE_π² + 2 E_π m_p c² + m_p² c^4 - E_π² + m_π² c^4 = 2 E_π m_p c² + (m_p² + m_π²) c^4.\n\nSet equal to right side:\n\n2 E_π m_p c² + (m_p² + m_π²) c^4 = (m_ρ + m_n)^2 c^4.\n\nSolving for E_π:\n\n2 E_π m_p = (m_ρ + m_n)^2 - m_p² - m_π².\n\nThus,\n\nE_π = [ (m_ρ + m_n)^2 - m_p² - m_π² ] / (2 m_p).\n\nAll masses here are in energy units (like MeV). Let's plug in the values. The masses are:\n\nm_ρ = 769 MeV (given),\n\nm_n (neutron) ≈ 939.57 MeV,\n\nm_p (proton) ≈ 938.27 MeV,\n\nm_π⁻ ≈ 139.57 MeV.\n\nSo compute (m_ρ + m_n)^2 = (769 + 939.57)^2 = (1708.57)^2 ≈ 2,919,200 MeV²,\n\nm_p² = 938.27² ≈ 880,400 MeV²,\n\nm_π² = 139.57² ≈ 19,480 MeV².\n\nSo numerator: 2,919,200 - 880,400 - 19,480 ≈ 2,919,200 - 899,880 ≈ 2,019,320 MeV².\n\nDenominator: 2 * 938.27 ≈ 1,876.54 MeV.\n\nThus, E_π ≈ 2,019,320 / 1,876.54 ≈ 1,076 MeV. So the threshold energy is approximately 1076 MeV. But wait, the question asks for the π⁻ threshold energy. The threshold energy in the lab frame is the minimum kinetic energy of the pion. But wait, the total energy of the pion is E_π = K_π + m_π c². So the kinetic energy K_π = E_π - m_π c² ≈ 1076 - 139.57 ≈ 936.4 MeV. So the threshold kinetic energy is approximately 936 MeV. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, let's compute (m_ρ + m_n) = 769 + 939.57 = 1708.57 MeV. Squared is 1708.57². Let me compute that more accurately. 1700² = 2,890,000. 8.57² ≈ 73.44. Then cross term 2*1700*8.57 = 29,138. So total is 2,890,000 + 29,138 + 73.44 ≈ 2,919,211.44 MeV². Then subtract m_p² (938.27²). Let's compute 938.27²: 900² = 810,000, 38.27² ≈ 1,464.5, cross term 2*900*38.27 = 68,886. So 810,000 + 68,886 + 1,464.5 ≈ 880,350.5 MeV². Then subtract m_p² (880,350.5) and m_π² (19,480). So 2,919,211.44 - 880,350.5 - 19,480 ≈ 2,919,211.44 - 899,830.5 ≈ 2,019,380.94 MeV². Divide by 2 m_p (2*938.27 = 1,876.54 MeV):\n\nE_π = 2,019,380.94 / 1,876.54 ≈ let's compute 2,019,380.94 ÷ 1,876.54. Let's approximate:\n\n1,876.54 * 1,076 ≈ 1,876.54 * 1,000 = 1,876,540\n\n1,876.54 * 76 ≈ 1,876.54 *70=131,357.8; 1,876.54*6=11,259.24 → total 142,617.04\n\nTotal ≈ 1,876,540 + 142,617.04 ≈ 2,019,157.04. That's very close to the numerator 2,019,380.94. So E_π ≈ 1,076 MeV. Then the kinetic energy is E_π - m_π = 1076 - 139.57 ≈ 936.43 MeV. So the threshold kinetic energy is approximately 936 MeV. So part (b) answer is approximately 936 MeV. But let me check if there's a more precise calculation. Alternatively, maybe the answer is expected in GeV? 936 MeV is 0.936 GeV. But the problem might want the answer in GeV. Let me check the given masses. The ρ mass is given as 769 MeV, which is 0.769 GeV. The neutron and proton masses are approximately 939 MeV, so 0.939 GeV. The pion is 139.57 MeV, 0.13957 GeV. So using GeV:\n\nm_ρ = 0.769 GeV,\n\nm_n = 0.93957 GeV,\n\nm_p = 0.93827 GeV,\n\nm_π = 0.13957 GeV.\n\nCompute (m_ρ + m_n) = 0.769 + 0.93957 = 1.70857 GeV. Squared: (1.70857)^2 ≈ 2.9192 GeV².\n\nm_p² = (0.93827)^2 ≈ 0.88035 GeV²,\n\nm_π² = (0.13957)^2 ≈ 0.01948 GeV².\n\nNumerator: 2.9192 - 0.88035 - 0.01948 ≈ 2.9192 - 0.89983 ≈ 2.01937 GeV².\n\nDenominator: 2 * 0.93827 ≈ 1.87654 GeV.\n\nE_π = 2.01937 / 1.87654 ≈ 1.076 GeV. Then K_π = 1.076 - 0.13957 ≈ 0.9364 GeV. So 0.936 GeV, which is 936 MeV. So the answer is approximately 936 MeV. So part (b) answer is 936 MeV.\n\nPart (c): If the production cross section is 1 mb (1e-27 cm²) and the target is 30 cm long liquid hydrogen (density 0.07 g/cm³), how many ρ⁰ are produced per incident π⁻? The formula for the number of reactions is N = σ * n * x, where σ is cross section, n is number density of targets, x is length. But since it's liquid hydrogen, the target is protons (assuming liquid hydrogen is H₂ molecules, so two protons per molecule). The density is 0.07 g/cm³. Let's compute the number density. The molar mass of H₂ is 2*1.008 g/mol ≈ 2.016 g/mol. Number of moles per cm³ is density / molar mass = 0.07 g/cm³ / 2.016 g/mol ≈ 0.0347 mol/cm³. Then number of molecules per cm³ is 0.0347 * Avogadro's number (6.022e23) ≈ 0.0347 * 6.022e23 ≈ 2.09e22 molecules/cm³. Each H₂ molecule has 2 protons, so number of protons per cm³ is 2 * 2.09e22 ≈ 4.18e22 cm⁻³. The target length is 30 cm, so the column density (number per cm²) is n * x = 4.18e22 cm⁻³ * 30 cm = 1.254e24 cm⁻². Then the probability (number of reactions per incident pion) is σ * n * x = 1e-27 cm² * 1.254e24 cm⁻² = 1.254e-3. So approximately 0.001254 ρ⁰ per pion. So about 1.25e-3. So the answer is approximately 1.25×10^-3. Let me check the steps again.\n\nDensity of liquid hydrogen is 0.07 g/cm³. Since it's H₂, each molecule has 2 protons. Molar mass of H₂ is 2 g/mol (approx, more precisely 2.016). Number of moles per cm³: 0.07 g/cm³ / 2.016 g/mol ≈ 0.0347 mol/cm³. Number of molecules: 0.0347 * 6.022e23 ≈ 2.09e22 molecules/cm³. Each molecule has 2 protons, so 4.18e22 protons/cm³. Then n = 4.18e22 cm⁻³. Length x = 30 cm. Column density n x = 4.18e22 * 30 = 1.254e24 cm⁻². Cross section σ = 1e-27 cm². Then N = σ * n x = 1e-27 * 1.254e24 = 1.254e-3. So approximately 0.00125 or 1.25×10^-3. So part (c) answer is 1.25×10^-3.\n\nPart (d): ρ⁰ decays into π⁺ + π⁻. Given that the ρ⁰ is produced in the forward direction in the lab frame with energy 5 GeV, what is the minimum opening angle between the two pions in the lab frame? The minimum opening angle occurs when the two pions are emitted in opposite directions in the ρ⁰ rest frame, leading to the smallest possible angle in the lab frame due to Lorentz boosting. Let's consider the decay in the rest frame of the ρ⁰. The two pions are emitted back-to-back with equal and opposite momenta. When boosted to the lab frame (where the ρ⁰ is moving with high energy), the pions will be focused in the forward direction, but the minimum angle between them occurs when they are emitted symmetrically in the rest frame. The minimum angle can be found using relativistic kinematics. The idea is that in the rest frame, the pions are emitted at 180° apart. After boosting to the lab frame, their directions are altered, but the minimum angle is determined by the maximum collimation. The angle can be calculated using the Lorentz transformation of angles. Alternatively, using the formula for the opening angle in a two-body decay. The minimum opening angle θ_min satisfies:\n\ncosθ_min = ( (γ² - 1) - ( (m_ρ/(2m_π))² -1 ) ) / ( (γ² -1 ) + ( (m_ρ/(2m_π))² -1 ) )\n\nBut I might be misremembering the exact formula. Alternatively, consider that in the rest frame, each pion has energy E' = m_ρ/2 ≈ 769/2 ≈ 384.5 MeV. Their momentum p' = sqrt(E'^2 - m_π^2) ≈ sqrt(384.5² - 139.57²) ≈ sqrt(147,840 - 19,480) ≈ sqrt(128,360) ≈ 358.3 MeV/c. The direction of emission in the rest frame is isotropic, but the minimum angle in the lab occurs when the pions are emitted opposite to the boost direction (i.e., one in the same direction as the boost and the other opposite). Wait, no. If the ρ is moving along the z-axis in the lab frame, then in the rest frame, the pions are emitted in some direction. When boosted, their directions in the lab frame depend on their emission angles in the rest frame. The minimum opening angle occurs when both pions are emitted in the transverse direction (perpendicular to the boost), but due to the boost, their directions are slightly altered. Wait, perhaps another approach. The minimum opening angle occurs when the two pions are emitted symmetrically with respect to the boost direction in the rest frame. Let's denote that in the rest frame, one pion is emitted at angle θ' and the other at π - θ'. After the boost, their angles in the lab frame will be θ1 and θ2. The opening angle is θ1 + θ2. To find the minimum, we need to find the configuration where θ1 + θ2 is minimized. This likely occurs when the pions are emitted in the direction of the boost and opposite. Let me think. Suppose in the rest frame, one pion is emitted forward (along the boost direction) and the other backward. After boosting, the forward pion will have a larger energy and a smaller angle (more collimated), while the backward pion might be boosted forward but with a larger angle. Wait, but if the boost is very high (γ is large), even the backward pion in the rest frame might be moving forward in the lab frame. Wait, the ρ⁰ has energy 5 GeV, which is much larger than its rest mass (0.769 GeV), so γ = 5 / 0.769 ≈ 6.5. So the boost is significant but not ultra-relativistic. Let's compute the velocities. The βγ of the ρ⁰ is p/m = sqrt(E² - m²)/m = sqrt(25 - 0.591)/0.769 ≈ sqrt(24.409)/0.769 ≈ 4.94 / 0.769 ≈ 6.424. So β = p/E = 4.94 / 5 ≈ 0.988. So β ≈ 0.988, γ ≈ 6.5. Now, in the rest frame of the ρ⁰, each pion has momentum p' ≈ 358.3 MeV/c as calculated earlier. Let's take the case where one pion is emitted along the boost direction (θ' = 0) and the other opposite (θ' = π). For the forward pion (θ' = 0), its lab frame momentum is transformed via Lorentz boost. The Lorentz transformation for momentum in the direction of the boost (z-direction) is:\n\np_z = γ (p'_z + β E')\n\nE = γ (E' + β p'_z)\n\nFor the forward pion: p'_z = p' = 358.3 MeV/c, E' = 384.5 MeV.\n\nSo p_z = γ (358.3 + β * 384.5) = 6.5 * (358.3 + 0.988 * 384.5). Compute β * 384.5 ≈ 0.988 * 384.5 ≈ 379.5 MeV/c. So 358.3 + 379.5 ≈ 737.8 MeV/c. Then p_z ≈ 6.5 * 737.8 ≈ 4,795.7 MeV/c ≈ 4.796 GeV/c. The transverse momentum p_T is zero (since it's along the boost direction). The energy E = γ (384.5 + 0.988 * 358.3) ≈ 6.5 * (384.5 + 354.0) ≈ 6.5 * 738.5 ≈ 4,800 MeV ≈ 4.8 GeV. So this pion is moving almost in the forward direction with very high energy.\n\nFor the backward pion (θ' = π), p'_z = -358.3 MeV/c, E' = 384.5 MeV.\n\nThen p_z = γ (-358.3 + β * 384.5) = 6.5 * (-358.3 + 379.5) ≈ 6.5 * 21.2 ≈ 137.8 MeV/c ≈ 0.1378 GeV/c. The transverse momentum is still zero. The energy E = γ (384.5 + β*(-358.3)) ≈ 6.5*(384.5 - 354.0) ≈ 6.5*30.5 ≈ 198.25 MeV ≈ 0.198 GeV. So this pion has much lower energy and is moving forward but with a small momentum. The angle θ for this pion in the lab frame can be found using tanθ = p_T / p_z. But since p_T is zero for both, they are along the same line. Wait, but in this case, both pions are along the same line (the boost direction), so the opening angle is zero? That can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, if one pion is emitted forward and the other backward in the ρ⁰ rest frame, after the boost, the backward pion might actually be moving forward in the lab frame but with a smaller momentum. So both pions are moving in the same direction, leading to an opening angle of zero. But that contradicts the idea of a minimum opening angle. Wait, perhaps the minimum opening angle occurs when the pions are emitted perpendicular to the boost direction in the rest frame. Let's consider that case. Suppose in the rest frame, the pions are emitted at θ' = 90°, perpendicular to the boost direction. Then their momenta have p'_z = 0, and p'_T = 358.3 MeV/c. After the boost, their lab frame momenta will have p_z = γ (0 + β E'), and p_T = p'_T. The energy E = γ (E' + β * 0) = γ E'. So for each pion, p_z = γ β E', p_T = p'_T. The angle in the lab frame is given by tanθ = p_T / p_z. So θ = arctan(p'_T / (γ β E')). Let's compute this. p'_T = 358.3 MeV/c, γ = 6.5, β = 0.988, E' = 384.5 MeV. So p_z = 6.5 * 0.988 * 384.5 ≈ 6.5 * 0.988 ≈ 6.422 * 384.5 ≈ 2,470 MeV/c ≈ 2.47 GeV/c. p_T = 358.3 MeV/c. So tanθ ≈ 358.3 / 2470 ≈ 0.145. So θ ≈ arctan(0.145) ≈ 8.25°. Since both pions are emitted in opposite transverse directions (say, +y and -y), their angles in the lab frame would be ±8.25° from the boost direction. Thus, the opening angle between them is 2*8.25 ≈ 16.5°. This would be the minimum opening angle because any other emission angle in the rest frame would lead to a larger angle in the lab. For example, if the pions are emitted at some other angle, their lab frame angles would be more spread out. Therefore, the minimum opening angle is approximately 16.5 degrees. Let me verify this calculation.\n\nCompute p_z for each pion in the lab frame when emitted at 90° in the rest frame:\n\np_z = γ β E' = 6.5 * 0.988 * 384.5 ≈ 6.5 * 0.988 ≈ 6.422; 6.422 * 384.5 ≈ 6.422 * 300 = 1,926.6; 6.422 * 84.5 ≈ 542.3; total ≈ 2,468.9 MeV/c.\n\np_T = 358.3 MeV/c.\n\ntanθ = 358.3 / 2468.9 ≈ 0.145 → θ ≈ 8.25°. So each pion is at 8.25° from the beam axis, but in opposite transverse directions. Thus, the angle between them is 2*8.25° = 16.5°. So the minimum opening angle is 16.5 degrees. But let's check if there's a configuration where the opening angle is smaller. Suppose the pions are emitted at some angle in the rest frame such that their lab frame angles are closer. For example, if one pion is emitted forward and the other at some angle. But in that case, the forward pion would be very collimated, and the other would have a larger angle. Alternatively, if both are emitted at some angle in the rest frame, their lab frame angles might be closer. However, the minimum opening angle occurs when the pions are emitted perpendicular to the boost direction in the rest frame, leading to symmetric angles in the lab frame. Therefore, the minimum opening angle is 2θ, where θ is the angle of each pion from the beam axis, which is 8.25°, so total 16.5°. Let me compute this more accurately.\n\nCompute tanθ = p_T / p_z = (358.3 MeV/c) / (6.5 * 0.988 * 384.5 MeV/c). Let's compute denominator: 6.5 * 0.988 = 6.422. 6.422 * 384.5 = 6.422 * 300 = 1926.6, 6.422 * 84.5 = 6.422 * 80 = 513.76, 6.422 * 4.5 = 28.899. Total 1926.6 + 513.76 + 28.899 ≈ 2469.259 MeV/c. So tanθ = 358.3 / 2469.259 ≈ 0.1451. θ ≈ arctan(0.1451) ≈ 8.26°. So opening angle is 2*8.26 ≈ 16.52°, which rounds to approximately 16.5 degrees. Converting to radians if needed, but the answer is in degrees. So the minimum opening angle is about 16.5 degrees. But let me check if there's a formula that relates the opening angle directly. The minimum opening angle can be found using:\n\nθ_min = 2 * arctan( m_ρ / (2 γ m_π ) )\n\nWait, let's see. In the rest frame, the transverse momentum p'_T is limited by the decay kinematics. The maximum transverse momentum in the lab frame is p_T = p'_T, and the longitudinal momentum is γ (p'_z + β E'). For p'_z = 0 (emitted perpendicular), p_z = γ β E'. The angle is tanθ = p_T / p_z = p'_T / (γ β E'). But in the rest frame, E' = sqrt(p'^2 + m_π^2). For the decay, p' = sqrt( (m_ρ/2)^2 - m_π^2 ). So p' = sqrt( (769/2)^2 - 139.57^2 ) ≈ sqrt(147,840 - 19,480) ≈ sqrt(128,360) ≈ 358.3 MeV/c. So p'_T = 358.3 MeV/c. Then tanθ = 358.3 / (γ β E'). E' = m_ρ/2 = 769/2 = 384.5 MeV. So tanθ = 358.3 / (6.5 * 0.988 * 384.5) ≈ 358.3 / (6.422 * 384.5) ≈ 358.3 / 2469.2 ≈ 0.1451. So θ ≈ 8.26°, as before. Thus, the minimum opening angle is 2θ ≈ 16.5°. So the answer is approximately 16.5 degrees. But let me check with exact values. Alternatively, using the formula:\n\nθ_min = 2 * arcsin( m_ρ / (2 γ m_π ) )\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. The transverse momentum in the lab frame is p_T = p'_T. The longitudinal momentum is p_z = γ (p'_z + β E'). For maximum transverse momentum, p'_z = 0, so p_z = γ β E'. The angle is given by tanθ = p_T / p_z = (p'_T) / (γ β E'). But p'_T = p' = sqrt( (m_ρ/2)^2 - m_π^2 ). So tanθ = sqrt( (m_ρ/2)^2 - m_π^2 ) / (γ β (m_ρ/2) ). Let's compute this:\n\nsqrt( (769/2)^2 - 139.57^2 ) / (γ β (769/2) )\n\n= 358.3 / (6.5 * 0.988 * 384.5 )\n\nAs before, which gives tanθ ≈ 0.1451, θ ≈ 8.26°, so opening angle ≈ 16.5°. Therefore, the minimum opening angle is approximately 16.5 degrees. Converting to radians if necessary, but the problem asks for the angle in the lab frame, likely in degrees. So the answer is approximately 16.5 degrees. But let me check with exact numbers. Let's compute more precisely:\n\nm_ρ = 769 MeV,\n\nm_π = 139.57 MeV,\n\nγ = 5 / 0.769 ≈ 6.502,\n\nβ = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/(6.502²)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/42.27) ≈ sqrt(0.9763) ≈ 0.9881.\n\np' = sqrt( (769/2)^2 - 139.57^2 ) = sqrt(384.5² - 139.57²) = sqrt(147,840.25 - 19,479.8) = sqrt(128,360.45) ≈ 358.3 MeV/c.\n\ntanθ = 358.3 / (6.502 * 0.9881 * 384.5) ≈ 358.3 / (6.502 * 0.9881 * 384.5)\n\nFirst compute denominator:\n\n6.502 * 0.9881 ≈ 6.502 * 0.988 ≈ 6.502 - 6.502*0.012 ≈ 6.502 - 0.078 ≈ 6.424.\n\n6.424 * 384.5 ≈ 6 * 384.5 + 0.424 * 384.5 ≈ 2,307 + 163.3 ≈ 2,470.3 MeV/c.\n\nSo tanθ ≈ 358.3 / 2470.3 ≈ 0.1451 → θ ≈ 8.26°, so opening angle ≈ 16.5°. Therefore, the answer is approximately 16.5 degrees. The problem might expect an exact expression or a more precise value. Let's compute tanθ more accurately:\n\n358.3 / 2470.3 = 0.14506. arctan(0.14506) ≈ 8.255°, so opening angle ≈ 16.51°, which rounds to 16.5°. So the answer is approximately 16.5 degrees. Therefore, part (d) answer is 16.5 degrees, which in boxed form is \\boxed{16.5^\\circ}.\n</think>\n\n(a) The lifetime of the ρ⁰ meson is calculated using the uncertainty principle:  \n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{GeV·s}}{0.154 \\, \\text{GeV}} \\approx 4.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}.\n\\]\nThe mean decay distance is obtained using relativistic time dilation:  \n\\[\nL = \\beta \\gamma c \\tau = 0.988 \\times 6.502 \\times 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 4.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s} \\approx 8.2 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}.\n\\]\n**Answer:**  \nLifetime: \\(\\boxed{4.3 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}}\\), Mean decay distance: \\(\\boxed", "final_answers": ["16.5^\\circ", "4.3 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "16.5^\\circ", "expr2": "\\tau = 2.78 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{s}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "16.5^\\circ", "expr2": "d = 8.23 \\times 10^{-13} \\, \\text{cm}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "16.5^\\circ", "expr2": "E_{\\pi} = 1077 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "16.5^\\circ", "expr2": "N = 1.3 \\times 10^{-3}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "16.5**circ", "expr2": "0.00130000000000000"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "16.5^\\circ", "expr2": "0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "16.5**circ", "expr2": "0"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "4.3 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}", "expr2": "\\tau = 2.78 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{s}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "4.3 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}", "expr2": "d = 8.23 \\times 10^{-13} \\, \\text{cm}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "4.3 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}", "expr2": "E_{\\pi} = 1077 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "4.3 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}", "expr2": "N = 1.3 \\times 10^{-3}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "4.3 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{s}", "expr2": "0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/4-37", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this Compton scattering problem where photons are colliding head-on with moving electrons. The question is asking for the energy of the back-scattered photons when the scattering angle is 180 degrees. The incident photons have an energy of 2 eV, and the electrons have a kinetic energy of 1 GeV. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about Compton scattering.\n\nFirst, the standard Compton scattering formula relates the wavelength shift of the photon after scattering to the scattering angle. The formula is usually given as:\n\nΔλ = λ' - λ = (h/(m_e c)) (1 - cosθ)\n\nHere, λ is the initial wavelength, λ' is the scattered wavelength, h is Planck's constant, m_e is the electron mass, c is the speed of light, and θ is the scattering angle. But in this case, the electrons are moving, and they have a significant kinetic energy (1 GeV), which is much larger than the photon's energy (2 eV). So the usual formula might not apply directly because the electron isn't at rest. I need to consider the relativistic effects here.\n\nWait, when the electron is moving, especially at high energies, the collision is more complex. Since the electrons are moving towards the photons (head-on collision), their energies will add in some way. Maybe I should use the relativistic Doppler shift or consider the frame of reference where the electron is at rest. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the conservation of energy and momentum in the lab frame. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet's denote the following variables:\n\n- The energy of the incident photon: E_γ = 2 eV\n- The kinetic energy of the electron: K = 1 GeV\n- The rest mass energy of the electron: m_e c² ≈ 0.511 MeV\n- The total energy of the electron: E_e = K + m_e c² = 1 GeV + 0.511 MeV ≈ 1.000511 GeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, so 0.511 MeV is negligible compared to 1 GeV, but maybe I should keep it for precision)\n- The momentum of the electron: p_e. Since the electron is moving at high energy, its momentum can be approximated relativistically. For relativistic electrons, E_e ≈ pc, so p_e ≈ E_e / c. But actually, the exact relation is E_e² = (pc)² + (m_e c²)². So p_e = sqrt(E_e² - (m_e c²)^2) / c. But since E_e is much larger than m_e c² (1 GeV vs 0.511 MeV), we can approximate p_e ≈ E_e / c. Let me check:\n\nE_e = 1.000511 GeV ≈ 1000.511 MeV. Then,\n\np_e c = sqrt(E_e² - (m_e c²)^2) = sqrt((1000.511)^2 - (0.511)^2) ≈ sqrt(1001,022.256 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(1001,022) ≈ 1000.511 MeV. So p_e ≈ 1000.511 MeV / c. So approximately, p_e ≈ E_e / c. So maybe we can take p_e ≈ E_e / c. But let's keep in mind that E_e is the total energy.\n\nNow, the photon is moving in the opposite direction to the electron (head-on collision). Let's define the direction of the electron's motion as the positive direction. Then the photon is moving in the negative direction. So their momenta are opposite.\n\nIn the lab frame, the initial momentum of the photon is p_γ = E_γ / c (since for photons, E = pc). But since it's moving in the opposite direction, its momentum is -E_γ / c.\n\nThe electron's momentum is p_e ≈ E_e / c (as above).\n\nAfter the collision, the photon is back-scattered, meaning it's moving in the positive direction (θ = 180 degrees relative to its initial direction). So its momentum is p'_γ = E'_γ / c in the positive direction.\n\nThe electron's momentum after collision will be p'_e. Let's denote its energy as E'_e.\n\nConservation of momentum:\n\nInitial momentum = Final momentum\n\np_e (electron's initial) + (-p_γ) (photon's initial) = p'_e (electron's final) + p'_γ (photon's final)\n\nSo:\n\np_e - p_γ = p'_e + p'_γ\n\nSimilarly, conservation of energy:\n\nE_e + E_γ = E'_e + E'_γ\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1. p_e - p_γ = p'_e + p'_γ\n2. E_e + E_γ = E'_e + E'_γ\n\nBut we need to relate these. The problem is that E'_e and p'_e are related through the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE'_e² = (p'_e c)^2 + (m_e c²)^2\n\nSo we have three equations here. Let's try to express everything in terms of E'_γ and solve for it.\n\nFirst, let's express all terms in terms of energy divided by c for momentum. Let me write p_γ = E_γ / c, p'_γ = E'_γ / c. Similarly, p_e is approximately E_e / c, but more accurately, p_e = sqrt(E_e² - (m_e c²)^2) / c. But given that E_e is much larger than m_e c², p_e ≈ E_e / c. Let's check the exact value:\n\nE_e = 1 GeV + m_e c² ≈ 1.000511 GeV. So,\n\np_e c = sqrt( (1.000511 GeV)^2 - (0.511 MeV)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( (1000.511 MeV)^2 - (0.511 MeV)^2 ) ≈ 1000.511 MeV (since the second term is negligible). So p_e ≈ 1000.511 MeV / c ≈ 1.000511 GeV / c. So for practical purposes, p_e ≈ E_e / c. So we can approximate p_e ≈ E_e / c.\n\nTherefore, the momentum conservation equation becomes:\n\n(E_e / c) - (E_γ / c) = p'_e + (E'_γ / c)\n\nMultiply both sides by c:\n\nE_e - E_γ = p'_e c + E'_γ\n\nSimilarly, the energy conservation equation is:\n\nE_e + E_γ = E'_e + E'_γ\n\nSo we have:\n\n1. E_e - E_γ = p'_e c + E'_γ\n2. E_e + E_γ = E'_e + E'_γ\n\nFrom equation 2: E_e + E_γ - E'_γ = E'_e\n\nFrom equation 1: p'_e c = E_e - E_γ - E'_γ\n\nBut E'_e² = (p'_e c)^2 + (m_e c²)^2\n\nSo substitute E'_e from equation 2 and p'_e c from equation 1 into this:\n\n(E_e + E_γ - E'_γ)^2 = (E_e - E_γ - E'_γ)^2 + (m_e c²)^2\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: (E_e + E_γ - E'_γ)^2 = [ (E_e + E_γ) - E'_γ ]^2 = (E_e + E_γ)^2 - 2(E_e + E_γ)E'_γ + (E'_γ)^2\n\nRight side: (E_e - E_γ - E'_γ)^2 + (m_e c²)^2 = [ (E_e - E_γ) - E'_γ ]^2 + (m_e c²)^2 = (E_e - E_γ)^2 - 2(E_e - E_γ)E'_γ + (E'_γ)^2 + (m_e c²)^2\n\nSubtract right side from left side:\n\nLeft - Right = [ (E_e + E_γ)^2 - 2(E_e + E_γ)E'_γ + (E'_γ)^2 ] - [ (E_e - E_γ)^2 - 2(E_e - E_γ)E'_γ + (E'_γ)^2 + (m_e c²)^2 ] = 0\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: (E_e + E_γ)^2 - (E_e - E_γ)^2 = [E_e² + 2 E_e E_γ + E_γ²] - [E_e² - 2 E_e E_γ + E_γ²] = 4 E_e E_γ\n\nSecond term: -2(E_e + E_γ)E'_γ - (-2(E_e - E_γ)E'_γ ) = -2(E_e + E_γ)E'_γ + 2(E_e - E_γ)E'_γ = -2E'_γ [ (E_e + E_γ) - (E_e - E_γ) ] = -2E'_γ [2 E_γ] = -4 E_γ E'_γ\n\nThird term: (E'_γ)^2 - (E'_γ)^2 = 0\n\nFourth term: - (m_e c²)^2\n\nSo overall:\n\n4 E_e E_γ - 4 E_γ E'_γ - (m_e c²)^2 = 0\n\nRearranged:\n\n4 E_e E_γ - 4 E_γ E'_γ = (m_e c²)^2\n\nFactor out 4 E_γ (E_e - E'_γ) = (m_e c²)^2\n\nThen:\n\nE_e - E'_γ = (m_e c²)^2 / (4 E_γ)\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nWait, 4 E_γ (E_e - E'_γ) = (m_e c²)^2\n\nSo,\n\nE_e - E'_γ = (m_e c²)^2 / (4 E_γ)\n\nTherefore,\n\nE'_γ = E_e - (m_e c²)^2 / (4 E_γ)\n\nBut wait, this seems a bit strange. Let me check the algebra again.\n\nWait, after expanding and simplifying, we had:\n\n4 E_e E_γ - 4 E_γ E'_γ - (m_e c²)^2 = 0\n\nSo,\n\n4 E_γ (E_e - E'_γ) = (m_e c²)^2\n\nTherefore,\n\nE_e - E'_γ = (m_e c²)^2 / (4 E_γ)\n\nSo,\n\nE'_γ = E_e - (m_e c²)^2 / (4 E_γ)\n\nBut E_e is the total energy of the electron, which is K + m_e c² = 1 GeV + 0.511 MeV. But 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, so E_e ≈ 1000.511 MeV ≈ 1000.5 MeV.\n\nBut let's plug in the numbers. Let's convert all energies to the same units. Let's use MeV.\n\nGiven:\n\nE_γ = 2 eV. 1 eV = 1e-6 MeV, so E_γ = 2e-6 MeV.\n\nm_e c² = 0.511 MeV.\n\nE_e = 1 GeV + m_e c² = 1000 MeV + 0.511 MeV = 1000.511 MeV.\n\nSo,\n\nE'_γ = E_e - (m_e c²)^2 / (4 E_γ)\n\nPlugging in:\n\nE'_γ = 1000.511 MeV - (0.511 MeV)^2 / (4 * 2e-6 MeV)\n\nCompute the second term:\n\n(0.511)^2 = 0.261121 MeV²\n\nDenominator: 4 * 2e-6 MeV = 8e-6 MeV\n\nSo,\n\n0.261121 / 8e-6 = 0.261121 / 0.000008 ≈ 32640.125 MeV\n\nTherefore,\n\nE'_γ ≈ 1000.511 MeV - 32640.125 MeV ≈ -31639.614 MeV\n\nWait, that can't be right. Energy can't be negative. There must be a mistake in the derivation.\n\nHmm, getting a negative energy for the scattered photon? That's impossible. Where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me check the steps again. Starting from the conservation equations:\n\nMomentum conservation:\n\nE_e - E_γ = p'_e c + E'_γ\n\nEnergy conservation:\n\nE_e + E_γ = E'_e + E'_γ\n\nThen, substituting E'_e = E_e + E_γ - E'_γ into the energy-momentum relation:\n\n(E_e + E_γ - E'_γ)^2 = (E_e - E_γ - E'_γ)^2 + (m_e c²)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft: (E_e + E_γ - E'_γ)^2 = E_e² + 2 E_e E_γ - 2 E_e E'_γ + E_γ² - 2 E_γ E'_γ + E'_γ²\n\nRight: (E_e - E_γ - E'_γ)^2 + (m_e c²)^2 = E_e² - 2 E_e E_γ - 2 E_e E'_γ + E_γ² + 2 E_γ E'_γ + E'_γ² + (m_e c²)^2\n\nSubtracting right from left:\n\nLeft - Right = [E_e² + 2 E_e E_γ - 2 E_e E'_γ + E_γ² - 2 E_γ E'_γ + E'_γ²] - [E_e² - 2 E_e E_γ - 2 E_e E'_γ + E_γ² + 2 E_γ E'_γ + E'_γ² + (m_e c²)^2]\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nE_e² cancels.\n\n+2 E_e E_γ - (-2 E_e E_γ) = +4 E_e E_γ\n\n-2 E_e E'_γ - (-2 E_e E'_γ) = 0\n\nE_γ² cancels.\n\n-2 E_γ E'_γ - (+2 E_γ E'_γ) = -4 E_γ E'_γ\n\nE'_γ² cancels.\n\nThen, remaining term: - (m_e c²)^2\n\nSo overall:\n\n4 E_e E_γ - 4 E_γ E'_γ - (m_e c²)^2 = 0\n\nWhich leads to:\n\n4 E_γ (E_e - E'_γ) = (m_e c²)^2\n\nSo,\n\nE_e - E'_γ = (m_e c²)^2 / (4 E_γ)\n\nTherefore,\n\nE'_γ = E_e - (m_e c²)^2 / (4 E_γ)\n\nBut plugging in the numbers gives a negative value, which is impossible. So this suggests that the approach might be incorrect. Maybe because the assumption that the electron is ultra-relativistic (p_e ≈ E_e / c) is causing an error here? Or perhaps the initial setup is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the problem in the center-of-momentum frame and then transform back. Let's try that.\n\nBut first, let's check the units again. The photon energy is 2 eV, which is 2e-6 MeV. The electron's rest mass is 0.511 MeV. The term (m_e c²)^2 / (4 E_γ) is (0.511)^2 / (4 * 2e-6) MeV. Let's compute that:\n\n(0.511)^2 = 0.261121 (MeV)^2\n\nDivide by (4 * 2e-6 MeV) = 8e-6 MeV\n\nSo 0.261121 / 8e-6 = 0.261121 / 0.000008 ≈ 32640.125 MeV ≈ 32.64 GeV\n\nSo (m_e c²)^2 / (4 E_γ) ≈ 32.64 GeV\n\nBut E_e is only 1 GeV (approx 1.000511 GeV). So E'_γ = 1 GeV - 32.64 GeV ≈ -31.64 GeV, which is negative. That's impossible. So clearly, this approach is flawed.\n\nWait, but why? Maybe because the initial assumption that the electron is moving towards the photon with high energy makes the problem such that the photon gains energy, but according to this, the photon's energy becomes negative, which is impossible. So perhaps the mistake is in the sign convention for the momentum conservation.\n\nLet me re-examine the momentum conservation. The electron is moving in the positive direction, the photon is moving in the negative direction. So their initial momenta are:\n\nElectron: p_e = E_e / c (positive)\n\nPhoton: p_γ = E_γ / c (negative, so -E_γ / c in the positive direction)\n\nAfter collision, the photon is back-scattered, so it's moving in the positive direction, so p'_γ = E'_γ / c (positive)\n\nThe electron's momentum after collision is p'_e (positive or negative? Since it's a head-on collision and the photon is back-scattered, the electron might recoil in the negative direction, but in high-energy collisions, maybe it still moves forward. Hmm, but momentum conservation must hold.\n\nWait, if the initial momentum of the electron is much larger than the photon's, then even after collision, the electron's momentum might still be in the positive direction, but reduced. Let's think.\n\nBut according to the initial momentum conservation equation:\n\np_e - p_γ = p'_e + p'_γ\n\nGiven that p_e is about 1000 MeV/c, p_γ is 2e-6 MeV/c (negligible). So approximately:\n\np_e ≈ p'_e + p'_γ\n\nBut if the photon is back-scattered with high energy, p'_γ could be significant. Wait, but in the original derivation, we ended up with a negative energy, which suggests that the assumption that the electron's energy is 1 GeV is not enough to allow such a scattering. But that seems counterintuitive because 1 GeV is much larger than 2 eV.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct approach is to use the inverse Compton scattering formula. When a high-energy electron collides with a low-energy photon, the maximum energy transferred to the photon occurs when the photon is scattered back (θ = 180°). The formula for the maximum photon energy in inverse Compton scattering is:\n\nE'_γ ≈ (4 γ² E_γ) / (1 + 4 γ E_γ / (m_e c²))\n\nWhere γ is the Lorentz factor of the electron. But wait, I need to recall the correct formula.\n\nAlternatively, in the electron's rest frame, the photon is blueshifted due to the relativistic motion. Then, the Compton scattering occurs, and when transformed back to the lab frame, the photon's energy is further increased.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nFirst, compute the Lorentz factor γ of the electron. The electron's kinetic energy K = (γ - 1) m_e c². Given K = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, and m_e c² = 0.511 MeV, so:\n\nγ = 1 + K / (m_e c²) = 1 + 1000 / 0.511 ≈ 1 + 1956.95 ≈ 1957.95\n\nSo γ ≈ 1958.\n\nThe velocity β of the electron is given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), so β ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) ≈ 1 - 1/(2 γ²) for large γ. But maybe we can approximate β ≈ 1.\n\nNow, in the electron's rest frame, the photon's energy is blueshifted. The Doppler shift factor for a head-on collision is:\n\nD = (1 + β) / sqrt(1 - β²) ≈ (1 + 1) / (1/γ) ) = 2 γ\n\nWait, the Doppler shift when the source is moving towards the observer (which is the case here, since the electron is moving towards the photon) is given by:\n\nD = sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) )\n\nBut since β ≈ 1, let's compute it properly.\n\nThe Doppler factor for a photon coming from the opposite direction (head-on) is:\n\nD = (1 + β) / sqrt(1 - β²) ) = (1 + β) / sqrt( (1 - β)(1 + β) )) = sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )\n\nBut since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt( (1 - β)(1 + β) ) )\n\nFor large γ, β ≈ 1 - 1/(2 γ²), but maybe it's easier to use the relation that for large γ, D ≈ 2 γ.\n\nYes, because when β ≈ 1, sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) ≈ sqrt( 2 / (1 - β) ) ≈ sqrt( 2 γ² ) = γ sqrt(2). Wait, maybe not. Let's see:\n\nWait, if γ is large, then β ≈ 1 - 1/(2 γ²). Then,\n\n(1 + β) ≈ 2 - 1/(2 γ²)\n\n(1 - β) ≈ 1/(2 γ²)\n\nSo,\n\nD = sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) ≈ sqrt( (2) / (1/(2 γ²)) ) = sqrt(4 γ²) = 2 γ\n\nTherefore, the Doppler shift factor D ≈ 2 γ.\n\nTherefore, in the electron's rest frame, the photon's energy is:\n\nE'_γ,rest = D * E_γ ≈ 2 γ E_γ\n\nAfter scattering at 180 degrees in the electron's rest frame (which corresponds to back-scattering in the lab frame), the photon's energy remains the same in the rest frame (since Compton scattering in the rest frame for θ = 180° would just reverse the direction, but the energy depends on the angle). Wait, no. Wait, in the electron's rest frame, the photon comes in with energy E'_γ,rest, scatters at angle θ', and the energy after scattering is given by the Compton formula:\n\nE''_γ,rest = E'_γ,rest / (1 + (E'_γ,rest / (m_e c²)) (1 - cosθ'))\n\nIn this case, if the photon is back-scattered in the lab frame, which corresponds to θ' = 180° in the electron's rest frame. So cosθ' = -1.\n\nTherefore,\n\nE''_γ,rest = E'_γ,rest / (1 + (E'_γ,rest / (m_e c²)) (1 - (-1)) )\n\n= E'_γ,rest / (1 + 2 E'_γ,rest / (m_e c²) )\n\nBut E'_γ,rest = 2 γ E_γ (from Doppler shift)\n\nSo,\n\nE''_γ,rest = (2 γ E_γ) / (1 + 2 * 2 γ E_γ / (m_e c²) )\n\n= (2 γ E_γ) / (1 + (4 γ E_γ) / (m_e c²) )\n\nNow, transforming back to the lab frame, the photon's energy is again Doppler shifted. Since after scattering, the photon is moving in the direction of the electron's motion (back-scattered in the lab frame), the Doppler shift factor when going from the electron's rest frame to the lab frame is again D ≈ 2 γ.\n\nTherefore, the final photon energy in the lab frame is:\n\nE'_γ,lab = D * E''_γ,rest ≈ 2 γ * [ (2 γ E_γ) / (1 + (4 γ E_γ)/(m_e c²) ) ]\n\n= (4 γ² E_γ) / (1 + (4 γ E_γ)/(m_e c²) )\n\nThis is the standard formula for the maximum energy in inverse Compton scattering:\n\nE'_γ,max ≈ (4 γ² E_γ) / (1 + 4 γ E_γ / (m_e c²))\n\nLet's compute this.\n\nFirst, compute 4 γ E_γ / (m_e c²)\n\nGiven:\n\nγ ≈ 1958\n\nE_γ = 2 eV\n\nm_e c² = 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV\n\nSo,\n\n4 γ E_γ / (m_e c²) = (4 * 1958 * 2 eV) / (511,000 eV) ≈ (15,664 eV) / (511,000 eV) ≈ 0.03065\n\nSo the denominator is 1 + 0.03065 ≈ 1.03065\n\nThen,\n\nE'_γ,max ≈ (4 γ² E_γ) / 1.03065\n\nCompute 4 γ² E_γ:\n\n4 * (1958)^2 * 2 eV\n\nFirst, 1958^2 ≈ (2000 - 42)^2 ≈ 2000² - 2*2000*42 + 42² ≈ 4,000,000 - 168,000 + 1,764 ≈ 3,833,764\n\nThen, 4 * 3,833,764 ≈ 15,335,056\n\nMultiply by 2 eV: 15,335,056 * 2 ≈ 30,670,112 eV ≈ 30.67 MeV\n\nDivide by 1.03065: 30.67 MeV / 1.03065 ≈ 29.75 MeV\n\nSo approximately 30 MeV.\n\nWait, but let's compute it more accurately.\n\nFirst, compute γ:\n\nK = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV\n\nγ = (K + m_e c²)/ (m_e c²) = (1000 + 0.511)/0.511 ≈ 1000.511 / 0.511 ≈ 1957.95\n\nSo γ ≈ 1957.95\n\nThen,\n\n4 γ E_γ / (m_e c²) = 4 * 1957.95 * 2 eV / (0.511 MeV)\n\nConvert 0.511 MeV to eV: 511,000 eV\n\nSo,\n\n4 * 1957.95 * 2 / 511,000 ≈ (15,663.6) / 511,000 ≈ 0.03065\n\nDenominator: 1 + 0.03065 ≈ 1.03065\n\nNumerator: 4 * γ² * E_γ = 4 * (1957.95)^2 * 2 eV\n\nCompute (1957.95)^2:\n\n1957.95 * 1957.95\n\nLet me compute 1958^2:\n\n= (2000 - 42)^2 = 2000² - 2*2000*42 + 42² = 4,000,000 - 168,000 + 1,764 = 3,833,764\n\nBut since it's 1957.95, which is 1958 - 0.05, so:\n\n(1958 - 0.05)^2 = 1958² - 2*1958*0.05 + 0.05² ≈ 3,833,764 - 195.8 + 0.0025 ≈ 3,833,568.2025\n\nSo approximately 3,833,568.2\n\nMultiply by 4: 4 * 3,833,568.2 ≈ 15,334,272.8\n\nMultiply by 2 eV: 15,334,272.8 * 2 ≈ 30,668,545.6 eV ≈ 30.6685456 MeV\n\nDivide by 1.03065:\n\n30.6685456 / 1.03065 ≈ 29.75 MeV\n\nSo approximately 29.75 MeV.\n\nBut let's check with more precise calculation.\n\nLet me compute 30.6685456 / 1.03065:\n\nFirst, 1.03065 * 29 = 29.88885\n\n1.03065 * 28.8 = ?\n\nWait, 1.03065 * 29 = 30. (1.03065*30=30.9195). Wait, maybe better to do division:\n\n30.6685456 ÷ 1.03065 ≈ ?\n\nLet me approximate:\n\n1.03065 * 29.7 = 1.03065 * 30 - 1.03065 * 0.3 = 30.9195 - 0.309195 ≈ 30.6103\n\nWhich is very close to 30.6685. So 29.7 gives 30.6103, difference is 30.6685 - 30.6103 = 0.0582.\n\nSo per 0.1 increase in multiplier, the result increases by 1.03065 * 0.1 = 0.103065\n\nSo to get 0.0582, need 0.0582 / 0.103065 ≈ 0.565\n\nSo total multiplier is 29.7 + 0.565 ≈ 30.265\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator step.\n\nAlternatively, use approximate value:\n\n30.6685 / 1.03065 ≈ 30.6685 / 1.03 ≈ 29.775 MeV\n\nSo approximately 29.78 MeV.\n\nBut let's use the exact formula:\n\nE'_γ,max = (4 γ² E_γ) / (1 + 4 γ E_γ / (m_e c²))\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nγ = 1957.95\n\nE_γ = 2 eV = 2e-6 MeV\n\nm_e c² = 0.511 MeV\n\nCompute numerator: 4 * (1957.95)^2 * 2e-6 MeV\n\nFirst, (1957.95)^2 = approx 3,833,568 (as before)\n\n4 * 3,833,568 = 15,334,272\n\nMultiply by 2e-6: 15,334,272 * 2e-6 = 30.668544 MeV\n\nDenominator: 1 + (4 * 1957.95 * 2e-6) / 0.511\n\nCompute 4 * 1957.95 * 2e-6 = 15,663.6 * 1e-6 = 0.0156636\n\nDivide by 0.511: 0.0156636 / 0.511 ≈ 0.03065\n\nSo denominator: 1 + 0.03065 = 1.03065\n\nThus, E'_γ,max = 30.668544 / 1.03065 ≈ 29.75 MeV\n\nSo approximately 29.75 MeV.\n\nBut the problem states the kinetic energy of the electron is 1 GeV, which is 1000 times its rest mass (since m_e c² ≈ 0.511 MeV). So using the inverse Compton formula gives us around 30 MeV.\n\nBut wait, the initial approach using conservation laws gave a negative energy, which is impossible, but using the inverse Compton formula gives a positive result. Therefore, the correct approach is the inverse Compton scattering one.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the back-scattered photon is approximately 30 MeV.\n\nBut let me check with exact calculation using the inverse Compton formula.\n\nAlternatively, another formula for maximum energy transfer in inverse Compton scattering is:\n\nE'_γ,max = ( (γ m_e c²) / (1 + (γ m_e c²)/E_γ) ) * (1 + cosθ)\n\nWait, but θ here is the angle in the lab frame. Wait, no, maybe different conventions.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the maximum energy transfer occurs when the photon is scattered directly backwards in the electron's rest frame, leading to the maximum Doppler shift when transformed back to the lab frame.\n\nBut regardless, the formula we used earlier seems standard.\n\nGiven that the calculation gives approximately 29.75 MeV, which is about 30 MeV.\n\nBut let's convert that to eV to see:\n\n29.75 MeV = 29.75 x 10^6 eV = 29,750,000 eV.\n\nThe incident photon energy was 2 eV, so this is a significant increase, as expected in inverse Compton scattering.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be approximately 30 MeV. But let's check precise calculation.\n\nWait, let's compute γ more accurately.\n\nGiven K = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.\n\nγ = (K + m_e c²) / (m_e c²) = (1000 + 0.511)/0.511 ≈ 1000.511 / 0.511 ≈ 1957.164.\n\nSo γ ≈ 1957.16\n\nThen,\n\n4 γ E_γ / (m_e c²) = 4 * 1957.16 * 2 eV / (0.511 MeV)\n\nConvert 0.511 MeV to eV: 511,000 eV.\n\nSo,\n\n4 * 1957.16 * 2 / 511,000 = (15,657.28) / 511,000 ≈ 0.03065\n\nDenominator: 1 + 0.03065 ≈ 1.03065\n\nNumerator: 4 * γ² * E_γ = 4 * (1957.16)^2 * 2 eV\n\nCompute (1957.16)^2:\n\n1957.16 * 1957.16\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, 1957 * 1957 = (2000 - 43)^2 = 2000² - 2*2000*43 + 43² = 4,000,000 - 172,000 + 1,849 = 3,829,849\n\nNow, 1957.16 = 1957 + 0.16\n\nSo (1957 + 0.16)^2 = 1957² + 2*1957*0.16 + 0.16² = 3,829,849 + 626.24 + 0.0256 ≈ 3,830,475.2656\n\nThus, γ² ≈ 3,830,475.2656\n\nMultiply by 4: 4 * 3,830,475.2656 ≈ 15,321,901.0624\n\nMultiply by 2 eV: 15,321,901.0624 * 2 ≈ 30,643,802.1248 eV ≈ 30.6438 MeV\n\nDivide by 1.03065:\n\n30.6438 / 1.03065 ≈ 29.73 MeV\n\nSo approximately 29.73 MeV.\n\nRounding to two decimal places, about 29.73 MeV. But perhaps we should keep more significant figures.\n\nAlternatively, the exact value using precise γ:\n\nγ = (1000 + 0.511)/0.511 = 1000.511 / 0.511 ≈ 1957.164\n\nCompute 4 γ² E_γ:\n\n4 * (1957.164)^2 * 2 eV\n\n(1957.164)^2 = 1957.164 * 1957.164\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\nFirst, 1957 * 1957 = 3,829,849\n\nThen, 1957 * 0.164 = 1957 * 0.1 + 1957 * 0.06 + 1957 * 0.004 = 195.7 + 117.42 + 7.828 = 320.948\n\nSimilarly, 0.164 * 1957 = 320.948\n\n0.164 * 0.164 = 0.026896\n\nSo, (1957 + 0.164)^2 = 1957² + 2*1957*0.164 + 0.164² = 3,829,849 + 2*320.948 + 0.026896 ≈ 3,829,849 + 641.896 + 0.026896 ≈ 3,830,490.9229\n\nThus, γ² ≈ 3,830,490.9229\n\nMultiply by 4: 4 * 3,830,490.9229 ≈ 15,321,963.6916\n\nMultiply by 2 eV: 15,321,963.6916 * 2 ≈ 30,643,927.3832 eV = 30.6439273832 MeV\n\nDenominator: 1 + (4 γ E_γ / (m_e c²)) = 1 + 0.03065 ≈ 1.03065\n\nDivide: 30.6439273832 / 1.03065 ≈ 29.73 MeV\n\nSo approximately 29.73 MeV.\n\nBut the problem might expect an exact answer using symbolic expressions. Let me see if there's a way to express this more neatly.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nE'_γ,max = (4 γ² E_γ) / (1 + 4 γ E_γ / (m_e c²))\n\nBut since 4 γ E_γ / (m_e c²) is much less than 1 (0.03 << 1), we can approximate the denominator as 1, so E'_γ,max ≈ 4 γ² E_γ. But in this case, the denominator is 1.03, so it's a small correction.\n\nBut given that the exact calculation gives approximately 29.73 MeV, which is about 30 MeV. However, considering the precision of the given values (2 eV and 1 GeV), the answer should be given to two significant figures, so 30 MeV.\n\nBut wait, 1 GeV is given as 1 GeV, which is one significant figure, and 2 eV is one significant figure. So the answer should be one significant figure, 30 MeV. But maybe the problem expects more precise.\n\nAlternatively, let", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0}
{"id": "atomic/3-20", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which isotope is the most massive that can be produced with 4.5 GeV of free energy. The options are deuterium (²D), helium-3 (³He), or tritium (³T). Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic concepts here. \n\nFirst, the question is about creating an isotope from nothing, which I assume means through some kind of particle creation or nuclear reaction. But since we're dealing with isotopes, it's probably related to the binding energy and the mass-energy equivalence. Einstein's equation E=mc² comes into play here. The idea is that the energy provided (4.5 GeV) must be equal to or greater than the rest mass energy of the isotope we want to create.\n\nSo, each isotope has a certain mass, and converting that mass into energy using E=mc² will tell us how much energy is required to create it. The most massive isotope would be the one with the highest rest mass that doesn't exceed the 4.5 GeV energy provided. \n\nWait, but isotopes are made up of protons and neutrons. Each proton and neutron has a certain mass. The mass of the isotope isn't just the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of the binding energy (mass defect), but for the purpose of calculating the minimum energy needed to create the isotope, maybe we can approximate it by the sum of the constituent particles? Or do we need to use the actual atomic mass?\n\nLet me think. The rest mass energy of a nucleus is less than the sum of the rest masses of its individual nucleons because of the binding energy (since energy is released when the nucleus forms, so the mass is lower). But if we're creating the nucleus from nothing, we need to provide enough energy to account for the total mass of the nucleus, not the individual nucleons. Wait, no. If we're creating the nucleus from energy, the energy must be at least equal to the rest mass of the nucleus. Because according to E=mc², the energy required to create a mass m is mc². So the free energy available (4.5 GeV) must be equal to or greater than the rest mass energy of the isotope.\n\nTherefore, the key is to calculate the rest mass energy of each isotope and see which one is the largest that is still less than or equal to 4.5 GeV.\n\nBut wait, the rest mass of the isotope includes the protons and neutrons. Let's get the actual masses of each isotope.\n\nFirst, let's recall the atomic masses. The atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So converting u to MeV using that factor.\n\nLet me list the isotopes:\n\n(a) Deuterium (²D or ²H): It has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The atomic mass of deuterium is approximately 2.014102 u.\n\n(b) Helium-3 (³He): 2 protons and 1 neutron. Its atomic mass is about 3.016029 u.\n\n(c) Tritium (³T or ³H): 1 proton and 2 neutrons. Its atomic mass is approximately 3.016049 u.\n\nWait, so tritium is slightly heavier than helium-3? Let me check exact values. \n\nLooking up exact atomic masses:\n\nDeuterium (²H): 2.01410177811 u\n\nHelium-3 (³He): 3.0160293201 u\n\nTritium (³H): 3.0160492779 u\n\nYes, tritium is slightly heavier than helium-3. So the rest mass energy of tritium would be higher than that of helium-3. So if we calculate the rest mass energy for each, tritium would require more energy than helium-3, and deuterium less than both.\n\nBut the question is, which of these can be produced with 4.5 GeV? So converting each isotope's mass to energy and see which is the largest that is under 4.5 GeV.\n\nFirst, let's convert the atomic mass (in u) to energy in GeV.\n\n1 u = 931.5 MeV/c² = 0.9315 GeV/c².\n\nSo for deuterium: 2.0141 u * 0.9315 GeV/u ≈ 2.0141 * 0.9315 ≈ let's calculate that.\n\n2 * 0.9315 = 1.863, 0.0141 * 0.9315 ≈ 0.01313. Total ≈ 1.876 GeV.\n\nHelium-3: 3.01603 u * 0.9315 ≈ 3 * 0.9315 = 2.7945, 0.01603 * 0.9315 ≈ 0.01493. Total ≈ 2.8094 GeV.\n\nTritium: 3.01605 u * 0.9315 ≈ same as helium-3 but slightly higher. Let's compute the exact difference.\n\n3.01605 - 3.01603 = 0.00002 u. So 0.00002 u * 0.9315 GeV/u ≈ 0.00001863 GeV, which is 0.01863 MeV. So tritium's energy is about 2.8094 GeV + 0.00001863 GeV ≈ 2.80941863 GeV. So approximately 2.8094 GeV for helium-3 and 2.8095 GeV for tritium. The difference is negligible here, but tritium is slightly heavier.\n\nSo all three isotopes have rest mass energies well below 4.5 GeV. Wait, but that can't be right. Because 4.5 GeV is 4500 MeV. The rest mass energies we calculated are around 1.8 GeV for deuterium, 2.8 GeV for He-3 and Tritium. So all of them are below 4.5 GeV. Then why is the question asking which is the most massive one possible? Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the binding energy required to form the isotope? Or maybe the energy required is the sum of the individual nucleons' rest mass? Because when you create a nucleus, you need to account for the mass of the individual protons and neutrons, not the bound nucleus. Because the binding energy is the energy that would be released when the nucleus forms, so to create it, you need to provide the energy equivalent to the mass of the individual nucleons minus the binding energy. Wait, no. Wait, if you have energy to create particles, you need to have enough energy for their rest mass. But when you create a nucleus, you can either create it directly (if that's possible) or create the individual nucleons and then bind them. But binding them would release energy, so the total energy required would be the sum of the nucleons' rest masses minus the binding energy. Wait, but that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is simpler: the rest mass energy of the isotope must be less than or equal to the available energy (4.5 GeV). So the isotope's mass (in energy units) must be <= 4.5 GeV. Then, the most massive isotope would be the one with the highest mass (i.e., highest atomic number and mass number) that is under 4.5 GeV. But the options given are all light isotopes: D, He-3, T. But according to the calculation above, even tritium is only about 2.8 GeV. So why is the question giving these options? Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the rest mass of the isotope itself, but the energy required to create it from its constituent particles. For example, if you have protons and neutrons, the binding energy is the energy released when they form a nucleus. So to create the nucleus, you need to input energy equal to the binding energy. But that doesn't make sense because the rest mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the rest masses of the nucleons. So creating the nucleus would require energy equal to the sum of the nucleons' rest masses minus the binding energy. Wait, no. If you have free energy (energy available), you can create mass. The total energy available (4.5 GeV) can be converted into mass. So the maximum mass you can create is 4.5 GeV / c². So the mass of the isotope must be less than or equal to 4.5 GeV/c². Therefore, the isotope with the largest mass (in GeV/c²) that is <=4.5 GeV/c² is the answer.\n\nBut according to the previous calculation, even tritium is only about 2.8 GeV. So why are the options so light? Maybe the question is considering the rest mass of the individual nucleons. For example, to create a nucleus with Z protons and N neutrons, the total rest mass energy would be Z*m_p + N*m_n, where m_p and m_n are the proton and neutron rest masses. Then, the energy required would be the sum of the individual nucleons' rest masses. Because when you create the nucleus, you have to create the protons and neutrons from energy, and then they combine, releasing binding energy. But if you have to create them from nothing, you need to account for their individual rest masses. Wait, but binding energy is energy that is released when the nucleus forms. So if you have 4.5 GeV, you can create particles whose total rest mass is up to 4.5 GeV/c². But if you create individual nucleons, their total rest mass must be <=4.5 GeV. But if you create a nucleus, the rest mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the nucleons' rest masses. Therefore, the maximum number of nucleons you can create would be determined by 4.5 GeV divided by the average nucleon mass. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that to create a nucleus, you need to provide enough energy to account for its rest mass. So the rest mass of the nucleus must be <=4.5 GeV/c². Then, the most massive nucleus (highest mass number) that satisfies this would be the answer. But according to the previous calculation, even tritium is only ~2.8 GeV. So why are the options so light? Maybe the question is in error, or perhaps I'm missing a key point.\n\nWait, maybe the energy is per nucleon? No, the question states 4.5 GeV free energy. So total energy available is 4.5 GeV. So the total rest mass energy of the created isotope must be less than or equal to 4.5 GeV. Therefore, the isotope's mass (in energy units) must be <=4.5 GeV. But the given options all have masses much lower than that. So perhaps the question is actually asking about the mass number? But 4.5 GeV is equivalent to about 4.5 / 0.938 ≈ 4.8 proton masses. Wait, a proton is about 938 MeV/c², which is ~0.938 GeV/c². So 4.5 GeV / 0.938 GeV per proton ≈ ~4.8 protons. So you could theoretically create up to about 4 or 5 nucleons. But the options given are isotopes with 2, 3, and 3 nucleons. So maybe the most massive isotope possible would be something with 4 or 5 nucleons, but the options don't include that. Wait, the options are (a) D (2 nucleons), (b) He-3 (3), (c) T (3). So among these, He-3 and T both have 3 nucleons, but T is slightly heavier. So the answer would be (c) ³T.\n\nBut according to the rest mass calculation, tritium is about 3.016 u, which is 3.016 * 0.9315 ≈ 2.81 GeV. So 2.81 GeV is less than 4.5 GeV. So why can't we create a heavier isotope? Maybe because the question is considering that you need to create the isotope from protons and neutrons, and each nucleon requires around 0.938 GeV. So for 4.5 GeV, you can create up to 4.5 / 0.938 ≈ 4.8 nucleons. So you could create an isotope with up to 4 nucleons. But the options don't include such an isotope. The options are up to 3 nucleons. So perhaps the answer is (c) ³T, as it's the heaviest among the options. But why can't we create, say, helium-4 (4 nucleons)? The rest mass of helium-4 is about 4.0026 u, which is 4.0026 * 0.9315 ≈ 3.73 GeV. That's still under 4.5 GeV. So why isn't that an option? The given options are only up to 3 nucleons. So maybe the question is flawed, but given the options, the answer is (c) ³T.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the question. Maybe the \"free energy\" refers to the energy available after considering some other constraints. For example, in particle physics, creating particles requires conservation laws like baryon number, charge, etc. So even if you have enough energy, you need to have the right balance of particles. For example, creating a nucleus requires a certain number of protons and neutrons, which have baryon number +1 each. Also, charge must be conserved. So if you create a nucleus with charge +Z, you need to create Z protons and (A-Z) neutrons, but also electrons to balance charge if necessary. Wait, but the question says \"produce from nothing\", so perhaps assuming that the system is created from energy with conservation of charge, baryon number, etc. But in reality, creating a nucleus from nothing would require that the total charge is zero unless you also create other particles to balance it. For example, if you create a nucleus with charge +Z, you need to create -Z charge elsewhere, like electrons. But electrons have much smaller mass, so their energy requirement is negligible compared to nucleons. So for example, creating a deuterium nucleus (charge +1) would require also creating an electron (charge -1) to balance the charge. But the mass of the electron is about 0.511 MeV, which is negligible compared to the GeV scale. So the total energy required would be the mass of the deuterium plus the electron, which is still around 2.0141 u * 931.5 MeV/u + 0.511 MeV ≈ ~1876 MeV + 0.5 MeV ≈ 1876.5 MeV, which is ~1.8765 GeV. Still way below 4.5 GeV.\n\nBut if you need to create, say, helium-3 (charge +2), you would need to create two electrons to balance the charge. So 3.01603 u * 931.5 MeV/u + 2*0.511 MeV ≈ ~2809 MeV + 1.022 MeV ≈ 2810 MeV or ~2.81 GeV. Similarly, tritium (charge +1) would require one electron: 3.01605 u * 931.5 + 0.511 ≈ ~2809.5 MeV + 0.511 ≈ ~2810 MeV. So even with electrons, the total energy is still under 4.5 GeV. So why can't we create a larger nucleus?\n\nWait, maybe the question is not considering charge balance. If we ignore charge conservation, then we could create a nucleus with any charge, but in reality, that's not possible. However, the question might be simplifying and assuming that the energy required is just the rest mass of the nucleus, ignoring other particles needed for charge conservation. In that case, the rest mass of the nucleus must be <=4.5 GeV. So the most massive isotope possible would be the one with the highest mass (in GeV/c²) that is <=4.5 GeV. But according to the previous calculations, even helium-4 is only ~3.73 GeV. So why isn't that an option? The given options are D, He-3, T. So among these, T is the most massive. Therefore, the answer is (c) ³T.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another factor. The binding energy. If the energy required is the sum of the individual nucleons' rest masses, then the total energy needed would be higher than the rest mass of the nucleus. For example, to create a nucleus with A nucleons, you need to provide the sum of the individual masses of A protons and neutrons, which is higher than the actual nucleus mass. But in reality, when creating particles from energy, you need to create the actual particles. So if you create a nucleus, you need energy equal to its rest mass. But if you create individual nucleons, you need energy equal to their rest masses. However, creating a nucleus from energy directly might not be possible; you might need to create the individual nucleons first, which would require more energy. But the question says \"produce from nothing\", which I think refers to creating the isotope directly from energy, so the energy required is the rest mass of the isotope. Therefore, the answer should be the heaviest isotope among the options that has a rest mass energy <=4.5 GeV. Since all options are way below 4.5 GeV, but the heaviest is tritium, the answer is (c) ³T.\n\nBut wait, maybe the question is considering that the free energy is the energy available after considering the binding energy. For example, the binding energy is the energy needed to hold the nucleus together. So if you have 4.5 GeV, you can use that energy to create the nucleons and also provide the binding energy. Wait, no. The binding energy is the energy that would be released when the nucleus forms. So if you have to create the nucleus, you need to supply the energy equivalent to the mass of the nucleus. The binding energy is already accounted for in the mass deficit. So the rest mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons, but the energy required to create the nucleus is just its rest mass energy. Therefore, the available energy (4.5 GeV) must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the nucleus. Since all the given options are below 4.5 GeV, the heaviest possible among them is tritium. Therefore, the answer is (c) ³T.\n\nBut why are the options so light? Maybe the question is from a textbook problem where the available energy is lower, but here it's 4.5 GeV. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the question. But given the options, the correct answer is (c) ³T.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the most massive isotope that can be produced with 4.5 GeV of free energy, we compare the rest mass energies of the given isotopes. Using the conversion \\(1 \\, \\text{u} = 931.5 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2 = 0.9315 \\, \\text{GeV}/c^2\\), we calculate:\n\n1. **Deuterium (\\(^2\\text{D}\\))**:  \n   Atomic mass = \\(2.0141 \\, \\text{u}\\)  \n   Rest mass energy = \\(2.0141 \\times 0.9315 \\approx 1.876 \\, \\text{GeV}\\).\n\n2. **Helium-3 (\\(^3\\text{He}\\))**:  \n   Atomic mass = \\(3.01603 \\, \\text{u}\\)  \n   Rest mass energy = \\(3.01603 \\times 0.9315 \\approx 2.809 \\, \\text{GeV}\\).\n\n3. **Tritium (\\(^3\\text{T}\\))**:  \n   Atomic mass = \\(3.01605 \\, \\text{u}\\)  \n   Rest mass energy = \\(3.01605 \\times 0.9315 \\approx 2.8095 \\, \\text{GeV}\\).\n\nAll three isotopes have rest mass energies well below 4.5 GeV. Among the options, tritium (\\(^3\\text{T}\\)) is slightly heavier than helium-3 (\\(^3\\text{He}\\)) due to its higher atomic mass. Therefore, the most massive isotope that can theoretically be produced with 4.5 GeV is **tritium**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["C"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "C", "expr2": "^2\\text{D}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/3-45", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many out of one million 1-GeV neutrinos would interact when passing through the Earth. The given parameters are the cross-section σ = 0.7 × 10⁻³⁸ cm² per nucleon, Earth's radius R = 6000 km, density ρ ≈ 5 g/cm², and average atomic mass number ⟨A⟩ = 20. The options are all, about 25, or none. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how neutrino interactions work. Neutrinos interact very weakly, so their cross-sections are tiny. The probability of interaction depends on the cross-section, the number of target nucleons in the path, and maybe the flux or something. Let me think. The basic formula for interaction probability is P = N × σ, where N is the number of targets (nucleons here) per area, right? Wait, actually, the formula for the probability is P = n × σ × x, where n is the number density of targets, σ is the cross-section, and x is the path length. But maybe it's better to think in terms of the total cross-sectional area and the column density.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of interactions is given by the product of the number of neutrinos, the cross-section per target nucleon, the number of nucleons per area along the path. Wait, maybe I need to calculate the total number of nucleons along the neutrino's path through the Earth and multiply by the cross-section per nucleon. Then, the probability for a single neutrino is N_nucleons × σ, and the expected number of interactions for a million neutrinos would be 1e6 × N_nucleons × σ. But I need to compute N_nucleons.\n\nWait, let's break it down step by step. The Earth's radius is given as 6000 km, which is 6 × 10^8 cm. The density is given as ρ ≈ 5 g/cm². Wait, hold on, density is usually in g/cm³. Wait, the problem says ρ ≈ 5 g/cm². Hmm, that's unusual. Wait, maybe that's a typo? Because density is per volume. Wait, maybe it's a column density? Wait, the problem statement says \"ρ ≈ 5 g/cm²\", but that's not standard. Let me check again. Oh, maybe it's a typo and should be g/cm³. Because 5 g/cm³ is reasonable for Earth's average density. For example, Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So maybe that's a typo. Let me assume that ρ is 5 g/cm³. Otherwise, if it's 5 g/cm², that would be a mass per area, which is different. Hmm. But the problem says \"ρ ≈ 5 g/cm²\", which is mass per area. Wait, but that's not standard. Wait, maybe it's a column density, which is mass per area (g/cm²). But then how does that relate to the actual density? Let me think. If the Earth's radius is R, then the column density (mass per area) would be ρ × R, where ρ is the volume density (g/cm³) and R is the path length in cm. So if the problem gives ρ as 5 g/cm², that might actually be the column density. Wait, but the standard way to compute the column density is ρ (g/cm³) multiplied by the path length (cm) gives g/cm². So if the problem gives ρ ≈ 5 g/cm², that would be the column density. Wait, but then the actual density would be column density divided by path length. Wait, but the problem states ρ ≈ 5 g/cm², which is mass per area. Hmm. Maybe the problem is using a different notation. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem states: σ = 0.7 × 10⁻³⁸ cm²/n (per nucleon), R = 6000 km, ρ ≈ 5 g/cm², ⟨A⟩ = 20. So ρ is given in g/cm². That's mass per area. So perhaps the column density is given directly as 5 g/cm². Then, how does that relate to the number of nucleons?\n\nWait, column density (Σ) is mass per area (g/cm²). To get the number of nucleons per area, we can take Σ (g/cm²) divided by the mass per nucleon. The average atomic mass is ⟨A⟩ = 20, so each nucleus has mass approximately 20 atomic mass units. The mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 1 atomic mass unit. So for a nucleus of mass number A, the mass per nucleus is A × m_nucleon. Therefore, the number of nuclei per cm² is Σ / (A × m_nucleon), and since each nucleus has A nucleons, the number of nucleons per cm² is (Σ / (A × m_nucleon)) × A = Σ / m_nucleon. Wait, that's interesting. Because the number of nucleons per cm² would be Σ divided by the mass of a nucleon. Let me check that.\n\nIf the column density Σ is mass per area (g/cm²), then the number of nucleons per cm² is Σ (g/cm²) / (m_nucleon (g)). The mass of a nucleon is approximately 1.67 × 10⁻²⁴ g. So Σ / m_nucleon = 5 g/cm² / (1.67 × 10⁻²⁴ g/nucleon) ≈ 3 × 10²⁴ nucleons/cm². Then, the cross-section per nucleon is σ = 0.7 × 10⁻³⁸ cm²/nucleon. So the probability of interaction per neutrino is N_nucleons × σ = (3 × 10²⁴ cm⁻²) × (0.7 × 10⁻³⁸ cm²) = 2.1 × 10⁻¹⁴. So the probability for one neutrino is about 2.1 × 10⁻¹⁴. Then, for one million neutrinos (1e6), the expected number of interactions is 1e6 × 2.1 × 10⁻¹⁴ = 2.1 × 10⁻⁸. That's 0.000000021, which is practically zero. So the answer would be (c) none. But wait, the options are (a) all, (b) ≈25, (c) none. But according to this calculation, the expected number is 2.1e-8, which is way less than 1. So none of the neutrinos interact. So answer (c). But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem gives R = 6000 km. But if the column density is given as 5 g/cm², then the actual path length through the Earth is not needed? Wait, column density is Σ = ρ × X, where X is the path length. But if Σ is given as 5 g/cm², then even if the Earth's radius is 6000 km, maybe the problem is simplifying by giving Σ directly. So perhaps the calculation is Σ = 5 g/cm². Then, number of nucleons per cm² is Σ / (m_nucleon). m_nucleon is 1.67e-24 g. So 5 / 1.67e-24 ≈ 3e24 nucleons/cm². Then, cross-section per nucleon is 0.7e-38 cm². So the probability per neutrino is 3e24 * 0.7e-38 = 2.1e-14. Multiply by 1e6 neutrinos: 2.1e-8 interactions. So effectively zero. So answer (c). But wait, maybe I messed up the units. Let me check again.\n\nWait, cross-section σ is in cm² per nucleon. The column density gives the number of nucleons per cm². So when you multiply σ (cm²/nucleon) by number of nucleons/cm², you get cm²/nucleon * nucleons/cm² = cm² * nucleons/(nucleon * cm²) = dimensionless, which is the probability. So yes, that's correct. So 0.7e-38 cm²/n * 3e24 n/cm² = 2.1e-14. So per neutrino, the probability is 2.1e-14. For a million neutrinos, 1e6 * 2.1e-14 = 2.1e-8. So effectively zero. So answer (c) none. But wait, the options include (b) ≈25. Maybe I did something wrong here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the Earth's radius to compute the column density. If the problem had given the density as 5 g/cm³ (volume density), then the column density would be ρ * X, where X is the path length. Let's try that approach. Let's assume that ρ is 5 g/cm³ (volume density), and the path length is the diameter of the Earth, which is 2R = 12,000 km = 1.2e9 cm. Then, column density Σ = ρ * X = 5 g/cm³ * 1.2e9 cm = 6e9 g/cm². Wait, that's way higher than the given 5 g/cm². So if the problem says ρ ≈ 5 g/cm², but actually meant volume density 5 g/cm³, then the column density would be 5 g/cm³ * 1.2e9 cm = 6e9 g/cm². Then, number of nucleons per cm² would be Σ / (m_nucleon) = 6e9 g/cm² / 1.67e-24 g/nucleon ≈ 3.6e33 nucleons/cm². Then, cross-section 0.7e-38 cm²/nucleon. So probability per neutrino is 3.6e33 * 0.7e-38 = 2.52e-5. Then, for a million neutrinos, 1e6 * 2.52e-5 = 25.2 interactions. So that would be answer (b) ≈25. But this contradicts the previous calculation. So which is it?\n\nAh, here's the confusion. The problem states ρ ≈ 5 g/cm². If that's the column density (as given), then the first calculation applies, leading to answer (c). But if ρ is actually the volume density (5 g/cm³) and the problem made a typo, then the column density is ρ * X = 5 g/cm³ * 1.2e9 cm = 6e9 g/cm², leading to answer (b). But the problem explicitly says ρ ≈ 5 g/cm², so maybe the first approach is correct. However, in reality, Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³, so if the problem intended that, but wrote g/cm², then there's a mistake. But as a student, I have to go with the given data. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"ρ ≈ 5 g/cm²\". The units are grams per square centimeter. That's mass per area, not per volume. So column density. So the calculation where Σ = 5 g/cm² is correct. Then, number of nucleons per cm² is 5 / (1.67e-24) ≈ 3e24. Then, cross-section 0.7e-38. Multiply to get 2.1e-14 per neutrino. So for a million, 2.1e-8. So answer (c). But why is option (b) there? Maybe the problem intended to give the density as 5 g/cm³ and the radius 6000 km, leading to a column density of 5 * 2*6000 km (diameter). Let's compute that.\n\nRadius R = 6000 km = 6e5 meters = 6e8 cm. So diameter is 1.2e9 cm. If density ρ = 5 g/cm³, then column density Σ = ρ * X = 5 g/cm³ * 1.2e9 cm = 6e9 g/cm². Then, number of nucleons per cm² is 6e9 / 1.67e-24 ≈ 3.6e33. Then, cross-section 0.7e-38. So 3.6e33 * 0.7e-38 = 2.52e-5 per neutrino. For a million, 25.2. So answer (b). But the problem states ρ ≈ 5 g/cm², not 5 g/cm³. So this is conflicting. Maybe the problem mixed up units. If the problem intended ρ as 5 g/cm³, then answer is (b). But given that the problem says g/cm², which is column density, answer is (c). But why is the Earth's radius given then? If the column density is given directly, the radius is redundant. So perhaps the problem intended to give density in g/cm³ and the radius, and the student is supposed to compute the column density. Let's try that.\n\nAssuming ρ = 5 g/cm³ (volume density), Earth radius R = 6000 km = 6e8 cm. The path length through Earth would be approximately the diameter, 2R = 1.2e9 cm. Then, column density Σ = ρ * path length = 5 g/cm³ * 1.2e9 cm = 6e9 g/cm². Then, number of nucleons per cm² is Σ / (mass per nucleon). Mass per nucleon is 1.67e-24 g. So 6e9 / 1.67e-24 ≈ 3.6e33 nucleons/cm². Then, cross-section per nucleon is 0.7e-38 cm². So interaction probability per neutrino is 3.6e33 * 0.7e-38 = 2.52e-5. For one million neutrinos, 1e6 * 2.52e-5 ≈ 25.2. So answer (b). But the problem states ρ ≈ 5 g/cm². So this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement. But as a student, I need to work with what's given. If the problem says ρ ≈ 5 g/cm², then the answer is (c). But given that the Earth's radius is provided, which is not needed if Σ is given, it's more likely that the problem expects the student to compute the column density using ρ in g/cm³ and path length. Therefore, despite the typo, the intended answer is (b).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses the formula for the interaction probability as P = N * σ, where N is the number of targets (nucleons) along the path. To compute N, we need the total number of nucleons in the Earth that a neutrino passes through. The Earth's radius is 6000 km, so the path length is the diameter, 12,000 km = 1.2e9 cm. The density is 5 g/cm³ (assuming typo), so the mass density is 5 g/cm³. The number of nuclei per cm³ is density / (A * m_nucleon). Since A = 20, each nucleus has 20 nucleons. Wait, number density of nuclei is ρ / (A * m_nucleon) = 5 g/cm³ / (20 * 1.67e-24 g) ≈ 5 / (3.34e-23) ≈ 1.5e23 nuclei/cm³. Then, number of nucleons per cm³ is 20 * 1.5e23 = 3e24 nucleons/cm³. The total path length is 1.2e9 cm. So total nucleons per cm² (since it's per area) is nucleons/cm³ * path length (cm) = 3e24 * 1.2e9 = 3.6e33 nucleons/cm². Then, cross-section is 0.7e-38 cm²/nucleon. So interaction probability per neutrino is 3.6e33 * 0.7e-38 = 2.52e-5. Multiply by 1e6 neutrinos: 25.2. So answer (b). Therefore, despite the problem stating ρ as 5 g/cm², if we assume it's a typo and should be 5 g/cm³, then answer is (b). But given the problem as written, with ρ in g/cm², answer is (c). However, given that the Earth's radius is provided, which is necessary for calculating the column density from volume density, it's more likely that the problem intended ρ to be in g/cm³. Therefore, the correct answer is (b) ≈25.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"ρ ≈ 5 g/cm²\". If that's correct, then column density is 5 g/cm². Then, number of nucleons/cm² is 5 / 1.67e-24 ≈ 3e24. Then, cross-section 0.7e-38. So 3e24 * 0.7e-38 = 2.1e-14 per neutrino. For a million, 2.1e-8. So answer (c). But why is the Earth's radius given then? It's not needed if column density is provided. So this suggests that the problem has a mistake. But as a student, I need to reconcile the given data. If the problem gives ρ in g/cm², then answer is (c). But given that Earth's radius is provided, and the average density is usually in g/cm³, it's likely a typo. Therefore, the intended answer is (b).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses a different approach. Let's think again. The formula for the interaction probability is P = N * σ, where N is the number of targets (nucleons) encountered along the path. To find N, we need the number of nucleons per cm² times the area. Wait, no. The number of targets is the number of nucleons per cm² times the area in cm² that the neutrino beam covers. But since we're considering a single neutrino, it's just the number of nucleons per cm² along the path. Wait, maybe the formula is P = Σ_n * σ, where Σ_n is the number of nucleons per cm². Yes, that's correct. So Σ_n = Σ_mass / m_nucleon. Σ_mass is given as 5 g/cm². So Σ_n = 5 / 1.67e-24 ≈ 3e24 nucleons/cm². Then, σ = 0.7e-38 cm²/nucleon. So P = 3e24 * 0.7e-38 = 2.1e-14. For a million neutrinos, 1e6 * 2.1e-14 = 2.1e-8. So effectively zero. Answer (c). But this ignores the Earth's radius. So why is R given? Maybe the problem expects us to calculate the column density using the Earth's radius and the density. If the density is given as 5 g/cm³, then column density is ρ * 2R. Let's do that. ρ = 5 g/cm³, 2R = 1.2e9 cm. Σ = 5 * 1.2e9 = 6e9 g/cm². Then Σ_n = 6e9 / 1.67e-24 ≈ 3.6e33. Then P = 3.6e33 * 0.7e-38 = 2.52e-5. For a million, 25.2. So answer (b). Therefore, the confusion is whether the given ρ is in g/cm² or g/cm³. Given that the problem states ρ ≈ 5 g/cm², but also provides R, which is needed to compute the column density if ρ is in g/cm³, it's likely that there's a mistake in the problem, and ρ should be 5 g/cm³. Therefore, the intended answer is (b) ≈25.\n\nBut as a careful student, I should note the discrepancy. However, given the options, and the standard approach to such problems, where you calculate the column density as ρ (g/cm³) * path length (cm), and given that Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³, it's probable that the problem intended ρ to be 5 g/cm³. Therefore, the correct answer is (b) ≈25.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many of one million 1-GeV neutrinos interact when traversing the Earth, we use the interaction probability formula \\( P = N \\cdot \\sigma \\), where \\( N \\) is the number of target nucleons per cm², and \\( \\sigma = 0.7 \\times 10^{-38} \\, \\text{cm}^2/\\text{nucleon} \\).\n\n1. **Column Density Calculation**:  \n   Assuming the problem intended the density \\( \\rho = 5 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3 \\) (a common Earth density value), the column density \\( \\Sigma \\) (mass per area) is:  \n   \\[\n   \\Sigma = \\rho \\cdot X = 5 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3 \\cdot 1.2 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{cm} = 6 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{g/cm}^2\n   \\]  \n   Here, \\( X = 2R = 1.2 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{cm} \\) is the path length (Earth's diameter).\n\n2. **Number of Nucleons per cm²**:  \n   The number of nucleons per cm² is:  \n   \\[\n   N = \\frac{\\Sigma}{m_{\\text{nucleon}}} = \\frac{6 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{g/cm}^2}{1.67 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{g}} \\approx 3.6 \\times 10^{33} \\, \\text{nucleons/cm}^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Interaction Probability per Neutrino**:  \n   The probability for one neutrino to interact is:  \n   \\[\n   P = N \\cdot \\sigma = 3.6 \\times 10^{33} \\cdot 0.7 \\times 10^{-38} = 2.52 \\times 10^{-5}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Expected Interactions for 1 Million Neutrinos**:  \n   For \\( 10^6 \\) neutrinos:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Interactions} = 10^6 \\cdot 2.52 \\times 10^{-5} \\approx 25.2\n   \\]\n\nGiven the likely correction of \\( \\rho \\) to \\( 5 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3 \\), the expected number of interactions is approximately **25**.  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["B"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "B", "expr2": "25"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "B", "expr2": "25"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/3-42", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these neutrino questions one by one. Starting with part (a). I remember that neutrinos come in different flavors corresponding to the charged leptons: electron, muon, and tau. So there are three types, right? Electron neutrino, muon neutrino, and tau neutrino. As for the spin, neutrinos are fermions, so they should have half-integer spin. Since they're leptons like electrons, which have spin 1/2, neutrinos must also have spin 1/2. Wait, but I think neutrinos are spin-1/2 particles. Yeah, that's right. So part (a) is three types and spin 1/2.\n\nMoving to part (b). The question is about conserved properties in scattering processes. For neutrinos, I think lepton number is conserved. Each neutrino has a corresponding lepton number for its generation. Also, in weak interactions, maybe other quantum numbers like lepton family numbers are conserved? Wait, but in some processes like neutrino oscillations, the flavor can change, which would imply that individual lepton numbers aren't conserved. Hmm, but in specific interactions, like the one given here, maybe the conservation is per generation. Let me think. The reaction given is ν_μ + e^- → μ^- + ?. So on the left side, we have a muon neutrino and an electron. The lepton numbers: for muon, the neutrino is +1, and the electron is -1 (since it's an electron, but wait, electrons have electron lepton number +1). Wait, the particles are ν_μ (muon neutrino) and e^- (electron). So the initial lepton numbers are: electron lepton number is +1 (from e^-), muon lepton number is +1 (from ν_μ). On the right side, we have a muon (μ^-), which has muon lepton number +1, and the missing particle. So the missing particle must have electron lepton number +1 to balance the initial electron lepton number. But the initial electron lepton number is +1 (from e^-), so the right side must also have +1. The μ^- has 0 electron lepton number, so the missing particle must have electron lepton number +1. But what particles have electron lepton number? An electron neutrino? Wait, but the reaction is a muon neutrino colliding with an electron to produce a muon and something else. Let's check the conservation. Charge: ν_μ is neutral, e^- is -1. On the right, μ^- is -1, so the missing particle must be neutral to balance charge. So the missing particle is neutral. Lepton numbers: initial electron lepton number is +1 (from e^-), muon lepton number +1 (from ν_μ). On the right, μ^- has muon lepton number +1, so the missing particle must have electron lepton number +1. So it's an electron neutrino? But wait, but in weak interactions, when a neutrino scatters off a charged lepton, the process might involve a charged current. Wait, the reaction ν_μ + e^- → μ^- + ?. Let's think about the weak interaction vertices. The muon neutrino interacts via the weak force. If this is a charged current interaction, the neutrino would emit a W boson. But the electron is charged. Maybe the electron emits or absorbs a W boson. Wait, but the process would need to conserve charge. Let me think. The initial charge is -1 (from e^-). The final charge is -1 (from μ^-), so the missing particle must be neutral. So the missing particle is a neutrino. But which type? Let's see. The initial lepton numbers: electron: +1, muon: +1. The final muon has muon lepton +1, so the missing particle must have electron lepton +1, which would be an electron neutrino. So the missing particle is ν_e. Wait, but let me check. The reaction is ν_μ + e^- → μ^- + ν_e. Does that conserve lepton numbers? Let's see: initial electron lepton number: 1 (from e^-), muon: 1 (from ν_μ). Final: muon lepton number 1 (from μ^-), electron lepton number 1 (from ν_e). Yes, that works. So the missing particle is ν_e. Therefore, the difference between neutrino and antineutrino is their lepton number. A neutrino has lepton number +1 for its type, and an antineutrino has -1. So in interactions, you have to conserve lepton numbers, so you can't swap a neutrino with an antineutrino without changing the lepton numbers. For example, in beta decay, a neutron decays into a proton, electron, and antineutrino: n → p + e^- + ν̄_e. The antineutrino here has electron lepton number -1, balancing the electron's +1. So the main difference is lepton number. As for conserved properties in scattering, I think lepton number (total and per type) is conserved, along with charge, energy, momentum, etc. But maybe in some interactions, like if it's a charged current, the weak isospin is involved. But the question is about properties conserved. So probably lepton numbers for each flavor are conserved in the scattering processes. Wait, but in the Standard Model, with massless neutrinos, the flavor is conserved. But if neutrinos have mass and mix, then flavor isn't conserved. However, in individual interactions (like scattering), the interaction is via the weak force, which couples to flavor eigenstates. So in the given reaction, the conservation is per flavor. So in the example, the missing particle is ν_e. So the answer for part (b) is that lepton numbers (per flavor) are conserved. The difference between neutrino and antineutrino is their lepton number (neutrino has +1, antineutrino -1). The missing particle is ν_e.\n\nPart (c): If neutrino mass is zero, does it have a magnetic moment? Magnetic moment for a Dirac particle usually requires mass because the magnetic moment operator involves the mass. For a massless particle, maybe the magnetic moment is zero. Because the magnetic moment μ ≈ (eħ)/(2m), so if m=0, μ would be undefined unless there's another way. But neutrinos are neutral, so their magnetic moment would come from higher-order processes. Wait, neutrinos are neutral, so their magnetic moment would be a transition moment between different flavors? Or maybe even for the same flavor, but since they're neutral, the regular magnetic moment (diagonal in flavor) would be zero. But even so, for a massless neutrino, the Standard Model predicts a tiny magnetic moment, but if mass is zero, maybe it's zero. Alternatively, maybe if the neutrino is Majorana, they can't have a magnetic moment. Wait, but the question says assume mass is zero. So if the neutrino is massless, then it's a Weyl fermion. Weyl fermions are chiral, right-handed or left-handed. For a neutrino, which is left-handed, and antineutrino right-handed. In the Standard Model, neutrinos are left-handed, and their magnetic moment would require a right-handed component, which they don't have if they're massless. So if the neutrino is massless, it can't have a magnetic moment because that would require a transition between left and right-handed states, which don't exist for massless particles. Therefore, the magnetic moment is zero.\n\nAs for the spin direction: for a massless particle, the spin is aligned with the direction of motion (helicity). So a neutrino (left-handed) would have its spin opposite to its momentum direction. Wait, helicity is the projection of spin onto momentum. For a massless particle, helicity is a good quantum number. So a left-handed neutrino has helicity -1/2 (spin opposite to momentum), and a right-handed antineutrino has helicity +1/2 (spin aligned with momentum). Wait, but wait: the neutrino is left-handed, which for a massless particle means helicity -1/2 (spin opposite to direction of motion). So the spin points opposite to the direction of motion. The antineutrino is right-handed, so spin points in the same direction as motion. So for a neutrino (particle), spin is opposite to momentum; antineutrino spin is same as momentum. So the answer for (c) is: neutrino has no magnetic moment if mass is zero. Neutrino spin points opposite to its direction of motion, antineutrino spin points along direction of motion.\n\nPart (d): Velocity of a 3K neutrino with mass 0.1 eV. So this is a relic neutrino from the cosmic neutrino background, similar to the CMB but for neutrinos. The temperature is 3 K, but wait, neutrinos decoupled earlier, so their temperature is actually lower than the CMB. Wait, the CMB is about 2.7 K, but neutrinos have a temperature of about 1.95 K because after neutrino decoupling, the photons were heated by electron-positron annihilation, which neutrinos didn't partake in. But the question says 3 K, so maybe we can take T = 3 K. The average thermal energy of a neutrino would be roughly k_B * T. But since neutrinos are fermions, their average energy is on the order of k_B*T. But if the neutrino is non-relativistic, then the velocity can be estimated using thermal velocity. But first, check if 0.1 eV mass is non-relativistic at 3 K. Let's compute k_B*T in eV. T = 3 K. k_B is Boltzmann constant, 8.617×10^-5 eV/K. So k_B*T ≈ 3 * 8.617e-5 ≈ 2.585e-4 eV. The neutrino mass is 0.1 eV, which is much larger than the thermal energy (0.0002585 eV), so the neutrinos are non-relativistic. Therefore, their velocity can be approximated using (1/2)m v^2 ≈ (3/2)k_B T. So v ≈ sqrt(3k_B T / m). Plugging in numbers: m = 0.1 eV. But need to convert everything into SI units to get velocity in m/s. Alternatively, use energy in eV and mass in eV/c². Let's see. The thermal energy (3/2)k_B T = (3/2)*2.585e-4 eV ≈ 3.878e-4 eV. The kinetic energy is (1/2)m v². So (1/2)m v² = 3.878e-4 eV. But m is 0.1 eV/c². So (1/2)*(0.1 eV/c²)*v² = 3.878e-4 eV. Multiply both sides by 2c²/(0.1 eV): v² = (2*3.878e-4 eV * c²)/(0.1 eV) ) = (7.756e-4 / 0.1) c² = 7.756e-3 c². So v = sqrt(7.756e-3) c ≈ 0.088 c. Since c ≈ 3e8 m/s, v ≈ 0.088 * 3e8 ≈ 2.64e7 m/s. But let me check the calculation again. Wait, the thermal energy for a non-relativistic gas is (3/2)k_B T. So KE = (3/2)k_B T. So (1/2)m v² = (3/2)k_B T. Then v = sqrt(3k_B T / m). Let's compute that. k_B T in eV: 3 K * 8.617e-5 eV/K ≈ 2.585e-4 eV. So 3k_B T = 7.755e-4 eV. Divide by m = 0.1 eV/c²: 7.755e-4 / 0.1 = 7.755e-3 c². So v = sqrt(7.755e-3 c²) = sqrt(7.755e-3) * c ≈ 0.088 c. So velocity is approximately 8.8% the speed of light. That's roughly 2.64e7 m/s. But maybe the question expects a more approximate answer. Alternatively, using T = 3 K, m = 0.1 eV. Alternatively, maybe they used the relation for thermal velocity v = sqrt( (3k_B T)/m ). But yeah, the answer would be approximately 0.088c or 8.8% of the speed of light.\n</think>\n\n(a) There are **three known types** of neutrinos: electron neutrino ($\\nu_e$), muon neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$), and tau neutrino ($\\nu_\\tau$).

{"id": "atomic/1-31", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the spin-orbit splitting of the hydrogen 2p state. The options given are 10^-6, 10^-4, 10^-2, or 10^0 eV. Hmm, spin-orbit splitting... right, that's the energy difference due to the interaction between the electron's spin and its orbital motion. But wait, hydrogen is a one-electron atom, so maybe the splitting is smaller compared to multi-electron atoms?\n\nWait, I remember that in hydrogen, the fine structure comes from relativistic corrections, including the spin-orbit interaction. The formula for the spin-orbit energy splitting might be important here. Let me recall. The splitting ΔE is proportional to (Zα)^4 multiplied by some factors involving the principal quantum number n and the angular momentum quantum number l. \n\nThe formula for the fine structure splitting between levels with the same n and l but different j (total angular momentum) is given by something like ΔE = (α² * Rydberg) * (Z²) / (n³ (l(l+1)) )) but I might be mixing up the exact expression. Wait, the Rydberg constant here is about 13.6 eV. But since this is hydrogen, Z=1. \n\nAlternatively, the spin-orbit coupling energy is given by E_{so} = ( (e^2)/(8πε₀ m_e² c²) ) * (1/(r^3)) ) * ( (l·s) ). But since we're looking for the splitting between j = l + 1/2 and j = l - 1/2, the expectation value of l·s would be different for these two states. \n\nFor a p orbital, l=1. So j can be 3/2 or 1/2. The splitting between these two j states is the spin-orbit splitting. The expectation value of l·s for each j state can be calculated. The operator l·s is (j² - l² - s²)/2. So for each j, the expectation value is [j(j+1) - l(l+1) - s(s+1)]/(2ℏ²) multiplied by ℏ². So for j=3/2, that would be [ (3/2)(5/2) - 1(2) - (1/2)(3/2) ] / 2. Let's compute that: (15/4 - 2 - 3/4)/2 = (15/4 - 8/4 - 3/4)/2 = (4/4)/2 = (1)/2. So 1/2 * ℏ². For j=1/2, it's [ (1/2)(3/2) - 1(2) - (1/2)(3/2) ] /2 = (3/4 - 2 - 3/4)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1 * ℏ². Wait, but the difference between the two j states would be the difference in their l·s values. So the difference is (1/2 - (-1)) = 3/2 in terms of ℏ². \n\nBut the spin-orbit energy is proportional to this expectation value. So the splitting ΔE would be proportional to (3/2) times the coefficient. The coefficient is (e²/(8πε₀ m_e² c²)) * <1/r^3>. \n\nNow, the expectation value of 1/r^3 for hydrogen. For a hydrogen atom with principal quantum number n and angular momentum l, <1/r^3> = (Z^3)/(n^3 l(l+1/2)(l+1) a₀³), where a₀ is the Bohr radius. Wait, let me check. The expectation value for 1/r^3 in hydrogen is given by:\n\n⟨1/r³⟩ = (Z³)/(n³ l(l + 1/2)(l + 1) a₀³)\n\nYes, that's the formula. For the 2p state, n=2, l=1. So substituting:\n\n⟨1/r³⟩ = (1³)/(2³ * 1*(1 + 1/2)*(1 + 1) a₀³) = 1/(8 * 1 * 3/2 * 2 a₀³) = 1/(8 * 3/2 * 2) = 1/(8 * 3) = 1/(24 a₀³)\n\nWait, let me compute that again. Denominator: 2^3 = 8. Then l=1, so l(l + 1/2)(l + 1) = 1*(3/2)*(2) = 3. So denominator is 8*3 = 24. So ⟨1/r³⟩ = 1/(24 a₀³)\n\nNow, the coefficient in the spin-orbit energy is (e²/(8πε₀ m_e² c²)) * ⟨1/r³⟩. Let's compute that. Let's recall that the fine structure constant α = e²/(4πε₀ ℏ c) ≈ 1/137. So e²/(4πε₀) = α ℏ c. Then e²/(8πε₀) = (α ℏ c)/2. So substituting into the coefficient:\n\nCoefficient = (α ℏ c)/(2 m_e² c²) * ⟨1/r³⟩ = (α ℏ)/(2 m_e² c) * ⟨1/r³⟩\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to express this. Alternatively, using known expressions for the fine structure. The fine structure energy shift is given by:\n\nΔE_fs = ( (α² Rydberg) / (n^3 (j + 1/2)) ) )\n\nWait, another approach. The total fine structure splitting between j = l + 1/2 and j = l - 1/2 for a given n and l is given by:\n\nΔE = (α² Rydberg) * (1/(n^3 (l)(l + 1))) )\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recall the exact formula. Let me check. The fine structure energy correction for hydrogen is given by:\n\nE_{n,j} = - (Rydberg) * α² / (2 n^3) * (1/(j + 1/2))\n\nWait, that might be the case. So for each level, the energy depends on j. For example, for the 2p state (n=2, l=1), the possible j values are 3/2 and 1/2. The energy difference between these two would be the spin-orbit splitting.\n\nSo for j=3/2: E = - (Rydberg) * α² / (2 * 8) * (1/(3/2 + 1/2)) ) = - (Rydberg α² / 16) * (1/2) ) = - Rydberg α² / 32\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look up the formula again mentally. The fine structure correction is given by:\n\nE_{fs} = ( (Rydberg) * α² ) / (2 n^3) ) * ( 1/(j + 1/2) - 3/(4 n) )\n\nWait, no, perhaps another formula. Alternatively, the splitting between the j levels for a given n and l is:\n\nΔE = ( (α² Rydberg) / (n^3) ) * ( 1/(l (l + 1)) ) )\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think. The standard formula for the fine structure splitting between two j levels with the same n and l is:\n\nΔE = ( (α² Rydberg) / (n^3) ) * ( 1/(j_1 + 1/2) - 1/(j_2 + 1/2) ) )\n\nBut since j_1 = l + 1/2 and j_2 = l - 1/2, then j_1 + 1/2 = l + 1, and j_2 + 1/2 = l. So the difference would be (1/l - 1/(l + 1)) multiplied by (α² Rydberg)/(n^3). So:\n\nΔE = (α² Rydberg)/(n^3) * (1/l - 1/(l + 1)) ) = (α² Rydberg)/(n^3) * (1/(l(l + 1)) )\n\nFor the 2p state, n=2, l=1. So:\n\nΔE = (α² * 13.6 eV) / (8) * (1/(1*2)) ) = (α² * 13.6 eV) / 16\n\nCompute α²: (1/137)^2 ≈ 1/(18769) ≈ 5.3e-5\n\nSo 5.3e-5 * 13.6 eV ≈ 7.21e-4 eV\n\nDivide by 16: 7.21e-4 /16 ≈ 4.5e-5 eV. That's approximately 4.5e-5 eV, which is 10^-4.5 eV. But the options are 10^-6, 10^-4, 10^-2, 10^0. So 4.5e-5 is closer to 1e-4, which is 10^-4 eV. So the answer should be 10^-4 eV.\n\nWait, but let me check the exact coefficient. The exact formula for the spin-orbit splitting in hydrogen is given by:\n\nΔE = (α² Rydberg) * (1/(n^3 l (l + 1))) )\n\nBut let's compute it step by step. Rydberg constant is approximately 13.6 eV. α ≈ 1/137.\n\nSo α² = (1/137)^2 ≈ 1/18,769 ≈ 5.3e-5.\n\nMultiply by Rydberg: 5.3e-5 * 13.6 eV ≈ 7.21e-4 eV.\n\nNow divide by n^3 l(l+1). For n=2, l=1:\n\nn^3 = 8, l(l+1) = 2.\n\nSo 7.21e-4 eV / (8 * 2) = 7.21e-4 /16 ≈ 4.5e-5 eV ≈ 4.5e-5 eV. Which is 4.5 x 10^-5 eV. That's 0.45 x 10^-4 eV, so approximately 10^-4 eV. Since the options are 10^-6, 10^-4, etc., the closest is 10^-4 eV. Therefore, the answer should be 10^-4 eV.\n</think>\n\nThe spin-orbit splitting in hydrogen's 2p state arises from the fine structure correction due to the interaction between the electron's spin and orbital motion. For a hydrogen atom, the energy splitting \\(\\Delta E\\) between states with total angular momentum \\(j = l + \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(j = l - \\frac{1}{2}\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E = \\frac{\\alpha^2 \\, \\text{Rydberg}}{n^3 \\, l(l+1)},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{137}\\) is the fine-structure constant, \\(\\text{Rydberg} \\approx 13.6 \\, \\text{eV}\\), \\(n = 2\\) (principal quantum number), and \\(l = 1\\) (angular momentum quantum number for the 2p state).\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n\\Delta E = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{137}\\right)^2 \\cdot 13.6}{2^3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1+1)} = \\frac{5.3 \\times 10^{-5} \\cdot 13.6}{8 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{7.21 \\times 10^{-4}}{16} \\approx 4.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}.\n\\]\n\nThis result is closest to \\(10^{-4} \\, \\text{eV}\\) among the given options.

{"id": "atomic/2-1", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to come up with four independent arguments against electrons existing inside the nucleus. Let me start by recalling what I know about electrons and the nucleus. From my basic physics classes, the nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons, which are held together by the strong nuclear force. Electrons, on the other hand, are outside the nucleus in the electron cloud, right? But why can't electrons be inside the nucleus? Let me think of possible reasons.\n\nFirst, there's the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. I remember that this principle states that the more precisely you know the position of a particle, the less precisely you can know its momentum, and vice versa. If an electron were confined within the nucleus, which has a very small radius (on the order of femtometers, 10^-15 meters), the uncertainty in its position would be very small. That would mean a large uncertainty in momentum, leading to a very high kinetic energy. But electrons in the nucleus would need to be bound by the nuclear force, which isn't the case. The strong force acts on protons and neutrons, not electrons. So the energy required to confine an electron would be way higher than what's observed in nuclear binding energies. That's one argument.\n\nSecond, the problem with beta decay. Wait, beta decay involves the emission of an electron from the nucleus. But if electrons were already present in the nucleus, why would they need to be emitted during beta decay? Instead, beta decay is explained by the conversion of a neutron into a proton, electron, and antineutrino. The electron isn't pre-existing in the nucleus but is created during the decay process. So the existence of beta decay suggests that electrons aren't part of the nucleus beforehand.\n\nThird, the size of the nucleus. The de Broglie wavelength of an electron must be comparable to the size of the region it's confined in. The nucleus is much smaller than the typical atomic electron cloud. If electrons were in the nucleus, their wavelength would need to be very short, implying very high energy (since wavelength is inversely proportional to momentum). But electrons in atoms have much lower energies, as seen in atomic energy levels. The energy required for an electron to be confined in the nucleus would be on the order of MeV, which is much higher than the keV energies of atomic electrons. This discrepancy suggests electrons can't be in the nucleus.\n\nFourth, the binding energy and nuclear forces. Electrons interact via the electromagnetic force, but the nucleus is held together by the strong nuclear force. If electrons were inside the nucleus, their electromagnetic interactions would disrupt the binding of protons and neutrons. Since protons are positively charged, having electrons (negative charge) within the nucleus would lead to different binding energies and stability. However, the stability of nuclei is explained without needing electrons inside. Also, the mass of the nucleus would be different if electrons were present, but the mass number accounts for protons and neutrons only. For example, in beta decay, the mass number remains the same because a neutron converts to a proton, and the electron is emitted, not part of the original nucleus.\n\nWait, are these all independent? Let me check. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle argument is about confinement energy. Beta decay is about the creation of electrons rather than their presence. The size/de Broglie wavelength is related to the first but approached from a different angle. The fourth argument is about nuclear forces and binding energy. Yes, these seem independent. Maybe another point could be about the spin-statistics of nuclei. For example, if electrons (which are fermions with spin-1/2) were part of the nucleus, the total spin might not match. But nuclei are composed of protons and neutrons, each spin-1/2, so adding electrons would complicate spin coupling. However, I'm not sure if that's a strong argument. Maybe better to stick with the four I have.\n\nSo summarizing the four arguments:\n\n1. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle leading to impossibly high energy for confined electrons.\n2. Beta decay process where electrons are created, not pre-existing.\n3. De Broglie wavelength and energy mismatch for electrons in the nucleus.\n4. Nuclear binding via strong force and absence of electron involvement in nuclear interactions.\n\nI think these are solid and independent. Let me make sure each is distinct. The first and third are both about energy, but the first uses the uncertainty principle directly, while the third uses the wavelength relation. The second is about a specific nuclear process, and the fourth is about the nature of nuclear forces. Yes, they are separate.\n</think>\n\nHere are four independent arguments against electrons existing inside the nucleus:\n\n1. **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**:  \n   Confining an electron within the nucleus (radius ~1 fm) would result in a large uncertainty in momentum, leading to a kinetic energy on the order of hundreds of MeV. This far exceeds the typical nuclear binding energies (~8 MeV per nucleon), making it impossible for electrons to remain bound in the nucleus.\n\n2. **Beta Decay Mechanism**:  \n   In β⁻ decay, a neutron converts into a proton, electron (β⁻), and antineutrino. The emitted electron is not pre-existing in the nucleus but is created during the decay process. If electrons were already present, their emission would not require this transformation, contradicting experimental observations.\n\n3. **De Broglie Wavelength and Energy Mismatch**:  \n   The de Broglie wavelength of an electron confined to the nucleus (~1 fm) corresponds to a momentum of ~100 MeV/c, implying relativistic energies. Atomic electrons, however, have energies in the keV range, inconsistent with such confinement. This mismatch rules out electrons residing in the nucleus.\n\n4. **Nuclear Force and Binding Energy**:  \n   The nucleus is bound by the strong nuclear force, which acts only on nucleons (protons and neutrons). Electrons interact via the electromagnetic force, and their presence would destabilize the nucleus due to charge interactions with protons. Additionally, nuclear mass calculations account for protons and neutrons only, with no contribution from electrons.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n1.&\\ \\text{Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle} \\\\\n2.&\\ \\text{Beta Decay Mechanism} \\\\\n3.&\\ \\text{De Broglie Wavelength Mismatch} \\\\\n4.&\\ \\text{Nuclear Force Incompatibility}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n1.&\\ \\text{Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle} \\\\\n2.&\\ \\text{Beta Decay Mechanism} \\\\\n3.&\\ \\text{De Broglie Wavelength Mismatch} \\\\\n4.&\\ \\text{Nuclear Force Incompatibility}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n1.&\\ \\text{Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle} \\\\\n2.&\\ \\text{Beta Decay Mechanism} \\\\\n3.&\\ \\text{De Broglie Wavelength Mismatch} \\\\\n4.&\\ \\text{Nuclear Force Incompatibility}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{Nuclei cannot be composed of protons and electrons}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n1.&\\ \\text{Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle} \\\\\n2.&\\ \\text{Beta Decay Mechanism} \\\\\n3.&\\ \\text{De Broglie Wavelength Mismatch} \\\\\n4.&\\ \\text{Nuclear Force Incompatibility}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{Electron cannot be bound in the nucleus}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n1.&\\ \\text{Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle} \\\\\n2.&\\ \\text{Beta Decay Mechanism} \\\\\n3.&\\ \\text{De Broglie Wavelength Mismatch} \\\\\n4.&\\ \\text{Nuclear Force Incompatibility}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{Nuclear magnetic moment does not support electrons in the nucleus}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n1.&\\ \\text{Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle} \\\\\n2.&\\ \\text{Beta Decay Mechanism} \\\\\n3.&\\ \\text{De Broglie Wavelength Mismatch} \\\\\n4.&\\ \\text{Nuclear Force Incompatibility}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{Continuous spectrum contradicts electrons being inside nucleus}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/2-16", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to show that the classical cross section for elastic scattering of point particles from an infinitely massive sphere of radius R is isotropic. Hmm, let me start by recalling what isotropic means here. Isotropic means that the differential cross section doesn't depend on the scattering angle θ; it's the same in all directions. So the cross section is uniform over all angles. \n\nFirst, I should remember the definition of the differential cross section. The differential cross section dσ/dΩ is a measure of the probability of a particle scattering into a given solid angle dΩ. In classical mechanics, for hard sphere scattering, we can probably calculate this by considering the impact parameter and how it relates to the scattering angle. \n\nWait, for a hard sphere, when a point particle scatters off a sphere of radius R, the scattering is determined by the impact parameter b. If the impact parameter is greater than R, the particle doesn't hit the sphere and just goes straight. If b ≤ R, the particle collides with the sphere. Since the sphere is infinitely massive, it won't move, so the collision is elastic, and the particle will bounce off with the same speed but direction determined by the point of contact. \n\nLet me visualize this. The particle comes in with velocity v, impact parameter b. The collision occurs when b ≤ R. The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, right? So the scattering angle θ is related to the angle between the incoming velocity and the normal at the point of contact. \n\nIf I consider the geometry of the collision, the normal vector at the point of contact is radial, pointing from the center of the sphere to the point where the particle hits. The incoming particle's path is along a line with impact parameter b. The angle between the incoming velocity and the normal vector is let's call it α. Then, after collision, the particle reflects such that the angle with the normal is the same. So the scattering angle θ would be related to α. \n\nWait, maybe I can relate the impact parameter b to the scattering angle θ. Let's see. If the sphere has radius R, then the impact parameter b is the perpendicular distance from the center of the sphere to the incoming trajectory. So when the particle hits the sphere, the distance from the center is R, so the impact parameter b is related by b = R sin(α), where α is the angle between the incoming direction and the radial direction at the point of contact. \n\nBut after the collision, the particle reflects off the sphere. Since the sphere is infinitely massive, the collision is specular reflection. The angle between the outgoing velocity and the normal is equal to the angle between the incoming velocity and the normal. So the scattering angle θ is the angle between the incoming and outgoing directions. \n\nLet me draw this. The incoming direction is along some line, hits the sphere at a point where the normal is radial. The incoming angle α is the angle between the velocity and the normal. After reflection, the outgoing angle is also α with respect to the normal, but on the other side. So the total scattering angle θ is 2α. \n\nTherefore, θ = 2α. But we need to relate α to the impact parameter b. From the geometry, the impact parameter b is the distance from the center, so in the right triangle formed by the center, the point of contact, and the closest approach point, we have sin(α) = b/R. Therefore, α = arcsin(b/R). Then θ = 2 arcsin(b/R). \n\nSo solving for b in terms of θ: b = R sin(θ/2). \n\nNow, the differential cross section is given by dσ/dΩ = (b / sinθ) |db/dθ|. Wait, let me recall the formula. In classical scattering, the differential cross section is (dσ/dΩ) = (b / sinθ) |db/dθ|. Let me verify that. \n\nYes, the formula comes from the relation between the impact parameter and the scattering angle. The number of particles scattered into a solid angle dΩ is proportional to the area of the annulus with radius b and thickness db. So dσ = 2πb db, and dΩ = 2π sinθ dθ. Therefore, dσ/dΩ = (b / sinθ) |db/dθ|. \n\nSo substituting b = R sin(θ/2), let's compute db/dθ. \n\nFirst, db/dθ = R * (1/2) cos(θ/2) = (R/2) cos(θ/2). \n\nThen, dσ/dΩ = (b / sinθ) * |db/dθ| = [ R sin(θ/2) / sinθ ] * (R/2 cos(θ/2)) )\n\nSimplify sinθ: sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So substituting that in:\n\n[ R sin(θ/2) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) ] * (R/2 cos(θ/2)) )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nFirst term becomes R / (2 cos(θ/2)), multiplied by R/2 cos(θ/2). \n\nSo (R / (2 cos(θ/2))) * (R/2 cos(θ/2)) ) = R^2 / (4 cos^2(θ/2)) * cos(θ/2) ?\n\nWait, wait, let me check again. Let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, [ R sin(θ/2) / sinθ ] = R sin(θ/2) / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = R / (2 cos(θ/2)).\n\nThen, |db/dθ| = (R/2) cos(θ/2).\n\nMultiply them together: [ R / (2 cos(θ/2)) ] * [ R/2 cos(θ/2) ] = R^2 / (4 cos(θ/2)) * cos(θ/2) ) = R^2 / 4.\n\nSo dσ/dΩ = R^2 / 4.\n\nWait, that's a constant! So the differential cross section is R²/4, which is independent of θ. Therefore, it's isotropic. \n\nTherefore, the cross section is isotropic because dσ/dΩ doesn't depend on the scattering angle θ. \n\nLet me just verify the steps again. \n\n1. Relate impact parameter b to θ: For hard sphere, θ = 2 arcsin(b/R) → b = R sin(θ/2).\n\n2. Compute db/dθ: derivative of R sin(θ/2) with respect to θ is (R/2) cos(θ/2).\n\n3. Then, dσ/dΩ = (b / sinθ) * |db/dθ|.\n\n4. Substitute b and db/dθ: [ R sin(θ/2) / sinθ ] * (R/2 cos(θ/2)).\n\n5. Use sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2): denominator becomes 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).\n\n6. So first term becomes R sin(θ/2) / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = R / (2 cos(θ/2)).\n\n7. Multiply by (R/2 cos(θ/2)) gives R/(2 cosθ/2) * R/2 cosθ/2 = R²/(4 cosθ/2 * cosθ/2) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, [ R/(2 cos(θ/2)) ] * [ R/2 cos(θ/2) ] = (R * R) / (2 * 2) * [1 / cos(θ/2) * cos(θ/2) ] = R²/4 * [1 / cos²(θ/2) * cos(θ/2) ]? Wait, no, the cos(θ/2) in the numerator comes from db/dθ. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the second term is (R/2) cos(θ/2). So when we multiply [ R/(2 cos(θ/2)) ] * [ (R/2) cos(θ/2) ] = R/(2 cosθ/2) * R/2 cosθ/2 = (R^2 / 4) * [ cosθ/2 / cosθ/2 ] = R²/4 * 1 = R²/4. \n\nYes, exactly. The cosθ/2 cancels out. So the result is R²/4, which is a constant. Therefore, dσ/dΩ = R²/4, independent of θ. Hence, the cross section is isotropic. \n\nTherefore, the classical cross section for elastic scattering from a hard sphere is isotropic, with differential cross section equal to R²/4. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me check if there's any mistake in the algebra. The key step is realizing that when you substitute sinθ = 2 sinθ/2 cosθ/2, the terms cancel out, leading to a constant. That makes sense because the scattering angle depends on the impact parameter in such a way that the dependence on θ cancels out in the cross section. So the cross section is the same in all directions, hence isotropic.\n</think>\n\nTo show that the classical cross section for elastic scattering of point particles from an infinitely massive sphere of radius \\( R \\) is isotropic, we analyze the relationship between the impact parameter \\( b \\) and the scattering angle \\( \\theta \\):\n\n1. **Impact Parameter and Scattering Angle**:  \n   For a hard sphere, the scattering angle \\( \\theta \\) is related to the impact parameter \\( b \\) by \\( \\theta = 2 \\arcsin(b/R) \\).

{"id": "atomic/2-29", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to express the energy released in nuclear fission, Q, in terms of the average binding energy per nucleon ε(A) and the mass number A. Then, I have to estimate Q for the symmetric fission of a nucleus with A₀ = 240. Let me start by recalling what each term represents.\n\nFirst, the binding energy of a nucleus is the energy required to split it into its constituent protons and neutrons. The average binding energy per nucleon, ε(A), is just the total binding energy divided by the mass number A. So, the total binding energy for a nucleus with mass number A would be A * ε(A).\n\nNow, the given formula for Q is Q = M₀c² - M₁c² - M₂c². But wait, M₀, M₁, and M₂ are the masses of the parent and daughter nuclei, right? But in terms of binding energy, the mass of a nucleus is related to its binding energy. The actual mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleon masses because of the mass defect, which is equivalent to the binding energy. So, the mass of the nucleus can be written as:\n\nM = Z*m_p + (A - Z)*m_n - B/c²,\n\nwhere Z is the atomic number, m_p and m_n are the proton and neutron masses, and B is the binding energy. But since we're dealing with Q in terms of binding energies, maybe there's a way to express Q using the binding energies of the parent and daughter nuclei.\n\nWait, the formula for Q is the difference in rest mass energy between the parent and the products. If the binding energy is higher for the products, then the total mass of the products would be lower, hence Q would be positive, releasing energy. So, Q is the difference in binding energies between the parent and the daughter nuclei. Let me check that.\n\nThe binding energy B of a nucleus is related to its mass via B = (Z*m_p + (A - Z)*m_n - M)*c². So, rearranging, M*c² = Z*m_p*c² + (A - Z)*m_n*c² - B. Therefore, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is equal to the sum of the rest mass energies of its nucleons minus the binding energy.\n\nSo, substituting into Q:\n\nQ = M₀c² - M₁c² - M₂c²\n\n= [Z₀*m_p*c² + (A₀ - Z₀)*m_n*c² - B₀] - [Z₁*m_p*c² + (A₁ - Z₁)*m_n*c² - B₁] - [Z₂*m_p*c² + (A₂ - Z₂)*m_n*c² - B₂]\n\nBut in fission, the total number of protons and neutrons should be conserved. So, Z₀ = Z₁ + Z₂ and A₀ = A₁ + A₂. Let's substitute that in.\n\nSo, expanding the terms:\n\nQ = [Z₀*m_p*c² + (A₀ - Z₀)*m_n*c² - B₀] - [Z₁*m_p*c² + (A₁ - Z₁)*m_n*c² - B₁] - [Z₂*m_p*c² + (A₂ - Z₂)*m_n*c² - B₂]\n\nGrouping the terms:\n\n= Z₀*m_p*c² - Z₁*m_p*c² - Z₂*m_p*c² + (A₀ - Z₀)*m_n*c² - (A₁ - Z₁)*m_n*c² - (A₂ - Z₂)*m_n*c² - B₀ + B₁ + B₂\n\nSince Z₀ = Z₁ + Z₂ and A₀ = A₁ + A₂, let's substitute:\n\nFor the proton terms:\n\nZ₀*m_p*c² - (Z₁ + Z₂)*m_p*c² = 0\n\nFor the neutron terms:\n\n(A₀ - Z₀)*m_n*c² - [(A₁ - Z₁) + (A₂ - Z₂)]*m_n*c²\n\n= (A₀ - Z₀)*m_n*c² - [A₁ + A₂ - Z₁ - Z₂]*m_n*c²\n\nBut A₁ + A₂ = A₀ and Z₁ + Z₂ = Z₀, so:\n\n= (A₀ - Z₀)*m_n*c² - [A₀ - Z₀]*m_n*c² = 0\n\nSo all the terms involving m_p and m_n cancel out. Therefore, Q simplifies to:\n\nQ = -B₀ + B₁ + B₂\n\nWhich is the same as Q = (B₁ + B₂) - B₀\n\nSo, the energy released is the difference between the total binding energy of the products and the binding energy of the parent nucleus.\n\nBut the problem asks to express Q in terms of ε(A) and A. Since ε(A) is the binding energy per nucleon, then B = A * ε(A). Therefore:\n\nQ = (A₁*ε(A₁) + A₂*ε(A₂)) - A₀*ε(A₀)\n\nSo, Q = A₁ε(A₁) + A₂ε(A₂) - A₀ε(A₀)\n\nThat's the expression. Now, for symmetric fission, the parent nucleus splits into two equal fragments. So, A₁ = A₂ = A₀ / 2. Since A₀ is 240, then each daughter nucleus has A = 120.\n\nTherefore, substituting into Q:\n\nQ = 2*(A₀/2)*ε(A₀/2) - A₀*ε(A₀) = A₀[ε(120) - ε(240)]\n\nSo, Q = A₀ [ ε(A₀/2) - ε(A₀) ]\n\nNow, to estimate Q, I need to know the values of ε(120) and ε(240). Looking at the typical binding energy per nucleon curve, which peaks around iron (A ~ 56). For heavy nuclei like uranium (A ~ 238), the binding energy per nucleon is around 7.5 MeV. When they split into two medium-mass nuclei, say around A ~ 120, the binding energy per nucleon increases because those medium nuclei are closer to the peak. For example, for A ~ 120 (like tin or something), ε might be around 8.5 MeV. Let me check approximate values.\n\nWait, the binding energy per nucleon for U-238 is approximately 7.6 MeV. For a nucleus with A ~ 120, like, say, Xe-136 (but that's A=136), but maybe around A=120, the binding energy per nucleon is about 8.3 MeV. The exact numbers might vary, but the idea is that ε(A) increases when going from heavy nuclei (A ~ 240) to medium nuclei (A ~ 120). So, the difference ε(120) - ε(240) would be approximately 8.5 - 7.5 = 1.0 MeV per nucleon. Then, multiplying by A₀ = 240, gives Q ≈ 240 * 1.0 MeV = 240 MeV.\n\nBut let me think again. If the parent nucleus has A₀ = 240, and splits into two A=120, then each daughter has A=120. The binding energy per nucleon for A=240 (like a heavy nucleus) is lower than for A=120. So, the total binding energy of the daughters is higher than that of the parent. Therefore, the energy released Q is positive.\n\nAssuming ε(240) ≈ 7.5 MeV/nucleon and ε(120) ≈ 8.5 MeV/nucleon. Then, the difference per nucleon is 1.0 MeV. For 240 nucleons, that's 240 * 1.0 MeV = 240 MeV. So, Q ≈ 240 MeV.\n\nBut maybe the actual values are a bit different. For example, the binding energy per nucleon for uranium-238 is about 7.6 MeV. For a nucleus with A=120, maybe it's around 8.5 MeV. So, the difference is 0.9 MeV. Then, Q = 240 * 0.9 ≈ 216 MeV. But perhaps the problem expects an approximate value. Since the figure is given as Figure 2.5, but since I don't have the figure, I need to use typical values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the binding energy per nucleon at A=240 is about 7.6 MeV, and at A=120, it's about 8.5 MeV. Then, the difference is 0.9 MeV per nucleon. So, Q = 240*(8.5 -7.6) = 240*0.9 = 216 MeV. But sometimes, the increase is considered about 0.8 MeV, leading to Q ≈ 200 MeV. However, in reality, the energy released in a typical uranium-235 fission is around 200 MeV. But this is symmetric fission of A=240, which might be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the binding energy per nucleon for A=240 is 7.5 MeV, and for A=120, it's 8.5 MeV. Then, Q=240*(8.5-7.5)=240 MeV. But maybe the actual increase is about 1 MeV, leading to 240 MeV. However, I think the standard value for a typical uranium fission is around 200 MeV, but that's for U-235. Since the problem is about A=240, which is even heavier, maybe the Q is larger. But without the exact binding energy curve, it's an estimate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the binding energy per nucleon for A=240 is 7.6 MeV, and for A=120, it's 8.4 MeV. Then, difference is 0.8 MeV, so Q=240*0.8=192 MeV. But perhaps the answer is expected to be around 200 MeV. Let me check some references.\n\nWait, in reality, the binding energy per nucleon for heavy nuclei (like U-238) is about 7.5-7.6 MeV. For medium nuclei around A=120, it's about 8.4-8.5 MeV. So, the difference is approximately 0.9-1.0 MeV per nucleon. Therefore, for A₀=240, Q=240*(0.9)=216 MeV. But maybe the problem expects rounding to 200 MeV. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 180 MeV. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the binding energy per nucleon for A=240 is 7.5 MeV, and for A=120, 8.5 MeV. Then, the difference is 1.0 MeV, so Q=240*1.0=240 MeV. But I think in reality, the increase is less. Let me check approximate values.\n\nLooking up a binding energy per nucleon curve, the maximum is around Fe-56 at about 8.8 MeV. For U-238, it's about 7.6 MeV. For a nucleus like Ba-138 (A=138), it's around 8.3 MeV. For A=120, maybe around 8.4 MeV. So, the difference would be 8.4 -7.6=0.8 MeV. Then, Q=240*0.8=192 MeV. But again, this is an approximation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses a linear approximation of the binding energy curve. For example, the curve is roughly parabolic around the peak. But since we're dealing with heavy nuclei splitting into medium, the increase in binding energy per nucleon is about 0.8-1.0 MeV.\n\nGiven that, the answer is likely around 200 MeV. But since the problem says to estimate, perhaps using 1.0 MeV per nucleon difference, leading to 240 MeV. However, I need to check if there's a standard value for this.\n\nWait, in the case of U-235 fission, the energy released is about 200 MeV per fission. But U-235 has A=235, and splits into two nuclei with A around 95 and 135, which are not symmetric. Symmetric fission might release a bit more energy. But since the problem is about A=240 splitting into two A=120, which is symmetric, the energy released might be higher. However, the binding energy per nucleon for symmetric fragments (A=120) would be higher than asymmetric ones? Wait, actually, the binding energy per nucleon peaks around A=56, so symmetric fission of a heavy nucleus would produce fragments that are still heavier than the peak, but closer to the peak than the original nucleus. So, the increase in binding energy per nucleon would be from, say, 7.5 MeV to 8.5 MeV, giving a difference of 1.0 MeV, so 240*1=240 MeV.\n\nBut I think the standard answer for such a question, when not given the exact curve, is to take the difference as approximately 1 MeV per nucleon, leading to Q≈240 MeV. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the use of the semi-empirical mass formula to calculate ε(A), but that would be more involved.\n\nAlternatively, using the semi-empirical mass formula (Bethe-Weizsäcker formula), the binding energy per nucleon can be approximated. The formula is:\n\nB(A,Z)/A = a_V - a_S/A^{1/3} - a_C Z²/A^{4/3} - a_A (A-2Z)²/(A²) + δ(A)/A,\n\nwhere a_V ≈ 15.5 MeV, a_S ≈ 17.8 MeV, a_C ≈ 0.71 MeV, a_A ≈ 23.7 MeV, and δ(A) is the pairing term.\n\nBut this might be too complicated, but maybe we can approximate ε(A) = B/A ≈ a_V - a_S/A^{1/3} - a_C Z²/A^{4/3} - a_A (A-2Z)²/(A²).\n\nAssuming that for heavy nuclei, the dominant terms are the volume term, surface term, and Coulomb term. The asymmetry term (a_A) is also important, but for a rough estimate, maybe we can approximate.\n\nAssuming the parent nucleus is A₀=240. Let's assume it's uranium, so Z₀=92. Then, for symmetric fission, each daughter has A=120 and Z=46 (since 92/2=46). Let's compute ε(A) for A=240 and A=120.\n\nFor A=240, Z=92:\n\nε(240) ≈ a_V - a_S/(240)^{1/3} - a_C*(92)²/(240)^{4/3} - a_A*(240 - 2*92)²/(240²)\n\nCompute each term:\n\na_V =15.5\n\na_S/A^{1/3}=17.8/(240^{1/3})≈17.8/6.2≈2.87\n\na_C*Z²/A^{4/3}=0.71*(92²)/(240^{4/3})\n\nFirst compute 92²=8464\n\n240^{4/3}= (240^{1/3})^4 ≈6.2^4≈6.2*6.2=38.44*6.2≈238.3*6.2≈1477.46\n\nSo, 0.71*8464/1477.46≈0.71*5.73≈4.07\n\na_A*(A-2Z)^2/A²=23.7*(240-184)^2/(240^2)=23.7*(56)^2/(57600)=23.7*3136/57600≈23.7*0.0544≈1.29\n\nSo, ε(240)=15.5 -2.87 -4.07 -1.29≈15.5 -8.23≈7.27 MeV\n\nNow for A=120, Z=46:\n\nε(120)=a_V -a_S/(120)^{1/3} -a_C*(46)^2/(120)^{4/3} -a_A*(120 -2*46)^2/(120)^2 + δ(120)/120\n\nAssuming δ(120)=0 (since 120 is even-even? If Z=46 and N=74, both even, so δ=+12/sqrt(120)≈12/10.95≈1.1 MeV, but δ/A would be 1.1/120≈0.009 MeV, negligible. So ignore δ.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na_V=15.5\n\na_S/A^{1/3}=17.8/(120^{1/3})≈17.8/4.93≈3.61\n\na_C*Z²/A^{4/3}=0.71*(46²)/(120^{4/3})\n\n46²=2116\n\n120^{4/3}= (120^{1/3})^4≈4.93^4≈4.93*4.93=24.3*4.93≈24.3*5=121.5 -24.3*0.07≈121.5-1.7≈119.8\n\nSo, 0.71*2116/119.8≈0.71*17.66≈12.54\n\nWait, that seems high. Wait, 2116 divided by 119.8≈17.66. Then 0.71*17.66≈12.54 MeV? That can't be right. Wait, the Coulomb term is subtracted, so this would be a large subtraction. But maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, 120^{4/3}= (120)^(1) * (120)^(1/3)=120 * 4.93≈590. So, 120^{4/3}=120^(1 +1/3)=120 * 120^{1/3}≈120*4.93≈591.6. Therefore, 46²=2116, so 0.71*2116/591.6≈0.71*3.577≈2.54 MeV.\n\nAh, I think I messed up the exponent. The Coulomb term is a_C * Z²/A^{4/3}. So, A^{4/3}=120^(4/3)= (120^(1/3))^4= (4.93)^4≈4.93*4.93=24.3, 24.3*4.93≈119.8. So, A^{4/3}=119.8. Therefore, Z²/A^{4/3}=2116/119.8≈17.66. Then, a_C * that=0.71*17.66≈12.54. Wait, that's still high. But that would make the Coulomb term 12.54 MeV, which is subtracted. But that can't be right because the Coulomb term for A=120 should be smaller than for A=240. Wait, for A=240, the Coulomb term was 4.07 MeV. For A=120, Z=46, it's 0.71*(46²)/(120^{4/3})=0.71*(2116)/119.8≈0.71*17.66≈12.54. That seems too large. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, the Coulomb term in the binding energy formula is a_C * Z²/A^{1/3}, not A^{4/3}. Wait, let me check the semi-empirical formula again. The Coulomb term is a_C * Z(Z-1)/A^{1/3}. But sometimes approximated as a_C * Z²/A^{1/3}. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent.\n\nYes! The Coulomb term is a_C * Z²/A^{1/3}, not A^{4/3}. So, I messed up the exponent. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, for the Coulomb term:\n\nFor A=240, Z=92:\n\na_C * Z²/A^{1/3} =0.71*(92²)/240^{1/3}\n\n92²=8464\n\n240^{1/3}≈6.2\n\nSo, 0.71*8464/6.2≈0.71*1365≈969.15, but this is in the formula for B/A, so divided by A=240.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the formula for B/A is:\n\nB/A = a_V - a_S/A^{1/3} - a_C Z²/A^{4/3} - a_A (A-2Z)^2/A² + δ/A\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me check the correct form of the semi-empirical mass formula.\n\nThe binding energy B is given by:\n\nB = a_V A - a_S A^{2/3} - a_C Z²/A^{1/3} - a_A (A-2Z)²/A + δ\n\nTherefore, the binding energy per nucleon is:\n\nB/A = a_V - a_S/A^{1/3} - a_C Z²/A^{4/3} - a_A (A-2Z)²/A² + δ/A\n\nYes, so the Coulomb term is a_C * Z² / A^{4/3}, which is correct. So, for A=240, Z=92:\n\nCoulomb term per nucleon = 0.71 * (92)^2 / (240)^{4/3}\n\nSimilarly for A=120, Z=46:\n\nCoulomb term per nucleon =0.71*(46)^2/(120)^{4/3}\n\nSo, let's recalculate.\n\nFor A=240, Z=92:\n\nCompute 240^{4/3}= (240^{1/3})^4≈6.2^4≈6.2*6.2=38.44, 38.44*6.2≈238.3, 238.3*6.2≈1477.46\n\nSo, 92²=8464\n\nSo, Coulomb term per nucleon=0.71*8464/1477.46≈0.71*5.73≈4.07 MeV\n\nFor A=120, Z=46:\n\n120^{4/3}= (120^{1/3})^4≈4.93^4≈4.93*4.93=24.3, 24.3*4.93≈119.8, 119.8*4.93≈590.5 (Wait, no: 120^{4/3}=120^(1 +1/3)=120 * 120^{1/3}=120*4.93≈591.6)\n\nSo, 46²=2116\n\nCoulomb term per nucleon=0.71*2116/591.6≈0.71*3.577≈2.54 MeV\n\nSo, the Coulomb term per nucleon decreases from 4.07 MeV in the parent to 2.54 MeV in the daughters. That makes sense because the Coulomb repulsion is lower in the smaller nuclei.\n\nNow, the surface term per nucleon for A=240:\n\na_S/A^{1/3}=17.8/6.2≈2.87 MeV\n\nFor A=120:\n\na_S/A^{1/3}=17.8/4.93≈3.61 MeV\n\nThe surface term increases because the surface area to volume ratio is higher for smaller nuclei.\n\nThe asymmetry term for A=240:\n\na_A*(A-2Z)^2/A²=23.7*(240-184)^2/(240)^2=23.7*(56)^2/57600=23.7*3136/57600≈23.7*0.0544≈1.29 MeV\n\nFor A=120, Z=46:\n\na_A*(120-92)^2/(120)^2=23.7*(28)^2/14400=23.7*784/14400≈23.7*0.0544≈1.29 MeV\n\nWait, same asymmetry term? Let's compute:\n\nA-2Z=120-92=28\n\nSo, (28)^2=784\n\nA²=14400\n\nSo, 784/14400≈0.0544\n\nThus, 23.7*0.0544≈1.29 MeV\n\nSo, the asymmetry term is the same for both parent and daughters? Interesting.\n\nNow, putting it all together for ε(240):\n\nε(240)=15.5 (volume) -2.87 (surface) -4.07 (Coulomb) -1.29 (asymmetry) ≈15.5 -8.23≈7.27 MeV\n\nFor ε(120):\n\nε(120)=15.5 -3.61 (surface) -2.54 (Coulomb) -1.29 (asymmetry) ≈15.5 -7.44≈8.06 MeV\n\nSo, the difference ε(120) - ε(240)=8.06 -7.27=0.79 MeV per nucleon\n\nTherefore, Q=240*0.79≈189.6 MeV≈190 MeV\n\nBut this is using the semi-empirical formula. However, in reality, the binding energy per nucleon for A=120 might be higher. For example, for tin-120 (Z=50), which is a doubly magic nucleus, the binding energy per nucleon is higher. Wait, but Z=46 is not magic. However, the semi-empirical formula doesn't account for shell effects, so the actual ε(A) might be higher. For example, if ε(120) is 8.5 MeV, then the difference would be 1.23 MeV, leading to Q=240*1.23≈295 MeV. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, using the semi-empirical calculation, we get Q≈190 MeV. But since the problem says to estimate, and given that typical fission Q values are around 200 MeV, the answer is likely approximately 200 MeV. However, based on the semi-empirical calculation, it's about 190 MeV. But maybe the problem expects using approximate values from the binding energy curve, leading to around 200 MeV.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is approximately 200 MeV. But to be precise based on the semi-empirical formula, it's about 190 MeV. However, since the problem says to estimate, and given that the binding energy per nucleon difference is roughly 0.8 MeV, leading to Q≈240*0.8≈192 MeV, which rounds to about 200 MeV.\n\nBut the question might expect the student to look at the curve and see that the average binding energy per nucleon increases by about 0.8-1.0 MeV, leading to Q≈200 MeV. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nTo express the energy released \\( Q \\) in terms of the average binding energy per nucleon \\( \\varepsilon(A) \\) and mass number \\( A \\), we start with the relationship between binding energy \\( B \\) and \\( \\varepsilon(A) \\):  \n\\[ B = A \\cdot \\varepsilon(A). \\]  \nThe energy released in fission is the difference in total binding energy between the parent and daughter nuclei:  \n\\[ Q = B_1 + B_2 - B_0 = A_1 \\varepsilon(A_1) + A_2 \\varepsilon(A_2) - A_0 \\varepsilon(A_0). \\]  \n\nFor **symmetric fission** of \\( A_0 = 240 \\), the parent splits into two nuclei with \\( A_1 = A_2 = 120 \\). Substituting into the formula:  \n\\[ Q = 2 \\cdot 120 \\cdot \\varepsilon(120) - 240 \\cdot \\varepsilon(240) = 240 \\left[ \\varepsilon(120) - \\varepsilon(240) \\right]. \\]  \n\nUsing typical values from the binding energy curve:  \n- \\( \\varepsilon(240) \\approx 7.5 \\, \\text{MeV/nucleon} \\) (for heavy nuclei like uranium),  \n- \\( \\varepsilon(120) \\approx 8.5 \\, \\text{MeV/nucleon} \\) (for medium-mass nuclei closer to the peak).  \n\nThe difference is \\( \\Delta \\varepsilon = 8.5 - 7.5 = 1.0 \\, \\text{MeV/nucleon} \\).

{"id": "atomic/2-11", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the excitation energy of the lowest T=6 isospin state in ^90Zr. Hmm, let's start by recalling what excitation energy means. It's the energy difference between an excited state and the ground state of a nucleus. But here, they mention an isospin state with T=6. Isospin is a concept in nuclear physics where protons and neutrons are considered as two states of the same particle, differing in their isospin projection. The total isospin T is related to the difference between the number of neutrons and protons. Wait, the formula for T is (N-Z)/2, right? So for ^90Zr, which has Z=40 and N=50, T would be (50-40)/2 = 5. But the question is about a state with T=6. That means this state has a higher isospin than the ground state. How does that happen? Maybe by promoting nucleons to higher isospin states, but I'm not sure.\n\nThe problem gives the binding energies of ^90Zr and ^90Y. Wait, ^90Y has Z=39 and N=51, so its T would be (51-39)/2 = 6. Oh! So the ground state of ^90Y has T=6. But ^90Zr has T=5 in its ground state. So maybe the T=6 state in ^90Zr is an isobaric analog state of the ^90Y ground state. Is that right? Because isobaric analog states are states in different nuclei (same A, different Z) that are related by isospin symmetry. So the ground state of ^90Y (T=6) would have an analog state in ^90Zr at some excitation energy. That makes sense.\n\nSo to find the excitation energy, I need to calculate the energy difference between the T=6 state in Zr and its ground state. Since the analog state in Y is the ground state, the energy difference should be related to the difference in binding energies of the two nuclei, adjusted for Coulomb energy differences and other effects. Wait, but how exactly?\n\nThe formula I remember for the excitation energy of the isobaric analog state (IAS) is E_excitation ≈ ΔB + ΔCoulomb. Where ΔB is the difference in binding energies between the two nuclei, and ΔCoulomb is the difference in Coulomb energy. But I need to think carefully here.\n\nThe IAS in Zr (the T=6 state) corresponds to the ground state of Y. So the energy difference between the two should be the difference in their binding energies plus the Coulomb displacement energy. Wait, but the binding energy of Zr is higher than Y. Let me check the numbers: Zr has BE 783.916 MeV, Y has 782.410 MeV. So Zr is more bound by 1.506 MeV. But the IAS in Zr would be higher in energy than the ground state of Y because of the Coulomb repulsion. Hmm, maybe I need to reverse the difference.\n\nWait, the Coulomb energy in a nucleus is given by (3/5)(Z^2 e^2)/(4πε0 R), where R is the nuclear radius. For two nuclei with the same A but different Z, the Coulomb energy difference would be (3/5)(e^2/(4πε0 R))(Z1^2 - Z2^2). Since Zr has Z=40 and Y has Z=39, the Coulomb energy for Zr is higher. So the Coulomb energy difference would be (3/5)(e^2/(4πε0 R))(40² - 39²). Let's compute that. 40² - 39² = (40-39)(40+39) = 1*79 = 79. So the Coulomb energy difference is (3/5)(e²/(4πε0 R))*79. But what's the value of (e²/(4πε0 R))? The Coulomb energy constant for a nucleus is approximately 0.72 MeV per proton pair. Wait, the Coulomb energy for a nucleus is approximately a_c * Z²/A^(1/3), where a_c is the Coulomb term in the semi-empirical mass formula, which is about 0.72 MeV. So the Coulomb energy for a nucleus is approximately 0.72 * Z² / A^(1/3). Therefore, the difference in Coulomb energy between Zr and Y would be 0.72*(40² - 39²)/90^(1/3). Let's compute that. 40² -39²=79 as before. So 0.72*79 / 90^(1/3). 90^(1/3) is approximately 4.48 since 4^3=64 and 5^3=125. Let me calculate it more accurately. 4.48^3 = 4.48*4.48=20.07, 20.07*4.48≈90. So 90^(1/3)≈4.48. Then 0.72*79 /4.48 ≈ (56.88)/4.48 ≈12.7 MeV. So the Coulomb energy difference is about 12.7 MeV. But wait, Zr has higher Z, so its Coulomb energy is higher. Therefore, the IAS in Zr (which is the analog of Y's ground state) should be higher in energy than Y's ground state by the Coulomb energy difference. But how does this relate to the excitation energy?\n\nAlternatively, the excitation energy of the IAS in Zr would be the difference in binding energies plus the Coulomb energy difference. Wait, let's think. The binding energy of Zr is higher than Y by 1.506 MeV. But the IAS in Zr is less bound than the ground state of Zr because it's an excited state. So the excitation energy would be the difference in binding energies (since Y is less bound) plus the Coulomb energy shift. Wait, maybe the formula is E_ex = (BE_Y - BE_Zr) + ΔCoulomb. But BE_Y is less than BE_Zr, so BE_Y - BE_Zr is negative. Let me check.\n\nWait, the binding energy of Zr is 783.916 MeV, and Y is 782.410 MeV. So Zr is more bound by 1.506 MeV. If the IAS in Zr is the analog of Y's ground state, then the energy of the IAS in Zr would be higher than the ground state of Y by the Coulomb energy difference. But how does that translate to the excitation energy in Zr?\n\nAlternatively, the energy difference between the two nuclei (Zr and Y) in their respective states (Zr in excited IAS, Y in ground state) would be due to the Coulomb energy and the difference in binding energy. Let me model this.\n\nThe ground state of Y has T=6. The IAS in Zr is a state with the same isospin quantum numbers as Y's ground state, but in Zr. The energy of the IAS in Zr relative to Zr's ground state is the excitation energy we need. To compute this, we can consider that the IAS in Zr is related to Y's ground state by an isospin rotation. Therefore, the energy difference between these two states should be due to the difference in Coulomb energy and the difference in binding energy.\n\nWait, the binding energy difference between Zr and Y is 783.916 - 782.410 = 1.506 MeV. But Zr is more bound. However, the IAS in Zr is higher in energy than Zr's ground state. So the excitation energy E_ex should be the energy required to \"convert\" Y's ground state into Zr's IAS. That would involve the Coulomb energy difference and the binding energy difference.\n\nAlternatively, the formula might be E_ex = (M_Y - M_Zr) * c² + ΔCoulomb. But I need to be careful with the signs. Let's think in terms of mass. The mass of Y is higher than Zr because it's less bound. The mass difference (M_Y - M_Zr) would be (BE_Zr - BE_Y)/c². Since BE is the energy that holds the nucleus together, a higher BE means lower mass. So M_Y = M_Zr + (BE_Zr - BE_Y)/c². But when you create the IAS in Zr, which is like Y's ground state but in Zr, you have to account for the Coulomb energy. So the excitation energy would be the mass difference plus the Coulomb energy difference.\n\nWait, maybe the excitation energy is given by the difference in binding energies plus the Coulomb energy difference. Let me try to write it out.\n\nThe binding energy of Zr (ground state) is higher than Y by 1.506 MeV. So if the IAS in Zr is analogous to Y's ground state, then the energy required to excite Zr to that state would be the difference in binding energies (since Zr is more bound, you need to add energy to reach a less bound state) plus the Coulomb energy difference (since Zr has higher Z, the Coulomb energy is higher, so the IAS in Zr would have higher Coulomb energy than Y's ground state). Wait, but the Coulomb energy is part of the binding energy. So maybe the Coulomb energy difference is already accounted for in the binding energy difference. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the excitation energy of the IAS can be estimated using the formula:\n\nE_ex = [M(Y) - M(Zr)]c² + ΔE_Coulomb\n\nBut M(Y)c² = (Zm_p + Nm_n - BE_Y)\n\nSimilarly, M(Zr)c² = (Z'm_p + N'm_n - BE_Zr)\n\nBut since Y and Zr are isobars (same A=90), but different Z and N. For Y: Z=39, N=51. For Zr: Z=40, N=50. So the mass difference is:\n\nM(Y) - M(Zr) = [39m_p +51m_n - BE_Y/c²] - [40m_p +50m_n - BE_Zr/c²]\n\n= (-m_p + m_n) + (BE_Zr - BE_Y)/c²\n\nBut m_n - m_p ≈ 1.293 MeV/c². So:\n\n[M(Y) - M(Zr)]c² = (-m_p + m_n)c² + (BE_Zr - BE_Y)\n\n≈ 1.293 MeV + (783.916 - 782.410) MeV\n\n= 1.293 + 1.506 ≈ 2.799 MeV\n\nBut this is the mass difference between Y and Zr. However, the IAS in Zr is supposed to be the state that is the isospin analog of Y's ground state. So the energy of this state relative to Zr's ground state would be the mass difference (since Y is heavier, its ground state is higher in mass) plus the Coulomb displacement energy.\n\nWait, but the Coulomb displacement energy is the energy required to account for the difference in Coulomb energy between the two nuclei. So the formula for the excitation energy is:\n\nE_ex = [M(Y) - M(Zr)]c² + ΔE_Coulomb\n\nBut we already calculated [M(Y) - M(Zr)]c² ≈ 2.799 MeV. Then ΔE_Coulomb is the difference in Coulomb energy between the two nuclei. Wait, but the Coulomb energy in Zr is higher than in Y. So when you form the IAS in Zr (which is like Y's state), you have to add the extra Coulomb energy. So ΔE_Coulomb = E_Coulomb(Zr) - E_Coulomb(Y)\n\nThe Coulomb energy for a nucleus is a_c * Z² / A^(1/3), where a_c ≈ 0.72 MeV.\n\nSo for Zr (Z=40):\n\nE_Coulomb(Zr) = 0.72 * 40² / (90)^(1/3)\n\nFor Y (Z=39):\n\nE_Coulomb(Y) = 0.72 * 39² / (90)^(1/3)\n\nSo ΔE_Coulomb = 0.72*(40² -39²)/90^(1/3) = 0.72*(79)/4.481 ≈ (0.72*79)/4.481 ≈ 56.88/4.481 ≈12.7 MeV\n\nSo the total excitation energy would be E_ex ≈ 2.799 MeV +12.7 MeV ≈15.5 MeV\n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me check the steps again.\n\nFirst, the mass difference [M(Y) - M(Zr)]c² is approximately 2.8 MeV. Then the Coulomb energy difference is about 12.7 MeV. So adding them gives 15.5 MeV. But is this the correct approach?\n\nAlternatively, some sources say that the excitation energy of the IAS is given by the Coulomb displacement energy, which is approximately ΔE_C = 1.444*(Z+1)/A^(1/3) - 0.45 MeV. Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe another approach.\n\nWait, another way to think: The energy difference between the analog states in two isobars is mainly due to the Coulomb energy difference. So the excitation energy in Zr would be approximately equal to the Coulomb energy difference between Zr and Y. But we calculated that as 12.7 MeV. However, the mass difference was 2.8 MeV. So why are we adding them?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is E_ex = (BE_Y - BE_Zr) + ΔE_Coulomb\n\nBut BE_Y is less than BE_Zr, so BE_Y - BE_Zr is negative. Let's compute:\n\nBE_Y - BE_Zr = 782.410 -783.916 = -1.506 MeV\n\nΔE_Coulomb =12.7 MeV\n\nSo E_ex = -1.506 +12.7 ≈11.2 MeV\n\nBut this doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the excitation energy is the difference in the Coulomb energies minus the binding energy difference. Because the binding energy of Zr is higher, meaning it's more bound, so to get to the excited state (which is less bound), you need to add the difference in binding energies (since Zr is more bound) and the Coulomb energy difference.\n\nAlternatively, the excitation energy should be the energy required to raise the nucleus from its ground state to the IAS. The IAS is less bound than the ground state, so the excitation energy is the difference in binding energy plus the Coulomb energy shift.\n\nWait, let's think of it this way: The ground state of Y has a certain energy. The IAS in Zr is the same state (in terms of isospin) but in Zr. The energy difference between these two states is due to the Coulomb energy difference. But since Y is less bound than Zr, the IAS in Zr should be higher in energy than the ground state of Zr by the Coulomb energy difference minus the binding energy difference. Or maybe plus?\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Let me look for a standard formula or approach for calculating the excitation energy of an isobaric analog state.\n\nFrom what I recall, the excitation energy of the IAS in the parent nucleus (here, Zr) can be estimated using the Coulomb displacement energy formula. The Coulomb displacement energy (ΔE_C) between two isobars is given by:\n\nΔE_C ≈ (e²/(4πε0)) * (Z1² - Z2²)/(2R)\n\nWhere R is the nuclear radius, approximately R = r0 A^(1/3), with r0 ≈1.2 fm.\n\nBut perhaps using the semi-empirical mass formula's Coulomb term, which is a_c * Z²/A^(1/3), so the difference would be a_c*(Z1² - Z2²)/A^(1/3)\n\nGiven that a_c is 0.72 MeV, then:\n\nΔE_C = 0.72*(40² -39²)/90^(1/3) ≈0.72*79/4.48≈12.7 MeV\n\nBut then, the excitation energy should also account for the mass difference between the two nuclei. Wait, the Q-value for the beta decay between Y and Zr might be related. But Y has Z=39, so it can beta decay to Zr-90 (Z=40). The Q-value would be the difference in binding energies plus the mass difference between neutron and proton.\n\nWait, the Q-value for β− decay of Y to Zr is:\n\nQ = [M(Y) - M(Zr)]c² = (BE_Zr - BE_Y) + (m_n - m_p)c²\n\nWhich we calculated earlier as approximately 1.506 MeV +1.293 MeV≈2.799 MeV\n\nBut how does this relate to the excitation energy?\n\nThe IAS in Zr is the state that is related to the Y ground state via isospin symmetry. Therefore, the energy of the IAS in Zr should be higher than the Y ground state by the Coulomb displacement energy. But since Y is the lower Z nucleus, its Coulomb energy is lower. So the energy of the IAS in Zr would be the energy of Y's ground state plus the Coulomb energy difference. Then, the excitation energy in Zr is this energy minus the ground state energy of Zr.\n\nAlternatively, the excitation energy E_ex is equal to the Coulomb displacement energy ΔE_C minus the Q-value of the beta decay.\n\nWait, let's try to model this.\n\nThe ground state energy of Y is E_Y = -BE_Y\n\nThe ground state energy of Zr is E_Zr = -BE_Zr\n\nThe IAS in Zr has energy E_IAS = E_Y + ΔE_C\n\nTherefore, the excitation energy is E_ex = E_IAS - E_Zr = (E_Y + ΔE_C) - E_Zr = (-BE_Y + ΔE_C) - (-BE_Zr) = (BE_Zr - BE_Y) + ΔE_C\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nBE_Zr - BE_Y = 1.506 MeV\n\nΔE_C =12.7 MeV\n\nSo E_ex =1.506 +12.7 ≈14.2 MeV\n\nBut earlier when we calculated [M(Y)-M(Zr)]c² ≈2.8 MeV, which is BE_Zr - BE_Y + (m_n -m_p)c² ≈1.506 +1.293≈2.799 MeV. So perhaps there's a missing term here.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula includes both the Coulomb energy difference and the mass difference. Let me check a reference approach.\n\nAccording to some nuclear physics references, the excitation energy of the isobaric analog state can be estimated using the formula:\n\nE_ex ≈ ΔM c² + ΔE_Coulomb\n\nWhere ΔM is the mass difference between the two isobars. But ΔM c² is [M(Y) - M(Zr)]c² ≈2.799 MeV as calculated before, and ΔE_Coulomb≈12.7 MeV. Then E_ex≈2.799 +12.7≈15.5 MeV. But this seems high.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: The Coulomb displacement energy between two isobars is given by ΔE_C = (e²/(4πε0)) * (Z_1^2 - Z_2^2)/(2R), where R is the nuclear radius. Let's compute this.\n\ne²/(4πε0) ≈1.44 MeV·fm\n\nR = r0 A^(1/3) =1.2 fm *90^(1/3)≈1.2*4.48≈5.376 fm\n\nThen ΔE_C =1.44*(40² -39²)/(2*5.376) =1.44*79/(10.752)≈(113.76)/(10.752)≈10.58 MeV\n\nSo approximately 10.6 MeV. Then adding the mass difference [M(Y)-M(Zr)]c²≈2.8 MeV gives E_ex≈10.6+2.8≈13.4 MeV\n\nBut this is different from the previous calculation using the semi-empirical formula. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, some sources state that the excitation energy of the IAS is approximately given by the Coulomb displacement energy, which can be estimated as ΔE_C ≈ 1.44 * (Z+0.5)/A^(1/3) MeV. For Zr (Z=40), this would be 1.44*(40+0.5)/4.48≈1.44*40.5/4.48≈(58.32)/4.48≈13.0 MeV. But this is just a rough estimate. However, this doesn't account for the mass difference.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"estimate the excitation energy\", so maybe there's a simpler way. Since the ground state of ^90Y has T=6, and the IAS in ^90Zr is the same state (T=6), the excitation energy should be approximately the difference in binding energies plus the Coulomb energy difference. But how?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the IAS in Zr is the state where one proton is converted into a neutron compared to the ground state of Y. Wait, no. Y has Z=39, N=51. Zr has Z=40, N=50. So to get from Y to Zr, you convert a neutron into a proton. So the IAS in Zr would be the state where a neutron in Y is replaced by a proton, but keeping the isospin the same. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: The isospin quantum number T for a nucleus is (N-Z)/2. For ^90Y, T=(51-39)/2=6. For ^90Zr, T=(50-40)/2=5. The lowest T=6 state in Zr would be the isobaric analog of the Y ground state. The energy difference between these two states is due to the Coulomb energy difference and the mass difference.\n\nThe formula for the excitation energy E_ex is given by:\n\nE_ex = [M(^90Y) - M(^90Zr)]c² + ΔE_Coulomb\n\nWe already calculated [M(Y)-M(Zr)]c² ≈2.799 MeV. Then ΔE_Coulomb is the difference in Coulomb energy between Zr and Y. Using the semi-empirical formula:\n\nΔE_C = a_c*(Z_Zr² - Z_Y²)/A^(1/3) =0.72*(40² -39²)/90^(1/3)=0.72*79/4.48≈12.7 MeV\n\nSo E_ex≈2.799 +12.7≈15.5 MeV\n\nBut the answer seems a bit high. Let me check if there's a different way. Maybe the difference in binding energies is part of the calculation. The binding energy difference is 1.506 MeV (Zr more bound). The excitation energy would require overcoming this binding and adding the Coulomb energy. So E_ex = ΔE_Coulomb - (BE_Zr - BE_Y) =12.7 -1.506≈11.2 MeV\n\nBut why subtract? Because Zr is more bound, so to reach the excited state (which is less bound), you need to subtract the binding energy difference from the Coulomb energy difference? I'm confused.\n\nWait, the ground state of Zr is more bound than Y by 1.506 MeV. The IAS in Zr is analogous to Y's ground state, which is less bound. So the energy required to excite Zr to that state would be the Coulomb energy difference (which makes the IAS higher in energy) minus the binding energy difference (since Zr is more bound). Wait, no. If the IAS is less bound than Zr's ground state, then the excitation energy is the difference in binding energy plus the Coulomb energy difference. Wait, but the Coulomb energy is part of the binding energy. So perhaps the difference in binding energy already includes part of the Coulomb effect.\n\nAlternatively, the binding energy difference between Zr and Y is due to both the Coulomb energy and the symmetry energy (since they have different N-Z). The symmetry energy term in the semi-empirical formula is a_sym*(N-Z)²/A. For Zr, (N-Z)=10, so symmetry energy term is a_sym*(100)/90. For Y, (N-Z)=12, so symmetry energy term is a_sym*(144)/90. The difference in symmetry energy would be a_sym*(144-100)/90 =a_sym*(44)/90. If a_sym is about 23 MeV, then the difference is 23*(44)/90≈11.2 MeV. But this is a separate term. However, the binding energy difference is only 1.506 MeV, which is much smaller than this. So perhaps the binding energy difference is dominated by the Coulomb and symmetry energy differences, but they partially cancel each other.\n\nBut this might complicate things. The problem asks to estimate the excitation energy, so maybe there's a simpler relation. Let me think again.\n\nThe key point is that the IAS in Zr (T=6) corresponds to the ground state of Y (T=6). The energy of the IAS in Zr relative to the ground state of Zr is the difference in energy between Y's ground state and Zr's ground state, plus the Coulomb displacement energy. Wait, but how?\n\nThe energy of the IAS in Zr should be equal to the energy of Y's ground state plus the Coulomb energy difference. Then, since Zr's ground state is lower in energy (more bound), the excitation energy is:\n\nE_ex = (E_Y + ΔE_Coulomb) - E_Zr\n\nBut E_Y = -BE_Y and E_Zr = -BE_Zr, so:\n\nE_ex = (-BE_Y + ΔE_Coulomb) - (-BE_Zr) = (BE_Zr - BE_Y) + ΔE_Coulomb\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nBE_Zr - BE_Y =1.506 MeV\n\nΔE_Coulomb≈12.7 MeV\n\nThus, E_ex≈1.506 +12.7≈14.2 MeV\n\nBut earlier calculations using different methods gave around 13-15 MeV. However, the answer might be expected to be around 14 MeV. But let me check if there's a standard approximation.\n\nWait, another approach: The excitation energy is given by the difference in the Coulomb energies plus the difference in the symmetry energies. But since both nuclei have the same A, the symmetry energy term for Zr is a_sym*(N-Z)^2/A = a_sym*(10)^2/90, and for Y it's a_sym*(12)^2/90. The difference is a_sym*(144-100)/90 = a_sym*44/90. With a_sym≈23 MeV, this is 23*44/90≈11.2 MeV. The Coulomb energy difference is 0.72*(40²-39²)/90^(1/3)=12.7 MeV. So the total difference would be Coulomb difference minus symmetry difference:12.7 -11.2≈1.5 MeV. But the actual binding energy difference is 1.506 MeV, which matches. So this suggests that the binding energy difference is due to Coulomb and symmetry energy differences canceling to about 1.5 MeV.\n\nBut how does this relate to the excitation energy? The excitation energy of the IAS would be the Coulomb energy difference minus the symmetry energy difference, which is 12.7 -11.2=1.5 MeV, but that's the same as the binding energy difference. This seems circular.\n\nAlternatively, the excitation energy is the energy required to change the nucleus from Zr's ground state (T=5) to the T=6 state. This involves changing a proton into a neutron (since T increases by 1). The energy required would be related to the difference in the Coulomb potential and the symmetry energy. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another way: The lowest T=6 state in Zr is the isobaric analog of the Y ground state. The energy difference between these two states is due to the Coulomb energy difference. However, since Y is a different nucleus, we have to account for the mass difference. The formula is:\n\nE_ex (IAS) = [M(Y) - M(Zr)]c² + ΔE_Coulomb\n\nWe calculated [M(Y)-M(Zr)]c²≈2.8 MeV and ΔE_Coulomb≈12.7 MeV, totaling≈15.5 MeV. But this seems high. However, considering that the Coulomb displacement energy is significant, maybe this is the answer.\n\nBut let me check with another perspective. The excitation energy should be approximately equal to the Coulomb displacement energy between the two nuclei. The Coulomb displacement energy can be estimated as:\n\nΔE_C ≈ (1.44 MeV·fm) * Z * (Z+1) / (R A)\n\nWait, no, that's for beta decay. Alternatively, the Coulomb displacement energy between two isobars is approximately ΔE_C ≈ 1.44*(Z1^2 - Z2^2)/(2R). With Z1=40, Z2=39, R=1.2*A^(1/3)=1.2*4.48≈5.376 fm.\n\nSo ΔE_C=1.44*(40² -39²)/(2*5.376)=1.44*79/(10.752)=113.76/10.752≈10.58 MeV\n\nThen adding the mass difference of 2.8 MeV gives≈13.38 MeV. So approximately 13.4 MeV.\n\nBut the problem states to estimate, so maybe rounding to about 14 MeV. However, the given binding energies are precise, so perhaps a more accurate calculation is needed.\n\nAlternatively, using the given binding energies:\n\nThe difference in binding energy is 1.506 MeV (Zr more bound). The Coulomb energy difference is 12.7 MeV. So the excitation energy is 12.7 -1.506≈11.2 MeV. Wait, why subtract? Because the binding energy difference makes Zr more bound, so the excitation energy would be the Coulomb energy needed to overcome that. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the excitation energy is the Coulomb energy difference minus the binding energy difference. If the IAS is higher in energy due to Coulomb, but Zr is more bound, then the net excitation energy is 12.7 -1.506≈11.2 MeV.\n\nBut I'm not sure which approach is correct. Let me try to find a definitive formula.\n\nUpon checking, the excitation energy of the isobaric analog state in the parent nucleus (Zr) is given by:\n\nE_ex = ΔE_Coulomb + (M_child - M_parent)c²\n\nWhere ΔE_Coulomb is the difference in Coulomb energy between the parent and child nuclei, and (M_child - M_parent)c² is the mass difference. Here, the child nucleus is Y, and the parent is Zr.\n\nSo:\n\nE_ex = ΔE_Coulomb + [M(Y) - M(Zr)]c²\n\nWe have:\n\nΔE_Coulomb ≈12.7 MeV\n\n[M(Y) - M(Zr)]c²≈2.8 MeV\n\nThus, E_ex≈12.7 +2.8≈15.5 MeV\n\nBut this seems high. However, considering the problem says \"estimate\", and the possible calculation steps, this might be the intended answer. However, I'm still uncertain because different methods give different results.\n\nAlternatively, some sources indicate that the excitation energy of the IAS can be approximated by the Coulomb displacement energy, which for medium-heavy nuclei is roughly 10-20 MeV. Given that our Coulomb energy difference is around 12.7 MeV and the mass difference is about 2.8 MeV, adding them gives≈15.5 MeV. But maybe the correct answer is simply the Coulomb displacement energy of≈12.7 MeV, but the problem gives the binding energies, so we should use them.\n\nWait, another approach: The energy required to excite Zr to the T=6 state is the difference in energy between the T=6 state and the ground state. The T=6 state is the analog of Y's ground state. The energy difference between Y's ground state and Zr's ground state is [M(Y) - M(Zr)]c²≈2.8 MeV. But the T=6 state in Zr is at a higher energy due to the Coulomb repulsion. So the excitation energy would be this mass difference plus the Coulomb energy needed to add a proton. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the excitation energy is the difference in the binding energies plus the Coulomb energy difference. Since Zr is more bound by 1.506 MeV, but the Coulomb energy in Zr is higher by 12.7 MeV, the total excitation energy would be 12.7 -1.506≈11.2 MeV. This makes sense because the Coulomb energy makes the state higher, but the binding energy difference makes it lower. So net excitation energy is the difference.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent and the possible approaches, I think the most plausible answer is around 14-15 MeV, but given the options and the data, perhaps the correct calculation is:\n\nE_ex = ΔE_Coulomb + (BE_Zr - BE_Y)\n\nWait, no. If the IAS is higher in energy, then:\n\nE_ex = ΔE_Coulomb - (BE_Zr - BE_Y)\n\nBecause BE_Zr is larger, meaning Zr is more bound, so the excitation energy would be the Coulomb energy difference minus the extra binding. So:\n\n12.7 MeV -1.506 MeV≈11.2 MeV\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the other way around.\n\nAlternatively, the excitation energy is the energy required to go from Zr's ground state to the IAS, which is the same as Y's ground state energy plus Coulomb energy difference. Y's ground state energy is BE_Y lower than a free nucleon assembly, and Zr's ground state is BE_Zr lower. So the difference is BE_Zr - BE_Y =1.506 MeV. The Coulomb energy difference is 12.7 MeV. So the total excitation energy is 1.506 +12.7=14.2 MeV.\n\nThis seems to make sense: the IAS in Zr is like Y's state but with an extra Coulomb energy, so you have to add the binding energy difference (Zr more bound) and the Coulomb energy difference (Zr has higher Coulomb). So total excitation energy is their sum.\n\nGiven that, the answer would be approximately 14.2 MeV. Rounding to two significant figures, 14.2 MeV. But the given binding energies have three decimal places, but the answer is an estimate, so maybe round to 14 MeV.\n\nBut let me check one more time. The formula from Krane's \"Introductory Nuclear Physics\" might help. In chapter 8 on nuclear models, the isobaric analog states are discussed. The excitation energy of the IAS in the parent nucleus is given by:\n\nE_ex ≈ ΔE_Coulomb + ΔM c²\n\nWhere ΔM c² is the mass difference between the two isobars. For β decay, ΔM c² = Q_β. But in this case, the Q-value for β− decay of Y to Zr is:\n\nQ_β = [M(Y) - M(Zr)]c² = (BE_Zr - BE_Y) + (m_n - m_p)c² ≈1.506 +1.293≈2.799 MeV\n\nThen, the excitation energy of the IAS in Zr is:\n\nE_ex ≈ ΔE_Coulomb + Q_β ≈12.7 +2.8≈15.5 MeV\n\nBut Krane's book might have a different approach. Alternatively, according to some lecture notes, the excitation energy of the IAS is given by:\n\nE_ex = ΔE_Coulomb + (M_2 - M_1)c²\n\nWhere M_2 is the mass of the daughter nucleus (Y) and M_1 is the mass of the parent (Zr). So:\n\nE_ex = ΔE_Coulomb + (M_Y - M_Zr)c² ≈12.7 +2.8≈15.5 MeV\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 15.5 MeV. But given the problem states \"estimate\", and the possible approximations in Coulomb energy calculation, maybe the answer is expected to be around 14-15 MeV. However, using the semi-empirical mass formula for Coulomb energy gives ΔE_Coulomb≈12.7 MeV, and the mass difference≈2.8 MeV, totaling≈15.5 MeV. But let's compute it more precisely.\n\nFirst, compute 90^(1/3):\n\n90^(1/3) = e^(ln(90)/3) ≈ e^(4.4998/3) ≈e^(1.4999)≈4.4817\n\nSo 90^(1/3)≈4.4817\n\nΔE_Coulomb =0.72*(40² -39²)/4.4817=0.72*(1600-1521)/4.4817=0.72*79/4.4817=56.88/4.4817≈12.69 MeV\n\n[M(Y)-M(Zr)]c²= (BE_Zr - BE_Y) + (m_n -m_p)c²=1.506 +1.293≈2.799 MeV\n\nThus, E_ex=12.69 +2.799≈15.489 MeV≈15.5 MeV\n\nRounding to three significant figures as the given BEs have three decimal places but the answer is an estimate, it would be≈15.5 MeV. However, the problem might expect a different approach, such as simply taking the difference in binding energies and adding the Coulomb term as per the semi-empirical formula.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think: The excitation energy is the energy required to convert a proton into a neutron in the nucleus, considering the Coulomb and mass differences. The energy cost to convert a proton to a neutron is (m_n - m_p)c²≈1.293 MeV. But in the nucleus, this is modified by the binding energy difference and Coulomb energy.\n\nBut I think the correct approach is the one combining the mass difference and Coulomb energy, leading to≈15.5 MeV. However, given that the problem provides the binding energies, maybe there's a simpler way. Let's try:\n\nThe ground state of Y has T=6. The IAS in Zr is this state, so the energy difference between Y's ground state and Zr's ground state plus the Coulomb energy difference.\n\nThe energy of Y's ground state is -BE_Y, and Zr's ground state is -BE_Zr. The energy of the IAS in Zr is -BE_Y + ΔE_Coulomb. Therefore, the excitation energy is:\n\nE_ex = (-BE_Y + ΔE_Coulomb) - (-BE_Zr) = (BE_Zr - BE_Y) + ΔE_Coulomb\n\nPlugging in:\n\n1.506 MeV +12.69 MeV≈14.196 MeV≈14.2 MeV\n\nAh, this is different from the previous result. Why? Because here we are not including the mass", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0}
{"id": "atomic/1-36", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to derive a quantized condition on the magnetic flux for a semiclassical electron in a magnetic field, and then restate it in terms of the size S of the orbit in k-space. Let me start by recalling the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition. The original formula is the integral of p·dr over a closed orbit equals (n + 1/2) times 2πℏ. But when there's an electromagnetic field, we replace p with p - (eA)/c. So the modified condition becomes the integral of (p - eA/c)·dr equals (n + 1/2) times 2πℏ. \n\nWait, but the problem mentions using the equation of motion for the linear momentum p. Hmm. The equation of motion for p in an electromagnetic field would involve the Lorentz force. Let me think. In the presence of a magnetic field, the Lorentz force is (e/c)(v × B). But how does that relate to the momentum p? In classical mechanics, the canonical momentum p is related to the kinetic momentum mv by p = mv + (e/c)A. So maybe I need to express the integral in terms of the kinetic momentum. \n\nWait, the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition uses the canonical momentum. But when we replace p with p - eA/c, maybe that's equivalent to using the kinetic momentum. Let me check. If p_canonical = mv + (e/c)A, then p_canonical - (e/c)A = mv. So substituting p → p - eA/c in the original Bohr-Sommerfeld would give the integral of mv·dr equals (n + 1/2)2πℏ. But actually, the original Bohr-Sommerfeld uses the canonical momentum. So when we have a magnetic field, the substitution is necessary to account for the vector potential. \n\nBut the problem says to use the modified Bohr-Sommerfeld condition with p replaced by p - eA/c, so the integral becomes ∮(p - eA/c)·dr = (n + 1/2)2πℏ. But maybe I need to relate this to the magnetic flux. The magnetic flux Φ through the orbit is ∫B·dS, which by Stokes' theorem is equal to ∮A·dr. So the integral of A·dr around the closed orbit is Φ. \n\nSo let's split the modified Bohr-Sommerfeld integral into two parts: ∮p·dr - (e/c)∮A·dr = (n + 1/2)2πℏ. Then, substituting ∮A·dr = Φ, we get ∮p·dr - (e/c)Φ = (n + 1/2)2πℏ. \n\nBut now, what is ∮p·dr? In the absence of a magnetic field, that would be the original Bohr-Sommerfeld integral. But here, p is the canonical momentum. Wait, but maybe we can relate this to the equation of motion. The equation of motion for p would be dp/dt = -∇H + ... Hmm, perhaps using the Lorentz force equation. Let me think. The equation of motion for the kinetic momentum mv is d(mv)/dt = e(E + (v × B)/c). But since we're in a magnetic field, and assuming there's no electric field (so E=0), then d(mv)/dt = (e/c)(v × B). \n\nBut how does this relate to the integral of p·dr? Wait, maybe we need to express p in terms of mv. Since p = mv + (e/c)A, then mv = p - (e/c)A. So the kinetic momentum is p - (e/c)A. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider the integral ∮p·dr. If we substitute p = mv + (e/c)A, then ∮p·dr = ∮mv·dr + (e/c)∮A·dr. The first term is ∮mv·dr. But in the absence of a magnetic field, that would be the original Bohr-Sommerfeld integral. However, in the presence of a magnetic field, the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition is modified by replacing p with p - (e/c)A, so maybe the integral ∮(p - eA/c)·dr is the same as ∮mv·dr. \n\nWait, but the problem states that we should use the modified Bohr-Sommerfeld condition with p replaced by p - eA/c, so the left-hand side becomes ∮(p - eA/c)·dr. Then, according to the equation of motion for p, perhaps we can relate this to the magnetic flux. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that in a magnetic field, the motion is quantized such that the flux through the orbit is quantized. Let me recall the Aharonov-Bohm effect or Landau levels. For Landau levels, the flux quantum is hc/e, but here we might get a similar result. \n\nLet me proceed step by step. Starting with the modified Bohr-Sommerfeld condition:\n\n∮(p - (e/c)A)·dr = (n + 1/2)2πℏ.\n\nExpanding the integral:\n\n∮p·dr - (e/c)∮A·dr = (n + 1/2)2πℏ.\n\nNow, the term ∮A·dr is the magnetic flux Φ through the orbit, since by Stokes' theorem, ∮A·dr = ∫(∇×A)·dS = ∫B·dS = Φ. So:\n\n∮p·dr - (e/c)Φ = (n + 1/2)2πℏ.\n\nBut what is ∮p·dr? Let's think about the equation of motion for p. The canonical momentum p is related to the mechanical momentum mv by p = mv + (e/c)A. So mv = p - (e/c)A. Then, the integral ∮mv·dr would be ∮(p - (e/c)A)·dr, which is exactly the left-hand side of the modified Bohr-Sommerfeld condition. Wait, but the modified condition is already ∮(p - eA/c)·dr = ... So that integral is ∮mv·dr. Therefore, the original equation can be written as:\n\n∮mv·dr = (n + 1/2)2πℏ.\n\nBut in a magnetic field, the motion is circular or some closed orbit, and mv is related to the velocity. However, in a magnetic field, the Lorentz force provides the centripetal force. For a circular orbit of radius r, mv²/r = (e/c)vB. So mv = (eBr)/c. But how does this relate to the integral ∮mv·dr?\n\nWait, the integral ∮mv·dr is the same as the line integral of the mechanical momentum around the orbit. For a circular orbit, dr is tangential, and mv is in the direction of velocity, which is tangential. So ∮mv·dr = mv * circumference = mv * 2πr. But from the Lorentz force, mv²/r = (e/c)vB → mv = (eBr)/c. Substituting into the integral:\n\nmv * 2πr = (eBr/c) * 2πr = (eB/c) * 2πr².\n\nBut the area of the orbit is πr², so 2πr² = 2 * area. Wait, maybe I should express this in terms of the area. Let me denote the area enclosed by the orbit as S_real (in real space). Then, the flux Φ = B * S_real. So Φ = B * S_real.\n\nBut from the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition, we have:\n\n∮mv·dr = (n + 1/2)2πℏ.\n\nBut ∮mv·dr = (eB/c) * S_real * 2π? Wait, maybe not. Let's compute ∮mv·dr. For a circular orbit, mv is (eBr)/c, and the circumference is 2πr. So the integral is (eBr/c) * 2πr = (2πeB/c) r². But r² is related to the area S_real = πr². So r² = S_real/π. Therefore, the integral becomes (2πeB/c)(S_real/π) ) = (2eB/c) S_real. \n\nBut according to the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition, this equals (n + 1/2)2πℏ. So:\n\n(2eB/c) S_real = (n + 1/2)2πℏ.\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n(eB/c) S_real = (n + 1/2)πℏ.\n\nMultiply both sides by c/(eB):\n\nS_real = (n + 1/2) (πℏ c)/(eB).\n\nBut wait, this seems like the quantization of the area in real space. However, the problem mentions that in solids, the condition is restated in terms of the size S of the orbit in k-space. So we need to relate S_real to k-space.\n\nIn a solid, the electrons' motion in a magnetic field can be described using the semiclassical model where the orbit in k-space is quantized. The relationship between real space and k-space involves the magnetic length and the vector potential. Alternatively, the momentum in the presence of a magnetic field is related to the crystal momentum. Wait, in the semiclassical model, the equation of motion for k is given by ℏ dk/dt = - (e/c)(v × B). But perhaps I need to relate the real space orbit to the k-space orbit.\n\nAlternatively, in the semiclassical approach, the velocity v is (1/ℏ)∇_k ε(k), where ε(k) is the energy dispersion. But in a magnetic field, the electrons undergo cyclotron motion in k-space. The orbit in k-space is quantized. The area S in k-space would then be related to the magnetic field and the quantum number n.\n\nWait, let's recall that in the case of Landau levels, the area in k-space perpendicular to B is quantized. The formula is S = (2πeB/(ℏc))(n + 1/2). So maybe the quantization condition on S in k-space is S = (2πeB/(ℏc))(n + 1/2). But how do we derive this from the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition?\n\nLet me go back. The original Bohr-Sommerfeld condition after substitution gives:\n\n∮(p - eA/c)·dr = (n + 1/2)2πℏ.\n\nBut in a crystal, the momentum p is related to the crystal momentum ℏk. However, in the presence of a magnetic field, the canonical momentum is p = ℏk + (e/c)A. Wait, maybe the relation is p = ℏk + (e/c)A. If that's the case, then substituting into the modified Bohr-Sommerfeld condition:\n\n∮(ℏk + (e/c)A - eA/c)·dr = ∮ℏk·dr = (n + 1/2)2πℏ.\n\nSo the integral of ℏk·dr equals (n + 1/2)2πℏ. Dividing both sides by ℏ:\n\n∮k·dr = (n + 1/2)2π.\n\nBut in the semiclassical model, the relation between the real space orbit and k-space orbit is given by the equation of motion. The equation of motion in a magnetic field is ℏ dk/dt = - (e/c)v × B. For a uniform magnetic field in the z-direction, this leads to circular motion in both real space and k-space. The real space orbit and k-space orbit are related by a scaling factor involving the magnetic field.\n\nAlternatively, the area in k-space can be related to the magnetic flux. Let's consider that the integral ∮k·dr is equal to the area enclosed in k-space multiplied by some factor. Wait, but how? Let's think of the integral ∮k·dr. If the orbit in real space is a closed loop, and k is related to the momentum, then perhaps using Stokes' theorem in some way. But I need to relate this to the area in k-space.\n\nAlternatively, in the semiclassical approach, the motion in k-space is such that the Lorentz force causes a drift in k. The equation ℏ dk/dt = (e/c)(v × B). If B is in the z-direction, then dk/dt is proportional to v × B. For electrons moving in the x-y plane, v = (v_x, v_y, 0), so v × B is in the direction perpendicular to velocity and B, leading to circular motion in k-space. The radius in k-space would be related to the magnetic field and the velocity. \n\nBut perhaps there's a more direct way. Let's recall that in the semiclassical quantization, the phase space area is quantized. For the case of a magnetic field, the effective phase space is different. The Bohr-Sommerfeld condition in phase space (x, p) is quantized. But when we have a magnetic field, the momentum is modified by the vector potential. However, in solids, the crystal momentum ℏk is related to the canonical momentum p. So p = ℏk + (e/c)A. Therefore, substituting into the modified Bohr-Sommerfeld condition:\n\n∮(ℏk + (e/c)A - (e/c)A)·dr = ∮ℏk·dr = (n + 1/2)2πℏ.\n\nSo this simplifies to ∮k·dr = (n + 1/2)2π.\n\nNow, how to relate this integral to the area in k-space. Let's use the fact that in a periodic system, the integral of k·dr over a closed orbit can be related to the area enclosed in k-space. Wait, but how? Let's consider that in real space, the position r and k are related. For a closed orbit in real space, the corresponding orbit in k-space is also closed. Let's consider that the integral ∮k·dr can be transformed using Stokes' theorem. If we write this as the integral over the contour in real space of k·dr, then Stokes' theorem would relate it to the integral of the curl of k over the area enclosed by the contour. But curl of k in real space? That might not be straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can switch variables. Let's think of r as a function of k, or vice versa. In the presence of a magnetic field, the semiclassical equations of motion are:\n\ndr/dt = (1/ℏ)∇_k ε(k),\n\nℏ dk/dt = - (e/c)(dr/dt × B).\n\nAssuming B is in the z-direction, these equations lead to circular motion in both r and k. The solutions are such that the motion in k-space is a circle with radius k_0, and similarly in real space. The period of the orbit is the cyclotron period. \n\nBut how does this relate the integral ∮k·dr? Let's parameterize the orbit in terms of an angle θ. Suppose the orbit in k-space is a circle of radius k_0, so k_x = k_0 cosθ, k_y = k_0 sinθ. Then, the real space coordinates r would also execute a circular motion. From the equation dr/dt = (1/ℏ)∇_k ε(k). For free electrons, ε(k) = ℏ²k²/(2m), so ∇_k ε = ℏ² k/m. Thus, dr/dt = (ℏ k)/m. But in the presence of a magnetic field, the trajectory in k-space is a circle, so integrating dr/dt gives the real space trajectory. \n\nBut perhaps this is getting too detailed. Let's instead consider that the integral ∮k·dr can be related to the area in k-space. Let's use the fact that in two dimensions, the integral of k·dr over a closed contour is equal to twice the area enclosed by the contour in k-space. Wait, no. Wait, in general, for a vector field F, the line integral ∮F·dr over a closed loop is equal to the flux of the curl of F through the area enclosed by the loop. But here, F is k. So curl of k in real space would be (∂k_y/∂x - ∂k_x/∂y). But unless k is a function of r, which it is in this case due to the equations of motion, this might not be straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider that in the semiclassical motion, the trajectory in k-space is a closed loop, and the integral ∮k·dr can be related to the area in k-space. Let's consider that in the case of a circular orbit in k-space with radius k_0, the area S in k-space is πk_0². Then, how does ∮k·dr relate to S?\n\nBut maybe we can use the relation from the equations of motion. From ℏ dk/dt = - (e/c)(v × B), and v = dr/dt. Let's assume B is in the z-direction, B = B_z. Then, the equation becomes ℏ dk_x/dt = - (eB_z/c) dy/dt, and ℏ dk_y/dt = (eB_z/c) dx/dt. \n\nLet me rearrange these equations:\n\ndk_x = - (eB_z/(ℏ c)) dy,\n\ndk_y = (eB_z/(ℏ c)) dx.\n\nMultiplying the first equation by y and the second by x and integrating around the closed orbit might not help directly. Alternatively, consider the integral ∮k·dr = ∮(k_x dx + k_y dy). Let's substitute dk_x and dk_y from the equations of motion. \n\nFrom dk_x = - (eB/(ℏ c)) dy (assuming B_z = B),\n\ndk_y = (eB/(ℏ c)) dx.\n\nThen, substituting into the integral:\n\n∮k·dr = ∮(k_x dx + k_y dy).\n\nBut integrating this directly is not straightforward. Alternatively, let's consider integrating by parts or using some other relation. \n\nAlternatively, let's express dx and dy in terms of dk_x and dk_y. From the equations:\n\ndx = (ℏ c/(eB)) dk_y,\n\ndy = - (ℏ c/(eB)) dk_x.\n\nSo substituting into the integral:\n\n∮k·dr = ∮[k_x (ℏ c/(eB) dk_y) + k_y (-ℏ c/(eB) dk_x)].\n\n= (ℏ c/(eB)) ∮(k_x dk_y - k_y dk_x).\n\nThe integral ∮(k_x dk_y - k_y dk_x) is equal to 2 times the area enclosed in k-space. Because in 2D, the area can be written as (1/2)∮(x dy - y dx), so similarly, (1/2)∮(k_x dk_y - k_y dk_x) = S, the area in k-space. Therefore, the integral becomes:\n\n(ℏ c/(eB)) * 2S.\n\nSo ∮k·dr = (ℏ c/(eB)) * 2S.\n\nBut from the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition, we have:\n\n∮k·dr = (n + 1/2)2π.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(ℏ c/(eB)) * 2S = (n + 1/2)2π.\n\nSimplifying:\n\nS = (eB/(ℏ c)) * (n + 1/2)2π / 2\n\n= (eB/(ℏ c)) * π (n + 1/2)\n\n= (2π e B/(ℏ c)) * (n + 1/2) * (1/2) * 2\n\nWait, let me redo the algebra:\n\nStarting from:\n\n(ℏ c/(eB)) * 2S = (n + 1/2)2π\n\nMultiply both sides by (eB)/(ℏ c * 2):\n\nS = (n + 1/2)2π * (eB)/(ℏ c * 2) * (ℏ c)/(eB)) * 2S = ... Wait, no. Let's solve for S:\n\n2S (ℏ c)/(eB) = 2π(n + 1/2)\n\nDivide both sides by 2 (ℏ c)/(eB):\n\nS = [2π(n + 1/2) * eB]/(2ℏ c)\n\nSimplify:\n\nS = π e B (n + 1/2)/(ℏ c)\n\nBut wait, the standard result for Landau levels is that the area in k-space is S = (2π e B)/(h c) (n + 1/2). Since h = 2πℏ, substituting:\n\nS = (2π e B)/(2πℏ c) (n + 1/2) = (e B)/(ℏ c) (n + 1/2).\n\nBut according to our derivation, we have S = π e B (n + 1/2)/(ℏ c). There's a discrepancy here. Let me check where I might have gone wrong.\n\nWait, the integral ∮(k_x dk_y - k_y dk_x) is equal to 2 times the area S in k-space. So:\n\n(1/2)∮(k_x dk_y - k_y dk_x) = S.\n\nTherefore, ∮(k_x dk_y - k_y dk_x) = 2S.\n\nSo substituting back into the expression for ∮k·dr:\n\n∮k·dr = (ℏ c/(eB)) * 2S.\n\nBut from Bohr-Sommerfeld:\n\n∮k·dr = (n + 1/2)2π.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(ℏ c/(eB)) * 2S = (n + 1/2)2π.\n\nSolving for S:\n\nS = (n + 1/2)2π * (eB)/(2ℏ c)\n\n= (n + 1/2)π e B/(ℏ c).\n\nBut the standard result is S = (2π e B)/(h c) (n + 1/2). Since h = 2πℏ, this becomes S = (e B)/(ℏ c) (n + 1/2). But according to our calculation, S = π e B (n + 1/2)/(ℏ c). There's a factor of π discrepancy. Where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I think the mistake is in the relation between the integral ∮(k_x dk_y - k_y dk_x) and the area S. Let me recall that in polar coordinates, if k_x = k cosθ, k_y = k sinθ, then dk_x = -k sinθ dθ, dk_y = k cosθ dθ. Then, k_x dk_y - k_y dk_x = k cosθ (k cosθ dθ) - k sinθ (-k sinθ dθ) = k² cos²θ dθ + k² sin²θ dθ = k² dθ. Integrating from 0 to 2π gives ∮(k_x dk_y - k_y dk_x) = ∫0^{2π} k² dθ = 2π k². But the area S is πk², so this integral equals 2S. Therefore, ∮(k_x dk_y - k_y dk_x) = 2S. Therefore, my previous step was correct. So the integral ∮k·dr = (ℏ c/(eB)) * 2S. Then setting equal to (n + 1/2)2π:\n\n(ℏ c/(eB)) * 2S = (n + 1/2)2π → S = (n + 1/2)2π * (eB)/(2ℏ c) → S = (n + 1/2)π e B/(ℏ c).\n\nBut this contradicts the standard Landau level result. Wait, perhaps the standard result uses a different convention. Let me check the Landau level quantization. The quantized orbits in k-space for Landau levels have area S = (2π e B)/(h c) (n + 1/2). Since h = 2πℏ, this is S = (2π e B)/(2πℏ c) (n + 1/2) = (e B)/(ℏ c) (n + 1/2). But according to our derivation, S = π e B (n + 1/2)/(ℏ c). There's a factor of π difference. Where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from the relation between the real space orbit and the k-space orbit. In the semiclassical approach, the area in k-space S is related to the magnetic field and the quantum number n. Let's consider the case of a free electron. The energy levels are Landau levels, and the area in k-space perpendicular to B is quantized as S = (2π e B)/(h c) (n + 1/2). Converting to SI units, but here we are using Gaussian units where the flux is in cgs. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the factor of π comes from the integral ∮k·dr. Let me think differently. Suppose we have the integral ∮k·dr = 2π(n + 1/2). From the equations of motion, we related this integral to the area S in k-space. But according to our derivation, S = (n + 1/2)π e B/(ℏ c). However, the standard result is S = (n + 1/2)2π e B/(h c). Since h = 2πℏ, this becomes S = (n + 1/2)2π e B/(2πℏ c) = (n + 1/2)e B/(ℏ c). So there's a discrepancy. \n\nWait, perhaps the error is in the substitution from the equations of motion. Let's re-examine that step. We had:\n\nFrom the equations:\n\ndk_x = - (eB/(ℏ c)) dy,\n\ndk_y = (eB/(ℏ c)) dx.\n\nThen, substituting into ∮k·dr = ∮(k_x dx + k_y dy).\n\nBut using the expressions for dx and dy in terms of dk_x and dk_y:\n\nFrom dk_x = - (eB/(ℏ c)) dy → dy = - (ℏ c/(eB)) dk_x,\n\nSimilarly, dk_y = (eB/(ℏ c)) dx → dx = (ℏ c/(eB)) dk_y.\n\nTherefore, substituting into the integral:\n\n∮k·dr = ∮[k_x dx + k_y dy] = ∮[k_x (ℏ c/(eB) dk_y) + k_y (-ℏ c/(eB) dk_x)]\n\n= (ℏ c/(eB)) ∮(k_x dk_y - k_y dk_x)\n\nAs before, this integral is (ℏ c/(eB)) * 2S, where S is the area in k-space.\n\nBut according to the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition, this equals (n + 1/2)2π. Therefore:\n\n(ℏ c/(eB)) * 2S = (n + 1/2)2π → S = (n + 1/2)2π * (eB)/(2ℏ c) → S = (n + 1/2)π e B/(ℏ c).\n\nBut the standard result is S = (n + 1/2)2π e B/(h c) = (n + 1/2)e B/(ℏ c). So there's a factor of π discrepancy. \n\nWait, maybe the original Bohr-Sommerfeld condition includes a factor of 1/2. The original condition is ∮p dq = (n + 1/2)h. For a two-dimensional integral, the phase space area is quantized as (n + 1/2)h. But in our case, we're dealing with a line integral in real space, which relates to the area in k-space. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that ∮k·dr relates directly to the area in k-space. Let me think of units. The integral ∮k·dr is dimensionless? No, k has units of inverse length, dr has units of length, so the integral is dimensionless. The right-hand side is (n + 1/2)2π, which is dimensionless. The area S in k-space has units of (1/length)^2. The expression we derived for S has units of (eB)/(ℏ c) * (n + 1/2). eB has units of (charge * magnetic field), which in cgs units, B is in Gauss, e in esu. Magnetic field has units of gauss = (dyne/esu)^1/2. So eB has units of esu * (dyne/esu)^1/2) = (esu)^{1/2} (dyne)^{1/2}. Hmm, not sure. But ℏ has units of erg·s, c is cm/s. Maybe the units do work out. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct result is S = (2π e B)/(h c) (n + 1/2). Let's plug in the constants. If we take h = 2πℏ, then S = (2π e B)/(2πℏ c) (n + 1/2) = (e B)/(ℏ c) (n + 1/2). But according to our derivation, S = π e B/(ℏ c) (n + 1/2). So there's an extra factor of π. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the definition of the orbit area in k-space. In the semiclassical approach, the orbit in k-space is the Fermi surface cross-section. For a free electron in a magnetic field, the k-space orbit is a circle with radius k = sqrt(2mε)/ℏ. But when quantized, the area is S = (n + 1/2)2π e B/(ℏ c). Wait, no. For Landau levels, the energy is quantized as ε_n = (ℏω_c)(n + 1/2), where ω_c = eB/(m c). The corresponding k-space area can be found from the relation m v²/2 = ε_n, and v = ℏ k/m. So ε_n = ℏ² k²/(2m) = (ℏ e B/(m c))(n + 1/2). Solving for k²:\n\nk² = (2 e B/(ℏ c))(n + 1/2).\n\nThus, the area S = π k² = 2π e B/(ℏ c) (n + 1/2). But this contradicts our previous result. Wait, according to this, S = 2π e B/(ℏ c) (n + 1/2). But according to our derivation, S = π e B/(ℏ c) (n + 1/2). So there's a factor of 2 discrepancy. \n\nThis suggests that there's an error in the derivation. Let's go back to the step where we related the integral ∮k·dr to the area S. We found that ∮k·dr = (ℏ c/(eB)) * 2S. But according to the Landau level calculation, S should be 2π e B/(ℏ c) (n + 1/2). Let's set our expression equal to that:\n\nFrom our derivation:\n\nS = π e B/(ℏ c) (n + 1/2).\n\nBut Landau levels give S = 2π e B/(ℏ c) (n + 1/2). So there's a factor of 2 missing. Where did that come from?\n\nWait, perhaps the integral ∮k·dr is not directly 2S times (ℏ c/(eB)), but there's an additional factor. Let me re-examine the substitution. We had:\n\n∮k·dr = (ℏ c/(eB)) * ∮(k_x dk_y - k_y dk_x).\n\nBut ∮(k_x dk_y - k_y dk_x) = 2S, so:\n\n∮k·dr = (ℏ c/(eB)) * 2S.\n\nBut according to the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition, ∮k·dr = (n + 1/2)2π.\n\nThus:\n\n(ℏ c/(eB)) * 2S = (n + 1/2)2π → S = (n + 1/2)2π * (eB)/(2ℏ c) → S = (n + 1/2)π e B/(ℏ c).\n\nBut according to Landau levels, S should be twice that. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the substitution step. Let me check the equations of motion again. \n\nThe equations of motion are:\n\nℏ dk_x/dt = - (eB/c) dy/dt,\n\nℏ dk_y/dt = (eB/c) dx/dt.\n\nRearranging:\n\ndk_x = - (eB/(ℏ c)) dy,\n\ndk_y = (eB/(ℏ c)) dx.\n\nTherefore, substituting into the integral:\n\n∮k·dr = ∮(k_x dx + k_y dy) = ∮[k_x (ℏ c/(eB) dk_y) + k_y (-ℏ c/(eB) dk_x)].\n\n= (ℏ c/(eB)) ∮(k_x dk_y - k_y dk_x).\n\nBut this integral is (ℏ c/(eB)) times the integral of k_x dk_y - k_y dk_x, which we established is 2S. So the calculation seems correct. \n\nBut according to Landau levels, the area S in k-space is 2π e B/(ℏ c) (n + 1/2). So unless there's a missing factor of 2 somewhere else. Wait, perhaps the original Bohr-Sommerfeld condition includes a factor of 1/2 from the phase space. The original condition is ∮p dq = (n + 1/2)h. For each pair of conjugate variables (p, q), the integral is (n + 1/2)h. But in two dimensions, perhaps the condition is different. Wait, the problem is in two dimensions, but the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition is applied to the closed orbit in real space, which is a 1D integral. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the mistake is in the assumption that the modified Bohr-Sommerfeld condition is ∮(p - eA/c)·dr = (n + 1/2)2πℏ. But perhaps the correct condition is ∮(p - eA/c)·dr = (n + γ)2πℏ, where γ is the Maslov index, which is 1/2 for simple cases. But the problem states to use the given modified condition, so we should proceed with that. \n\nGiven that, our derivation leads to S = π e B (n + 1/2)/(ℏ c). However, this contradicts the standard result. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the derivation. Let me try an alternative approach. \n\nConsider the original modified Bohr-Sommerfeld condition:\n\n∮(p - eA/c)·dr = (n + 1/2)2πℏ.\n\nExpressing p in terms of the crystal momentum ℏk, which in the presence of a magnetic field is related to the canonical momentum by p = ℏk + (e/c)A. Therefore, substituting into the left-hand side:\n\n∮(ℏk + (e/c)A - eA/c)·dr = ∮ℏk·dr = (n + 1/2)2πℏ.\n\nThus, ∮k·dr = (n + 1/2)2π.\n\nNow, to relate this to the area in k-space. Let's use the relation from the equations of motion. From ℏ dk/dt = - (e/c)v × B. For a magnetic field in the z-direction, this becomes:\n\nℏ dk_x/dt = - (eB/c) v_y,\n\nℏ dk_y/dt = (eB/c) v_x.\n\nThe velocity v is related to the derivative of the energy: v = (1/ℏ)∇_k ε. For simplicity, assume a free electron gas where ε = ℏ² k²/(2m). Then, v = ℏ k/m. Substituting into the equations of motion:\n\ndk_x/dt = - (eB/(ℏ c)) (ℏ k_y/m) = - (eB/(m c)) k_y,\n\ndk_y/dt = (eB/(m c)) k_x.\n\nThese are the equations for simple harmonic motion. The solutions are circular orbits in k-space with angular frequency ω_c = eB/(m c), the cyclotron frequency. The radius of the orbit in k-space is k_0, and the area is S = π k_0². \n\nThe period of the orbit is T = 2π/ω_c = 2π m c/(eB). The integral ∮k·dr over one orbit can be computed by noting that dr = v dt = (ℏ k/m) dt. Therefore, ∮k·dr = ∮k·(�", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0}
{"id": "atomic/2-27", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to answer this question about the binding energy per nucleon curve. Let me start by recalling what I know about nuclear binding energy. The binding energy per nucleon is the energy required to split a nucleus into its individual protons and neutrons, divided by the number of nucleons. The curve typically has a maximum around iron-56, right? So the maximum should be near iron, which is around mass number 56. The binding energy per nucleon increases with mass number up to that point and then decreases for heavier nuclei.\n\nFirst, I need to sketch the curve. The curve starts at low mass numbers (like hydrogen) with lower binding energy per nucleon, rises to a peak around iron, and then gradually decreases for heavier elements like uranium. The values for binding energy per nucleon are usually in the range of 1-8 MeV. For hydrogen, it's around 1 MeV, then it increases. For helium-4, it's about 7 MeV. Then it keeps increasing until iron-56, which has the highest binding energy per nucleon of around 8.8 MeV. After that, for heavier nuclei like uranium-238, it drops to around 7.5 MeV per nucleon.\n\nSo the maximum of the curve is at iron-56, with approximately 8.8 MeV per nucleon. That's the peak point. Now, explaining nuclear fission using this curve. Fission occurs when a heavy nucleus, like uranium-235, splits into two smaller nuclei. Since the binding energy per nucleon is higher for the products (which are closer to the peak) than the original heavy nucleus, the process releases energy. The energy comes from the difference in binding energy between the initial nucleus and the products. The total energy released would be the difference multiplied by the number of nucleons involved.\n\nTo estimate the energy release per fission of uranium-235, let's think. If uranium-235 splits into two medium-mass nuclei, say, each around mass number 117 (but actually, they might split into something like 95 and 137, but maybe average around 117). The binding energy per nucleon for uranium is about 7.6 MeV, and for the products, maybe around 8.5 MeV (since that's near the peak). The difference is about 0.9 MeV per nucleon. Multiply that by 235 nucleons: 0.9 * 235 ≈ 211.5 MeV. But wait, that seems high. Wait, maybe the actual difference is a bit less. Let me check typical values. I remember that the energy released per fission of U-235 is around 200 MeV. So maybe the difference is closer to 0.85 MeV per nucleon. Let's see: 235 * 0.85 ≈ 200 MeV. That makes sense. So the estimation would be approximately 200 MeV per fission.\n\nBut how exactly is this calculated? The actual calculation would take the binding energy of the original nucleus and subtract the binding energies of the fission products. For example, if U-235 has a binding energy of about 7.6 MeV per nucleon, and the two fission products have, say, 8.5 MeV each, then the difference is 0.9 MeV per nucleon. But since the total number of nucleons is roughly the same (235 splits into two, so total nucleons remain ~235), the total energy released is (8.5 -7.6)*235 ≈ 0.9*235 ≈ 211.5 MeV. But maybe the actual values vary. For example, U-235's binding energy per nucleon is approximately 7.59 MeV. If the products average around 8.5 MeV, then 8.5 -7.59 = 0.91 MeV per nucleon. 0.91 * 235 ≈ 214 MeV. But standard references say around 200 MeV, so maybe the average increase is a bit less. Alternatively, maybe the products are not exactly at the peak. Let's say the products have an average binding energy of 8.3 MeV. Then 8.3 -7.59 = 0.71 MeV per nucleon. 0.71 *235 ≈ 167 MeV. Hmm, but that's lower. Maybe the actual products vary, and some of the energy comes from the release of neutrons as well. Wait, in fission, a few neutrons are released. For U-235, typical fission releases 2-3 neutrons. So the total mass of the products is a bit less than 235. Let's say 235 splits into two parts with mass numbers around 140 and 90, plus 3 neutrons. So total nucleons in the two fragments: 140 +90 =230, plus 3 neutrons, total 233. So the original is 235, so 235 -233 =2 nucleons missing? Wait, maybe the exact numbers vary. But perhaps the main point is that the binding energy per nucleon of the fragments is higher than that of the original uranium nucleus, leading to a net release of energy.\n\nAlternatively, the energy released is the difference in total binding energy between the parent and the products. So if the parent has a total binding energy of 235 * 7.6 ≈ 1786 MeV, and the two products have, say, 140 *8.5 + 90*8.5 = (140+90)*8.5 =230*8.5=1955 MeV. Then the difference is 1955 -1786 =169 MeV. Plus, the neutrons released (say, 2) have some kinetic energy, but maybe that's part of the energy release. But standard figures say around 200 MeV per fission. So perhaps the actual binding energy of the products is higher. Let me check actual values. Iron-56 has about 8.8 MeV per nucleon. For medium-mass nuclei around A=120, the binding energy per nucleon is around 8.5 MeV. Wait, maybe the actual binding energy of the fragments is higher. For example, if the two fragments have binding energies around 8.5 MeV each, then total is 230*8.5=1955. Original U-235 is 235*7.59≈1783. So difference is 1955-1783=172 MeV. But then where does the rest come from? Maybe the neutrons released also contribute. Wait, the neutrons are free, so their binding energy is zero. So if you have 3 neutrons released, their binding energy is zero. So the total binding energy of the products is 1955 + 0 =1955. Original is 1783. So the difference is 172 MeV. But standard energy per fission is about 200 MeV. Hmm, maybe the actual binding energy per nucleon of the fragments is higher. Let me check some actual data. For example, for Ba-141, binding energy per nucleon is around 8.3 MeV, and Kr-92 is around 8.7. So average might be around 8.5. So maybe the calculation is roughly 170 MeV from binding energy difference. But then why is the standard answer around 200 MeV? Maybe there's also the contribution from the Coulomb energy released when the nucleus splits. Wait, no, the binding energy already includes the Coulomb and nuclear forces. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done using mass defect rather than binding energy. Because binding energy is the energy equivalent of the mass defect. So maybe the actual energy comes from the mass difference between the original nucleus and the products. For example, U-235 has a certain mass, and when it splits into two lighter nuclei plus neutrons, the total mass of the products is less than the original mass. The mass difference times c² gives the energy. So perhaps using binding energy per nucleon is a way to approximate that. But maybe the actual energy release is calculated more accurately using mass defects. For example, the mass of U-235 is about 235.043924 u. When it fissions, typical products might have a total mass less by about 0.2 u. Since 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c², so 0.2 *931.5 ≈186 MeV. That's closer to the 200 MeV figure. So maybe the actual energy release is around 200 MeV, considering both the binding energy difference and the mass defect. So the estimation would be approximately 200 MeV per fission.\n\nNow, the force responsible for the form of the curve in the upper mass region. The binding energy curve is a result of the balance between the strong nuclear force, which is attractive and short-range, and the Coulomb repulsion between protons. For lighter nuclei, the strong force dominates as nucleons are close, so adding more nucleons increases binding energy per nucleon. But in heavier nuclei (upper mass region), the Coulomb repulsion becomes more significant because the nucleus is larger, and protons are farther apart, so the repulsive force reduces the binding energy. Hence, the curve decreases for heavy nuclei because the Coulomb force is making the nucleus less tightly bound. Therefore, the principal force responsible for the decrease in binding energy per nucleon in the upper mass region is the Coulomb repulsion.\n</think>\n\nThe binding energy per nucleon curve peaks at iron-56 (⁵⁶Fe) with a binding energy of approximately **8.8 MeV per nucleon**. The curve rises from light nuclei (e.g., hydrogen at ~1 MeV/nucleon) to this maximum and then decreases for heavier nuclei (e.g., uranium-235 at ~7.6 MeV/nucleon).  \n\n**Nuclear Fission Explanation**:  \nHeavy nuclei like ²³⁵U undergo fission because splitting into two medium-mass nuclei (e.g., ~140 and ~95 amu) moves the products closer to the peak of the curve.

{"id": "atomic/2-18", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this problem about the scattering of a 1-keV proton by a hydrogen atom. There are two parts: part (a) asks about the angular distribution and part (b) wants an estimate of the total cross-section. Let me start with part (a).\n\nFirst, I remember that when particles scatter off each other, the angular distribution depends on the interaction potential. For example, Rutherford scattering, which is due to Coulomb interaction, has a characteristic 1/sin^4(θ/2) dependence. But here, the projectile is a proton, and the target is a hydrogen atom. Wait, a hydrogen atom has a nucleus (a proton) and an electron. So when a proton scatters off a hydrogen atom, what's the dominant interaction here?\n\nAt 1 keV kinetic energy, the proton's energy is relatively low. Let me think about the energy scales. The binding energy of the electron in a hydrogen atom is about 13.6 eV. The proton's kinetic energy is 1 keV, which is much higher than the binding energy. But wait, the proton is much heavier than the electron. So when the proton collides with the hydrogen atom, does it mainly interact with the nucleus (the proton in the hydrogen) or the electron?\n\nSince the proton is a charged particle, it will interact with both the nucleus and the electron. However, because the proton is much heavier than the electron, the momentum transfer in a collision with the electron would be small. But the kinetic energy here is 1 keV. Let me calculate the velocity of the proton. The kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². The mass of a proton is about 1.67e-27 kg. So 1 keV is 1000 eV, which is 1.6e-16 J. So solving for v: v = sqrt(2E/m) = sqrt(2*1.6e-16 / 1.67e-27) ≈ sqrt(3.2e-16 / 1.67e-27) ≈ sqrt(1.916e11) ≈ 4.38e5 m/s. That's a pretty high speed, but protons are heavy. \n\nBut when a proton scatters off a hydrogen atom, the primary interaction would be Coulomb scattering between the incoming proton and the nucleus (the proton in the hydrogen). Because the electrons are much lighter, even though the incoming proton could interact with the electron, the cross-section for that would be smaller. However, since the hydrogen atom is neutral overall (proton + electron), maybe the incoming proton sees a neutral charge at large distances? Wait, but the hydrogen atom's charge is neutral, but the proton is a charged particle. So the incoming proton would interact with the nucleus (proton) via Coulomb repulsion, and with the electron via Coulomb attraction. But the electron is a point charge around the nucleus. However, the hydrogen atom's electron is in a cloud, so maybe the incoming proton would polarize the hydrogen atom, leading to some kind of screening?\n\nAlternatively, maybe at 1 keV energy, the proton's energy is high enough that the collision is fast, so the electron doesn't have time to respond—so the interaction is primarily with the nucleus. Because the proton is moving quickly, the collision time is short, and the electron's response (polarization) is negligible. So the scattering would be similar to proton-proton scattering, i.e., Rutherford scattering. But Rutherford scattering applies to bare nuclei, but here the target is a hydrogen atom, which has an electron shielding the nucleus. Wait, but if the incoming proton's energy is 1 keV, which is much higher than the binding energy of the electron (13.6 eV), then maybe the electron is stripped off during the collision? Or does the incoming proton not have enough energy to ionize the hydrogen atom?\n\nThe ionization energy is 13.6 eV. The incoming proton has 1 keV, which is about 73 times the ionization energy. So the proton has more than enough energy to ionize the hydrogen atom. But does that affect the scattering process? If the collision results in ionization, then the scattering is inelastic. However, the problem is about scattering, so maybe we're considering elastic scattering here. But the question doesn't specify. Hmm.\n\nWait, part (a) is about angular distribution. If the scattering is elastic and the interaction is Coulomb, then Rutherford scattering applies. But Rutherford scattering formula is for unscreened Coulomb potential. However, in a neutral atom, the nuclear charge is screened by the electron. So the Coulomb potential of the nucleus is screened beyond a certain distance, the screening radius. The screening effect would modify the scattering cross-section, especially at small angles (large impact parameters). But if the energy is high enough that the projectile penetrates the screening cloud, then the scattering would resemble Rutherford scattering.\n\nBut the proton's energy here is 1 keV. Let's calculate the de Broglie wavelength. The momentum p = sqrt(2mE). For a proton, m = 1.67e-27 kg, E = 1e3 eV = 1.6e-16 J. So p = sqrt(2 * 1.67e-27 kg * 1.6e-16 J) ≈ sqrt(5.34e-43) ≈ 7.3e-22 kg m/s. The de Broglie wavelength λ = h/p ≈ 6.626e-34 / 7.3e-22 ≈ 9.07e-13 m, which is about 0.9 femtometers. The size of a hydrogen atom is about the Bohr radius, 5.29e-11 meters, which is much larger. So the wavelength is much smaller than the atomic size. So the proton's wavelength is very small, meaning it's in the classical regime. So scattering can be treated classically.\n\nBut the screening length (roughly the atomic radius) is much larger than the de Broglie wavelength. Wait, but the screening length is the Bohr radius, which is 5e-11 m, and the de Broglie wavelength is 9e-13 m. So the wavelength is much smaller than the screening length. That suggests that the proton can resolve distances smaller than the atom, so the screening might not be effective. Wait, but the Coulomb interaction between the incoming proton and the target proton in the hydrogen atom would be screened by the electron only at distances larger than the Bohr radius. But if the collision is such that the impact parameter is smaller than the Bohr radius, then the screening is not effective, and the scattering is similar to Rutherford scattering. For impact parameters larger than the Bohr radius, the charge is screened, so the potential falls off faster, leading to less scattering.\n\nBut the cross-section for scattering is dominated by small impact parameters (close collisions), which would be unscreened. So maybe the angular distribution is similar to Rutherford scattering at large angles (small impact parameters), but suppressed at small angles (large impact parameters) due to screening. However, the problem states that the projectile is a 1-keV proton. Let's think about the typical scattering angles.\n\nIn Rutherford scattering, the differential cross-section is proportional to 1/sin^4(θ/2). But with screening, the cross-section is modified at small angles. The screening angle θ_min can be estimated by the ratio of the de Broglie wavelength to the screening length. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the screening can be modeled using a screened Coulomb potential, like the Yukawa potential: V(r) = (e^2 / 4πε₀ r) * e^{-r/a}, where a is the screening length (Bohr radius here). The differential cross-section for a Yukawa potential can be calculated, and it modifies the Rutherford formula by introducing a factor that depends on the screening.\n\nBut maybe at 1 keV, the scattering is still mostly in the unscreened regime. Wait, the Coulomb interaction energy at the Bohr radius is E = (e^2)/(4πε₀ a_0) ≈ 27.2 eV (since the ionization energy is 13.6 eV, which is half of that). The kinetic energy of the proton is 1 keV, which is much higher than the potential energy at the Bohr radius. So when the proton comes within a distance comparable to the Bohr radius, the potential energy is about 27 eV, which is much less than the kinetic energy (1 keV). Therefore, the proton's trajectory is not much affected by the potential at the Bohr radius; it would require a closer approach for significant deflection. So the scattering is dominated by small impact parameters, where the screening is negligible, so the cross-section is approximately Rutherford.\n\nBut wait, the target is a hydrogen atom, which is neutral. So at large distances, the incoming proton sees a neutral charge. However, as it approaches, it starts to see the nucleus. So the scattering would be similar to Rutherford scattering but with a cutoff at large impact parameters (small angles) due to screening. Therefore, the differential cross-section would follow the Rutherford formula at large angles but drop off at small angles. The angular distribution would have a peak at small angles, but maybe not as pronounced as pure Rutherford.\n\nAlternatively, since the proton is charged, even though the hydrogen atom is neutral, the incoming proton would interact with the charges inside the atom. The electron's charge is spread out, so the proton's interaction with the electron is a weaker, distributed charge. The interaction with the nucleus is a point charge. So the main contribution to scattering would be from the nucleus, but the electron's presence might screen the nuclear charge at larger distances.\n\nBut given that the kinetic energy is 1 keV, which is much higher than the binding energy, the collision time is short, so the electron doesn't have time to adjust—so the scattering is effectively with a bare proton (the nucleus), but with some screening. Wait, but the target is a hydrogen atom, so the nucleus is a proton. So the incoming proton is scattering off another proton in the hydrogen atom. But the hydrogen atom's proton is surrounded by an electron. So the incoming proton would feel the Coulomb repulsion from the target proton, but the electron's charge is opposite, so at large distances, the net charge is zero. But as the incoming proton approaches, it would start to feel the repulsion from the target proton. So the screening by the electron would reduce the effective charge at large distances.\n\nThis is similar to the concept of a screened Coulomb potential. The screening length here is the Bohr radius. The scattering cross-section would then be modified from Rutherford by the screening effect. The differential cross-section would be something like the Rutherford formula multiplied by a form factor. For a hydrogen atom, the form factor might account for the distribution of the electron charge. However, since the incoming proton is interacting with both the nucleus and the electron, but the nucleus is a point charge, the form factor might not significantly affect the scattering off the nucleus unless the impact parameter is large.\n\nAlternatively, since the target is a neutral atom, the leading interaction might be a dipole or induced dipole interaction. But protons are charged, so maybe the dominant interaction is still Coulomb, but with screening. However, the problem is about elastic scattering. If the collision is elastic, then the hydrogen atom remains in its ground state. The scattering would then involve the interaction between the incoming proton and the entire hydrogen atom, considering its charge distribution.\n\nThe charge distribution of hydrogen is a point nucleus (proton) and an electron cloud. The electrostatic potential from the hydrogen atom at a distance r from the nucleus is the sum of the proton's potential and the electron's potential. The electron's potential is that of a spherically symmetric charge distribution. For the ground state, the electron's charge density is ρ(r) = -e*(1/(πa_0^3)) e^{-2r/a_0}. The potential due to the electron at a point outside the atom would be similar to a point charge, but inside the atom, it's different. However, for distances much larger than the Bohr radius, the hydrogen atom's potential is zero (neutral). For distances smaller than the Bohr radius, the potential is mainly due to the proton, since the electron's charge is spread out.\n\nSo when the incoming proton is at a distance r from the target proton, if r is much smaller than the Bohr radius, the potential is approximately that of a proton (charge +e), but if r is much larger, the potential is screened by the electron, leading to a net charge zero. Therefore, the scattering would be Rutherford-like for small impact parameters (close collisions) and suppressed for large impact parameters (distant collisions).\n\nThe differential cross-section would then have the Rutherford form at large angles (small impact parameters) and a cutoff at small angles (large impact parameters). The angular distribution would peak in the forward direction (small angles) but follow Rutherford at larger angles. Wait, but Rutherford cross-section diverges as θ approaches 0. However, with screening, the cross-section becomes finite at θ=0. So the angular distribution would have a peak at θ=0, but decrease more rapidly than Rutherford at larger angles. Wait, no—screening typically cuts off the cross-section at very small angles. So the differential cross-section would look like Rutherford for angles above a certain critical angle and drop off below that.\n\nBut how does this affect the shape of the angular distribution? The Rutherford cross-section is sharply peaked in the forward direction (θ=0). With screening, the cross-section is still peaked forward but doesn't go to infinity. So the angular distribution would have a peak at θ=0, but the cross-section would be finite there. However, for angles larger than the screening angle, the cross-section follows Rutherford. So the graph would show a sharp rise as θ approaches 0, but then a plateau or a slower decrease compared to Rutherford. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe differential cross-section for Rutherford is dσ/dΩ ∝ 1/sin^4(θ/2). If there's screening, the cross-section is modified by a factor that depends on the momentum transfer. The screening introduces a cutoff in the momentum transfer, leading to a modification of the cross-section at small angles (which correspond to small momentum transfers). The cross-section would then decrease more rapidly at very small angles compared to Rutherford. So the angular distribution would still peak at θ=0 but not as strongly as Rutherford. The graph would show a peak at θ=0, then a rapid decrease, followed by a slower decrease at larger angles. Alternatively, maybe the cross-section is roughly constant at very small angles and then transitions to the Rutherford behavior.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the screening leads to a cross-section that is approximately flat at very small angles and then follows the Rutherford formula beyond a certain angle. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe another approach is to consider that the total cross-section is finite when screening is present, whereas pure Rutherford scattering has an infinite cross-section (because the integral over angles diverges at θ=0). So with screening, the cross-section is finite, and the angular distribution is modified such that the divergence at θ=0 is removed.\n\nIn any case, the problem asks what the angular distribution would look like. Since the proton energy is 1 keV, which is higher than the ionization energy, but the target is a hydrogen atom (neutral), the scattering is likely to be dominated by the Coulomb interaction with the screened nucleus. The angular distribution would resemble the Rutherford scattering at larger angles but with a suppression at very small angles due to screening. Therefore, the graph would have a peak in the forward direction (small angles), but the cross-section would be finite, and the distribution would fall off more steeply than Rutherford at very small angles. However, compared to pure Rutherford, which has an infinite cross-section at θ=0, the screened case would have a finite maximum at θ=0 and then decrease with angle.\n\nAlternatively, if the interaction is with a neutral atom, the leading interaction might be a dipole interaction because the atom is neutral but polarizable. The proton's charge induces a dipole moment in the hydrogen atom, leading to a potential proportional to 1/r². The scattering cross-section for a 1/r² potential is different from Coulomb. The differential cross-section for a 1/r² potential (like in polarization or dipole scattering) would have a different angular dependence. For example, the cross-section might be isotropic or have a different angular dependence.\n\nBut wait, the polarization potential (dipole) is V(r) ∝ -α e² / (2 r^4), where α is the polarizability. The hydrogen atom's polarizability is about 4.5e-41 C·m²/V². But the interaction energy would be V(r) = - (e^2 α)/(2 r^4). However, at 1 keV energy, the proton's kinetic energy is much larger than the typical polarization potential energy at the distance of closest approach. Let's estimate the distance of closest approach in a head-on collision. For Coulomb scattering, the distance of closest approach r_min is given by (for a head-on collision) r_min = (e²)/(4πε₀ K), where K is the kinetic energy. Wait, but here the target is a proton, so the Coulomb potential energy at closest approach is (e²)/(4πε₀ r_min) = K (since all kinetic energy is converted to potential energy at closest approach in a head-on collision). So solving for r_min: r_min = (e²)/(4πε₀ K). Plugging in the numbers: e = 1.6e-19 C, ε₀ = 8.85e-12 F/m, K = 1 keV = 1.6e-16 J. So r_min = ( (1.6e-19)^2 ) / (4π * 8.85e-12 * 1.6e-16 ) ≈ (2.56e-38) / (4π * 8.85e-12 * 1.6e-16 ) ≈ 2.56e-38 / (1.78e-26) ≈ 1.44e-12 meters, which is about 1.44 femtometers. This is much smaller than the Bohr radius (5.29e-11 m), so the proton comes very close to the nucleus, well within the electron cloud. Therefore, the screening by the electron is negligible at this distance. So the scattering is dominated by the unscreened Coulomb interaction with the nucleus. Therefore, the angular distribution should follow the Rutherford scattering formula.\n\nWait, but the target is a hydrogen atom, not a free proton. However, if the incoming proton comes within a distance much smaller than the Bohr radius, the electron's screening is irrelevant, and the scattering is effectively proton-proton Coulomb scattering. Therefore, the angular distribution would be the Rutherford scattering distribution, which is proportional to 1/sin^4(θ/2), leading to a sharp peak in the forward direction (small angles). However, Rutherford scattering cross-section diverges as θ approaches 0, but in reality, screening prevents this. However, in our case, since the distance of closest approach is much smaller than the Bohr radius, the screening by the electron occurs at much larger distances, so for scattering angles corresponding to impact parameters larger than the Bohr radius, the cross-section would be modified. But for impact parameters smaller than the Bohr radius (which correspond to larger scattering angles), the scattering is unscreened.\n\nTherefore, the angular distribution would have two regions: at small angles (large impact parameters), the cross-section is suppressed due to screening, and at larger angles (small impact parameters), the cross-section follows Rutherford. The transition angle θ_c can be estimated by relating the impact parameter to the Bohr radius. The impact parameter b is related to the scattering angle θ via the Rutherford formula: b = (e²)/(8πε₀ K) cot(θ/2). Setting b equal to the Bohr radius a_0, we can solve for θ_c:\n\na_0 = (e²)/(8πε₀ K) cot(θ_c/2)\n\nSolving for cot(θ_c/2) = (8πε₀ K a_0)/e²\n\nPlugging in the numbers: K = 1.6e-16 J, a_0 = 5.29e-11 m, e = 1.6e-19 C, ε₀ = 8.85e-12 F/m.\n\nCalculate numerator: 8π * 8.85e-12 * 1.6e-16 * 5.29e-11 ≈ 8 * 3.1416 * 8.85e-12 * 1.6e-16 * 5.29e-11 ≈ Let's compute step by step:\n\n8 * π ≈ 25.13\n\n25.13 * 8.85e-12 ≈ 2.22e-10\n\n2.22e-10 * 1.6e-16 ≈ 3.55e-26\n\n3.55e-26 * 5.29e-11 ≈ 1.88e-36\n\nDenominator: e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38\n\nSo cot(θ_c/2) = 1.88e-36 / 2.56e-38 ≈ 73.4\n\nTherefore, θ_c/2 ≈ arccot(73.4) ≈ arctan(1/73.4) ≈ 0.78 degrees. So θ_c ≈ 1.56 degrees.\n\nSo for angles larger than ~1.5 degrees, the impact parameter is smaller than the Bohr radius, and the scattering is unscreened Rutherford. For smaller angles, the impact parameter is larger than the Bohr radius, and the cross-section is suppressed due to screening. Therefore, the angular distribution would follow Rutherford (1/sin^4(θ/2)) for θ > θ_c and drop off more rapidly for θ < θ_c.\n\nTherefore, the graph of the differential cross-section vs. θ would show a sharp rise as θ approaches zero up to θ_c ≈ 1.5 degrees, then a decrease following the Rutherford formula for larger angles. However, in practice, the cross-section for θ < θ_c would be much lower than Rutherford, so the peak would be around θ_c, not at θ=0. Wait, no. Because for θ < θ_c, the cross-section is suppressed, so the differential cross-section would be lower than Rutherford at very small angles and then follow Rutherford beyond θ_c. So the graph would have a Rutherford-like behavior (steeply decreasing) starting from θ_c, but below θ_c, it's lower. Therefore, the peak would actually be at θ_c, but since θ_c is small (~1.5 degrees), the cross-section increases up to θ_c and then decreases for larger angles. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe Rutherford cross-section increases as θ decreases (diverges as θ approaches 0). But with screening, the cross-section is cut off below θ_c. So for θ < θ_c, the cross-section is lower than Rutherford, and for θ > θ_c, it follows Rutherford. Therefore, the differential cross-section would have a maximum at θ_c and decrease on both sides. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. The Rutherford cross-section dσ/dΩ is proportional to 1/sin^4(θ/2). If we have a cutoff at θ_c, then for θ < θ_c, the cross-section is lower, and for θ > θ_c, it follows Rutherford. So the graph would show that for angles below θ_c, the cross-section is lower than the Rutherford prediction, and for angles above θ_c, it matches Rutherford. Therefore, the angular distribution would have a Rutherford-like fall-off for angles above θ_c and a flatter or steeper fall-off below θ_c. The peak would still be at θ=0, but the cross-section is finite there due to screening. However, since the cross-section can't actually be infinite, the screening makes it finite at θ=0, and then it follows Rutherford beyond θ_c. So the graph would show a finite value at θ=0, then a rise to a maximum near θ_c, and then a decrease following Rutherford. Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me check with the formula.\n\nThe screened Coulomb potential (Yukawa potential) leads to a differential cross-section given by the Mott formula, which modifies the Rutherford formula by a factor. The differential cross-section is:\n\ndσ/dΩ ≈ ( (e^2 / (4πε₀))^2 ) / ( (4K sin²(θ/2) + ħ²/a_0² )^2 )\n\nBut I might be mixing up terms here. Alternatively, the screening can be approximated by introducing a cutoff impact parameter b_max ~ a_0. The differential cross-section is then given by the Rutherford formula for b < b_max and zero otherwise. But this is a rough approximation. The exact form would require integrating over the screened potential.\n\nAlternatively, the total cross-section can be estimated by integrating the Rutherford cross-section up to θ_c and then cutting off. But this is getting complicated.\n\nIn any case, the key point is that the angular distribution would resemble Rutherford scattering at angles larger than a certain critical angle (around a couple of degrees) and be suppressed at smaller angles due to screening by the electron. Therefore, the sketch should show a differential cross-section that peaks in the forward direction (small angles) but is finite at θ=0, then decreases with increasing angle, following the Rutherford 1/sin^4(θ/2) dependence beyond the critical angle. The graph would have a sharp peak near θ=0, then a rapid decrease, transitioning to a slower decrease at larger angles.\n\nFor part (a), the answer is that the angular distribution is peaked in the forward direction (small angles) with a shape similar to Rutherford scattering at larger angles but modified by screening effects at very small angles. The sketch would show a peak at θ=0, decreasing rapidly, then following the Rutherford trend for larger angles.\n\nNow moving to part (b), estimating the total cross-section. The total cross-section σ_total is the integral of the differential cross-section over all solid angles. For Rutherford scattering without screening, the integral diverges because of the singularity at θ=0. However, with screening, the cross-section becomes finite. The total cross-section can be estimated by considering the critical angle θ_c beyond which the cross-section follows Rutherford. Alternatively, the cross-section can be approximated as the area corresponding to the unscreened collisions, i.e., σ ≈ π b_max², where b_max is the maximum impact parameter for which the scattering is unscreened. Here, b_max is approximately the Bohr radius a_0, since beyond that, screening becomes effective.\n\nBut wait, earlier we found that the impact parameter corresponding to θ_c is b = a_0. So the cross-section would be σ ≈ π a_0². The Bohr radius a_0 is about 5.29e-11 meters. So σ ≈ π*(5.29e-11 m)^2 ≈ π*2.8e-21 m² ≈ 8.8e-21 m². Converting to cm²: 1 m² = 1e4 cm², so 8.8e-21 m² = 8.8e-17 cm². Alternatively, 1 barn = 1e-24 cm², so 8.8e-17 cm² = 8.8e7 barns. That's 88 million barns. But that seems very large. Wait, but the cross-section for proton-proton scattering at 1 keV would be given by the Rutherford formula, but with screening, the cross-section is cut off at b_max ~ a_0. However, the cross-section π a_0² is indeed a large value. Let's check the numbers:\n\na_0 = 5.29e-11 m\n\nπ*(5.29e-11)^2 = π*(2.8e-21) ≈ 8.8e-21 m² = 8.8e-17 cm² = 8.8e+7 barns (since 1 barn = 1e-24 cm², so 8.8e-17 cm² / 1e-24 cm²/barn = 8.8e7 barns). But typical nuclear cross-sections are on the order of barns (1e-24 cm²), so 88 million barns seems way too large. That suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the screening is not the right way to estimate the cross-section. Alternatively, since the proton's energy is 1 keV, which is low compared to relativistic energies but high compared to atomic binding energies, the cross-section might be dominated by the geometric cross-section of the hydrogen atom. The size of the hydrogen atom is the Bohr radius, so the cross-sectional area would be π a_0² ≈ 8.8e-17 cm² as before. But this is indeed a very large cross-section, but for atomic processes, cross-sections can be large. For example, the cross-section for ionization might be in that range. However, the problem asks for the total cross-section for scattering. But if the scattering is mostly due to the nucleus, then the cross-section should be similar to the proton-proton cross-section at 1 keV.\n\nWait, proton-proton scattering at low energies (non-relativistic) would have a Rutherford cross-section. The total cross-section for Rutherford scattering is infinite because of the divergence at θ=0. But with screening, the cross-section becomes finite. The screening length here is the Bohr radius. The total cross-section can be estimated by integrating the Rutherford differential cross-section from θ=θ_min to θ=π, where θ_min corresponds to the screening cutoff.\n\nThe differential cross-section for Rutherford scattering is:\n\ndσ/dΩ = ( (e^2)/(8πε₀ K) )² * 1/sin^4(θ/2)\n\nThe total cross-section is:\n\nσ = ∫ (dσ/dΩ) dΩ = ∫_0^{2π} dφ ∫_{θ_min}^π (dσ/dΩ) sinθ dθ\n\n= 2π * ( (e^2)/(8πε₀ K) )² ∫_{θ_min}^π sinθ / sin^4(θ/2) dθ\n\nLet’s make a substitution: let x = θ/2, so θ = 2x, dθ = 2dx, sinθ = 2 sinx cosx. The integral becomes:\n\n∫_{x_min}^{π/2} (2 sinx cosx) / sin^4x * 2 dx = ∫_{x_min}^{π/2} (4 cosx) / sin^3x dx\n\nLet’s compute this integral:\n\n∫ (4 cosx / sin^3x) dx = 4 ∫ cotx csc²x dx = 4 [ - (1/2) cot²x ] + C = -2 cot²x + C\n\nEvaluated from x_min to π/2:\n\nAt x = π/2, cotx = 0, so the term is 0. At x = x_min, it's -2 cot²x_min. So the integral is 2 cot²x_min.\n\nBut cotx_min = cosx_min / sinx_min. For small x_min (since θ_min is small), x_min ≈ θ_min/2 is small, so cotx_min ≈ 1/x_min. Therefore, cot²x_min ≈ 1/x_min². So the integral ≈ 2 / x_min².\n\nBut x_min is related to the screening angle. Earlier, we found θ_c ≈ 1.56 degrees, which is θ_c ≈ 0.027 radians. So x_min = θ_c/2 ≈ 0.0135 radians. Therefore, cotx_min ≈ 1/x_min ≈ 74, so cot²x_min ≈ 5476. Then the integral ≈ 2 * 5476 ≈ 10952.\n\nTherefore, the total cross-section is:\n\nσ = 2π * ( (e^2)/(8πε₀ K) )² * 10952\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, using the impact parameter approach, the maximum impact parameter b_max is the screening length (Bohr radius a_0). The total cross-section is σ = π b_max² = π a_0² ≈ 8.8e-17 cm² as before. But this gives a very large cross-section, which might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, the cross-section can be estimated using the classical scattering formula. The cross-section for scattering angles greater than a certain θ_min is σ = π b(θ_min)^2, where b(θ_min) is the impact parameter corresponding to θ_min. From the Rutherford formula, b = (e^2)/(8πε₀ K) cot(θ/2). For θ_min, we can set b_max = a_0, so:\n\na_0 = (e^2)/(8πε₀ K) cot(θ_min/2)\n\nSolving for cot(θ_min/2) = (8πε₀ K a_0)/e² ≈ 73.4 as before. Therefore, θ_min/2 ≈ arctan(1/73.4) ≈ 0.013 radians, so θ_min ≈ 0.026 radians (~1.5 degrees). Then the cross-section for θ > θ_min is σ = π b(θ_min)^2 = π (a_0)^2 ≈ 8.8e-17 cm². But this is the same as before.\n\nHowever, this cross-section seems too large. For comparison, the cross-section for proton-proton scattering at 1 keV without screening would be infinite, but with screening, it's finite. However, in reality, the hydrogen atom's electron does screen the proton's charge, but the cross-section might not be as large as the geometric cross-section of the atom. Another approach is to use the Mott cross-section, which includes the screening effect. The total cross-section can be approximated by σ ≈ (π e^4)/( (4πε₀)^2 K² ) * (1/ (1 + (2K a_0 / ħ^2))^2 )) ), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that at 1 keV, the de Broglie wavelength λ is about 9e-13 m, which is much smaller than the Bohr radius. Therefore, the wave nature is negligible, and classical scattering applies. The cross-section is dominated by scattering angles where the potential is significant. The cross-section can be estimated as the area where the potential energy is comparable to the kinetic energy. The potential energy at a distance r is V(r) = e^2/(4πε₀ r). Setting V(r) = K, we get r = e^2/(4πε₀ K). This is the same as the distance of closest approach in a head-on collision, which we calculated earlier as r_min ≈ 1.44e-12 m. The cross-section would then be σ ≈ π r_min² ≈ π*(1.44e-12 m)^2 ≈ 6.5e-24 m² = 6.5e-24 m² * (1e4 cm²/m²) = 6.5e-20 cm² = 6.5e4 barns. That's 65,000 barns. This is still a large cross-section but smaller than the previous estimate.\n\nBut which estimate is correct? The first approach using the Bohr radius gives 8.8e-17 cm² (88 million barns), the second using r_min gives 65,000 barns. These are vastly different. Which one is more plausible?\n\nThe total cross-section for proton-proton scattering at 1 keV, considering pure Coulomb scattering without screening, would have an infinite cross-section. But with screening by the electron, the cross-section becomes finite. The screening length is the Bohr radius. The cross-section should be on the order of the geometric cross-section corresponding to the screening length, which is π a_0² ≈ 8.8e-17 cm². However, this seems too large because typical nuclear cross-sections are much smaller. But this is an atomic cross-section, not nuclear. The hydrogen atom's size is much larger, so the cross-section for scattering could indeed be large. However, in reality, the cross-section for proton-hydrogen atom scattering at 1 keV might be dominated by charge transfer or other processes, but the problem specifies scattering, so we're considering elastic scattering.\n\nAlternatively, another way to estimate the cross-section is to use the concept of the stopping power or the Bethe formula, but that's more for energy loss. Alternatively, the cross-section can be estimated using the classical scattering formula with the screening length. The cross-section is given by σ = π (e^2/(4πε₀ K))^2 * (1/ ( (a_0)^2 + (e^2/(4πε₀ K))^2 )) ). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the screening length is a_0, and the effective interaction is such that for r < a_0, the potential is Coulomb, and for r > a_0, it's screened. The cross-section would then be the area for r < a_0, which is π a_0². But this leads to the large cross-section of 8.8e-17 cm². However, this seems inconsistent with typical values. For example, the cross-section for electron scattering off a hydrogen atom is on the order of 1e-16 cm² for eV energies. But protons are heavier, so maybe the cross-section is similar.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the proton's kinetic energy is 1 keV, which is much higher than the atomic binding energy, the collision time is very short, so the adiabatic approximation applies, and the electron doesn't have time to respond. Therefore, the proton scatters off the nucleus as if the electron weren't there. But the hydrogen atom is neutral, so the incoming proton would see a neutral charge at large distances. However, at close distances, it sees the nucleus. The cross-section would then be similar to proton-proton scattering but with a cutoff at large impact parameters due to screening.\n\nThe unscreened proton-proton cross-section at 1 keV using the Rutherford formula would have a differential cross-section, but the total cross-section is infinite. However, with screening, the maximum impact parameter is the Bohr radius. Therefore, the total cross-section is σ = π a_0² ≈ 8.8e-17 cm² ≈ 8.8e+7 barns. This is a possible answer, but I need to check if this makes sense.\n\nAnother approach: the cross-section for ionization of hydrogen by a proton.

{"id": "atomic/2-20", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the upper and lower limits for the elastic scattering cross section of neutrons incident on a carbon target, given that the inelastic cross section is 400×10⁻²⁴ cm². The neutrons have a kinetic energy of 1000 eV. Hmm, let me think about how cross sections work here.\n\nFirst, I remember that the total cross section is the sum of all possible cross sections: elastic, inelastic, absorption, etc. But in this case, the problem only mentions elastic and inelastic. Maybe absorption is negligible here? Or maybe we're supposed to assume that the total cross section is just the sum of elastic and inelastic. Wait, but how do I find the limits for the elastic cross section without knowing the total?\n\nOh, right! The maximum possible elastic cross section would be when there's no other processes except elastic and inelastic, and the elastic is as large as possible. But wait, the total cross section can't be determined here. Wait, maybe there's another approach.\n\nWait, maybe the principle of detailed balance or something else? Or perhaps the optical theorem? Hmm. Wait, the optical theorem relates the total cross section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. But I don't think we have information about the scattering amplitude here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the sum of all partial cross sections can't exceed the total cross section. But without knowing the total cross section, how can we set limits?\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is simpler. Since the inelastic cross section is given, and the elastic cross section can't be negative. So the elastic cross section must be greater than or equal to zero, but how does that relate to the upper limit?\n\nWait, but maybe there's a relation between elastic and inelastic cross sections based on unitarity. The unitarity condition in scattering theory imposes that the sum of all cross sections (elastic + inelastic) can't exceed a certain value. Wait, but unitarity is more about the partial wave amplitudes. For a given partial wave, the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude can't exceed 1. But I'm not sure how to apply that here directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum possible elastic cross section occurs when the scattering is purely elastic and inelastic, and the elastic cross section is as large as possible given the inelastic. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum elastic cross section would be when the total cross section is the sum of elastic and inelastic, and the elastic can't be more than the total. But without knowing the total cross section, how can we proceed?\n\nWait, maybe there's another approach. For neutrons scattering off a nucleus like carbon, the cross sections can be influenced by resonance phenomena. But at 1000 eV, which is 1 keV, the energy is relatively low. Carbon-12 has a low mass, so the neutron interactions might be in the thermal or epithermal range. Wait, 1 keV is actually in the epithermal range. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to use the fact that the sum of the elastic and inelastic cross sections can't exceed the maximum possible cross section given by the geometrical cross section of the nucleus. The geometrical cross section is πR², where R is the radius of the carbon nucleus. Let's calculate that. The radius of a nucleus is given by R = r₀ A^(1/3), where r₀ is approximately 1.2 fm and A is the mass number. For carbon-12, A=12. So R ≈ 1.2 × 12^(1/3) fm. 12^(1/3) is about 2.289, so R ≈ 1.2 × 2.289 ≈ 2.75 fm. Then the geometrical cross section is π*(2.75 fm)². Let's convert that to cm². 1 fm = 1e-15 m = 1e-13 cm. So 2.75 fm = 2.75e-13 cm. Then the area is π*(2.75e-13 cm)^2 ≈ 3.1416 * 7.56e-26 cm² ≈ 2.37e-25 cm². But the given inelastic cross section is 400e-24 cm², which is 4e-22 cm². Wait, that's way larger than the geometrical cross section. That can't be right. So maybe that approach is wrong.\n\nWait, that suggests that the inelastic cross section given is much larger than the geometrical cross section. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in units. Let me check again. The inelastic cross section is 400×10⁻²⁴ cm². That's 4×10⁻²² cm². The geometrical cross section I calculated was 2.37e-25 cm². So the inelastic cross section is about 1.7 times larger than the geometrical cross section. Hmm, but cross sections can be larger than the geometrical cross section due to quantum effects, resonance, etc. For example, in resonance scattering, the cross section can be much larger. So maybe that's possible.\n\nBut how does that help me find the elastic cross section limits? If the total cross section (elastic + inelastic) can't be more than some value, but if the inelastic is already given, then the elastic can't be more than (total_max - inelastic). But without knowing the total_max, perhaps we can use the fact that the elastic cross section can't be negative, so the lower limit is zero. But the upper limit would be when the total cross section is as large as possible. But how large can the total cross section be?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to recall that the maximum possible cross section for a given partial wave is given by (4π/k²)(2l+1), where k is the wave number. But for neutrons of 1000 eV, let's calculate the wave number. The kinetic energy E = 1000 eV. The neutron mass is about 939 MeV/c². So E = 1000 eV = 1 keV. The momentum p = sqrt(2mE). Let's compute that. m = 939e6 eV/c². E = 1e3 eV. So p = sqrt(2 * 939e6 eV/c² * 1e3 eV) = sqrt(1.878e12 eV²/c²) = 1.37e6 eV/c. Then the wave number k = p/(ℏc). Wait, ℏc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. So converting eV to MeV: 1.37e6 eV = 1.37 MeV. So k = (1.37 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) = 1.37 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.00694 fm⁻¹. Then k ≈ 0.00694 fm⁻¹ = 6.94e-3 fm⁻¹. Since 1 fm = 1e-13 cm, so k in cm⁻¹ is 6.94e-3 / (1e-13 cm) ) = 6.94e10 cm⁻¹. Then 4π/k² would be 4π/( (6.94e10 cm⁻¹)^2 ) ≈ 4*3.1416 / (4.82e21 cm⁻² ) ≈ 12.566 / 4.82e21 ≈ 2.61e-21 cm². But the given inelastic cross section is 4e-22 cm², which is smaller than this maximum. So the maximum possible cross section for s-wave (l=0) would be 4π/k² ≈ 2.6e-21 cm². So if the total cross section can't exceed this, then the elastic cross section can't exceed (2.6e-21 - 4e-22) cm². Let's compute that: 2.6e-21 - 0.4e-21 = 2.2e-21 cm². But this seems like a possible upper limit. However, this approach might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Since cross sections can vary, but the elastic cross section can't be negative. So the lower limit is zero. The upper limit would be unbounded unless there's a constraint. But given that the inelastic cross section is 4e-22 cm², and the total cross section is elastic + inelastic. However, without knowing the total cross section, perhaps the only constraint is that elastic cross section must be non-negative, so lower limit is zero, and upper limit is unbounded. But that can't be right. The problem must have a standard approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that the elastic cross section can range from 0 up to any value, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the fact that the sum of elastic and inelastic cross sections can't exceed the total cross section, which is measured. But since we don't have the total cross section, perhaps the only constraints are that elastic must be non-negative, so lower limit is 0, and upper limit is infinity. But that seems unlikely. The problem must have a specific method.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting me to use the optical theorem. The optical theorem states that the total cross section is related to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude: σ_total = (4π/k) Im[f(0)], where f(0) is the forward scattering amplitude. But without knowing f(0), this might not help. However, if we assume that the elastic cross section is given by σ_elastic = ∫ |f(θ)|² dΩ, and the inelastic cross section is σ_inelastic, then σ_total = σ_elastic + σ_inelastic. The optical theorem relates σ_total to Im[f(0)]. But unless we have more information about f(θ), we can't proceed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that for any scattering process, the elastic cross section can't exceed the total cross section. But since σ_total = σ_elastic + σ_inelastic, then σ_elastic = σ_total - σ_inelastic. But without knowing σ_total, we can't find σ_elastic. However, perhaps there's a maximum possible σ_total based on some physical principle. For example, the maximum cross section for a given partial wave is (4π/k²)(2l+1). If we assume that only s-waves (l=0) contribute, then the maximum σ_total would be 4π/k². Then σ_elastic ≤ 4π/k² - σ_inelastic. But earlier calculation gave 4π/k² ≈ 2.6e-21 cm². Then σ_elastic ≤ 2.6e-21 - 4e-22 = 2.2e-21 cm². But this is a possible upper limit. However, this is speculative. The problem might expect this approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Since the inelastic cross section is given, and the elastic cross section can't be negative, the lower limit is zero. For the upper limit, since cross sections can add, but there's no upper bound unless specified. But the problem states \"what upper and lower limits can you place\", implying that there's a standard way to find these limits with the given information. Maybe using the fact that the total cross section must be at least as large as the inelastic cross section, so the elastic can be zero (lower limit) and the upper limit is when the total cross section is dominated by elastic, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that the elastic cross section must be between 0 and infinity, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the sum of elastic and inelastic can't exceed the maximum cross section given by the optical theorem. But without knowing the forward scattering amplitude, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the use of the principle that the elastic cross section can't be less than the square of the amplitude, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is a trick question. Since the inelastic cross section is given, and the elastic cross section can be anything from zero upwards, the lower limit is zero and the upper limit is unbounded. But the problem says \"what upper and lower limits can you place\", so maybe the answer is that the elastic cross section σ_elastic ≥ 0, so lower limit 0, upper limit unbounded. But that seems too trivial. Maybe there's another consideration.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is referring to the fact that for a given nucleus and energy, the sum of the cross sections can't exceed a certain value based on the interaction time or something else. But I don't recall such a principle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the use of the single-channel or multi-channel scattering. If the inelastic channel is open, then the elastic cross section has a maximum given by the unitarity limit. For example, in the case of potential scattering with absorption (which would correspond to inelastic processes), the maximum elastic cross section is when there's no absorption, and the minimum is when absorption is maximum. Wait, this might be the key. \n\nIn scattering theory, when you have a complex potential, the absorption represents inelastic channels. The elastic cross section can be written in terms of the phase shift with an imaginary part. The maximum elastic cross section occurs when there's no absorption (purely elastic), but if there's absorption (inelastic), then the elastic cross section is reduced. The optical model often uses this approach. \n\nFor a partial wave, the elastic cross section is σ_elastic = (π/k²) |1 - S|², where S is the S-matrix element. If there's absorption, S = η e^{2iδ}, where η ≤ 1 (η is the inelasticity parameter). The inelastic cross section for that partial wave is σ_inelastic = (π/k²)(1 - η²). So for a given σ_inelastic, we can solve for η. Then the elastic cross section would be σ_elastic = (π/k²) |1 - η e^{2iδ}|². To find the maximum and minimum elastic cross sections, we need to consider the possible values of δ. \n\nBut this might be too involved. Let's consider s-wave scattering (l=0) only. Then the S-matrix element S = η e^{2iδ}. The elastic cross section is σ_elastic = (π/k²) |1 - S|² = (π/k²)(1 + |S|² - 2 Re(S)). Since S = η e^{2iδ}, |S|² = η², and Re(S) = η cos(2δ). So σ_elastic = (π/k²)(1 + η² - 2 η cos(2δ)). The inelastic cross section is σ_inelastic = (π/k²)(1 - η²). \n\nGiven σ_inelastic = 400e-24 cm², we can solve for η. Let's compute (π/k²)(1 - η²) = 4e-22 cm². From earlier, π/k² ≈ 2.6e-21 / 4 ≈ 6.5e-22 cm² (since 4π/k² ≈ 2.6e-21). Wait, no: earlier I calculated 4π/k² ≈ 2.6e-21 cm², so π/k² ≈ 6.5e-22 cm². So (π/k²)(1 - η²) = 4e-22 cm². Plugging in π/k² ≈ 6.5e-22 cm², we get 6.5e-22 (1 - η²) = 4e-22. Then 1 - η² = (4e-22)/(6.5e-22) ≈ 0.615. So η² ≈ 1 - 0.615 = 0.385, so η ≈ sqrt(0.385) ≈ 0.62. \n\nNow, the elastic cross section is σ_elastic = (π/k²)(1 + η² - 2 η cos(2δ)). The maximum and minimum values of this occur when cos(2δ) is varied. The term -2 η cos(2δ) can range from -2η to +2η. Therefore, the maximum σ_elastic occurs when cos(2δ) = -1, giving 1 + η² + 2η. The minimum occurs when cos(2δ) = +1, giving 1 + η² - 2η. \n\nSo substituting η ≈ 0.62:\n\nMaximum σ_elastic = (π/k²)(1 + 0.385 + 2*0.62) = (π/k²)(1 + 0.385 + 1.24) = (π/k²)(2.625) ≈ 6.5e-22 cm² * 2.625 ≈ 1.706e-21 cm².\n\nMinimum σ_elastic = (π/k²)(1 + 0.385 - 1.24) = (π/k²)(0.145) ≈ 6.5e-22 * 0.145 ≈ 9.425e-23 cm².\n\nBut wait, the given inelastic cross section is 4e-22 cm², which we used to find η. Then the elastic cross section can vary between approximately 9.4e-23 cm² and 1.7e-21 cm². However, these values are specific to s-wave scattering. If higher partial waves contribute, the cross section could be larger. But assuming s-wave dominance at low energies (1 keV might be low enough for s-wave to dominate), these would be the limits.\n\nBut converting these numbers to the units given (400×10⁻²⁴ cm² = 4e-22 cm²), the elastic cross section would have a lower limit of ~9.4e-23 cm² = 94×10⁻²⁴ cm² and upper limit of ~1.7e-21 cm² = 1700×10⁻²⁴ cm². \n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the upper and lower limits based on the given inelastic cross section. So according to this calculation, the elastic cross section can range from approximately 94×10⁻²⁴ cm² to 1700×10⁻²⁴ cm². But I need to check if this approach is valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a simpler answer. Since the inelastic cross section is given, and the elastic can't be negative, the lower limit is zero. The upper limit would be when the total cross section is just the sum of elastic and inelastic, but without any other constraints, the elastic could be anything. However, using the unitarity condition from partial wave analysis gives more precise limits. \n\nGiven that the problem is from a physics exam, the expected answer is likely based on the unitarity condition for s-wave scattering, leading to the elastic cross section having a minimum value greater than zero. Therefore, the lower limit is not zero but derived from the inelastic cross section. \n\nBut in the calculation above, the minimum elastic cross section was found to be ~9.4e-23 cm², which is 94×10⁻²⁴ cm², and the maximum is ~1700×10⁻²⁴ cm². However, the given inelastic cross section is 400×10⁻²⁴ cm². So the answer would be that the elastic cross section lies between approximately 94 and 1700 barns (1 barn = 1e-24 cm²). \n\nBut I need to verify the calculations again. Let's redo the steps:\n\n1. Calculate k for 1000 eV neutrons.\n2. Compute π/k².\n3. Use the given inelastic cross section to find η.\n4. Compute the maximum and minimum elastic cross sections based on η.\n\nStep 1: Kinetic energy E = 1000 eV = 1 keV. Neutron mass m = 939.565 MeV/c² ≈ 939.565e6 eV/c².\n\nMomentum p = sqrt(2mE) = sqrt(2 * 939.565e6 eV/c² * 1e3 eV) = sqrt(1.879e12 eV²/c²) = 1.371e6 eV/c.\n\nWave number k = p/ℏ = (1.371e6 eV/c) / (197.33e6 eV·fm/c) ) ≈ 1.371e6 / 1.9733e8 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.00695 fm⁻¹.\n\nConvert k to cm⁻¹: 1 fm⁻¹ = 1e13 cm⁻¹, so k = 0.00695 fm⁻¹ = 6.95e3 cm⁻¹. Wait, no: 1 fm = 1e-13 cm, so 1 fm⁻¹ = 1e13 cm⁻¹. Therefore, k = 0.00695 fm⁻¹ = 0.00695 * 1e13 cm⁻¹ = 6.95e10 cm⁻¹. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, k in fm⁻¹ is 0.00695 fm⁻¹. To convert to cm⁻¹, since 1 fm = 1e-13 cm, 1 fm⁻¹ = 1e13 cm⁻¹. Therefore, k = 0.00695 fm⁻¹ = 0.00695 * 1e13 cm⁻¹ = 6.95e10 cm⁻¹. Then k² = (6.95e10)^2 = 4.83e21 cm⁻².\n\nThen π/k² = 3.1416 / 4.83e21 ≈ 6.5e-22 cm². \n\nStep 3: σ_inelastic = (π/k²)(1 - η²) = 4e-22 cm². So 6.5e-22 (1 - η²) = 4e-22 → 1 - η² ≈ 4/6.5 ≈ 0.6154 → η² ≈ 0.3846 → η ≈ 0.62.\n\nStep 4: σ_elastic_max = (π/k²)(1 + η² + 2η) = 6.5e-22 * (1 + 0.3846 + 2*0.62) = 6.5e-22 * (1 + 0.3846 + 1.24) = 6.5e-22 * 2.6246 ≈ 1.706e-21 cm² = 1706e-24 cm².\n\nσ_elastic_min = (π/k²)(1 + η² - 2η) = 6.5e-22 * (1 + 0.3846 - 1.24) = 6.5e-22 * 0.1446 ≈ 9.4e-23 cm² = 94e-24 cm².\n\nTherefore, the elastic cross section must be between approximately 94×10⁻²⁴ cm² and 1706×10⁻²⁴ cm². \n\nBut the problem states the inelastic cross section is 400×10⁻²⁴ cm². So the answer is that the elastic cross section lies between 94×10⁻²⁴ cm² and 1706×10⁻²⁴ cm². Rounding these numbers, maybe 90 and 1700. \n\nBut let me check the calculation again for accuracy. \n\nGiven η ≈ 0.62, then:\n\nFor maximum elastic cross section:\n\n1 + η² + 2η = 1 + 0.3844 + 1.24 = 2.6244. Multiply by π/k² ≈ 6.5e-22 cm²: 2.6244 * 6.5e-22 ≈ 17.06e-22 cm² = 1.706e-21 cm² = 1706e-24 cm².\n\nFor minimum:\n\n1 + η² - 2η = 1 + 0.3844 - 1.24 = 0.1444. 0.1444 * 6.5e-22 ≈ 0.9386e-22 cm² ≈ 9.386e-23 cm² = 93.86e-24 cm² ≈ 94e-24 cm².\n\nSo the limits are approximately 94e-24 cm² to 1706e-24 cm². \n\nTherefore, the elastic scattering cross section must be between these values. So the upper limit is about 1700×10⁻²⁴ cm² and the lower limit is about 94×10⁻²⁴ cm². \n\nBut the problem might expect the answer in terms of these calculated values. However, perhaps the question assumes that the maximum elastic cross section is when the total cross section is 4π/k², so σ_elastic_max = 4π/k² - σ_inelastic. Let's check that. \n\nEarlier, 4π/k² ≈ 2.6e-21 cm². Then σ_elastic_max = 2.6e-21 - 4e-22 = 2.2e-21 cm² = 2200e-24 cm². But this contradicts the previous calculation. Which is correct?\n\nWait, the previous approach using the partial wave analysis gives a maximum elastic cross section of ~1700e-24 cm², while the simple subtraction gives 2200e-24 cm². The discrepancy arises because the partial wave approach considers the interference term (the -2η cos(2δ)), which can add or subtract. The maximum occurs when cos(2δ) = -1, leading to maximum addition. However, the 4π/k² is the maximum possible total cross section for s-wave scattering (when η=1, purely elastic). But if there's inelastic scattering (η < 1), then the total cross section is σ_total = σ_elastic + σ_inelastic = (π/k²)(2(1 - η cos(2δ))) + (π/k²)(1 - η²). Wait, this might not be the right way to sum them. Let me re-express.\n\nFrom the partial wave analysis:\n\nσ_elastic = (π/k²) |1 - S|² = (π/k²)(1 + |S|² - 2 Re(S)).\n\nσ_inelastic = (π/k²)(1 - |S|²).\n\nSo σ_total = σ_elastic + σ_inelastic = (π/k²)(1 + |S|² - 2 Re(S) + 1 - |S|²) = (π/k²)(2 - 2 Re(S)).\n\nBut S = η e^{2iδ}, so Re(S) = η cos(2δ). Therefore, σ_total = (2π/k²)(1 - η cos(2δ)).\n\nThe maximum σ_total occurs when cos(2δ) = -1, giving σ_total_max = (2π/k²)(1 + η). The minimum σ_total occurs when cos(2δ) = +1, giving σ_total_min = (2π/k²)(1 - η).\n\nBut given that σ_inelastic = (π/k²)(1 - η²), and we have η ≈ 0.62, then:\n\nσ_total_max = (2π/k²)(1 + η) ≈ 2*6.5e-22*(1 + 0.62) ≈ 13e-22*1.62 ≈ 21.06e-22 cm² = 2.106e-21 cm².\n\nσ_total_min = (2π/k²)(1 - η) ≈ 13e-22*(1 - 0.62) ≈ 13e-22*0.38 ≈ 4.94e-22 cm².\n\nBut the given σ_inelastic is 4e-22 cm², which is close to σ_total_min. Wait, but σ_inelastic is fixed. So the variation in σ_elastic comes from the variation in δ, which affects the elastic cross section but not the inelastic (since σ_inelastic depends only on η). Therefore, the elastic cross section can vary between the calculated min and max based on δ, while σ_inelastic remains fixed. \n\nThus, the correct limits are indeed approximately 94e-24 cm² and 1706e-24 cm². Therefore, the answer should be that the elastic cross section lies between these values. \n\nBut the problem might expect rounding to two significant figures, so lower limit ~90e-24 cm² and upper limit ~1700e-24 cm². \n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect the answer to recognize that the minimum elastic cross section is (sqrt(σ_inelastic) - sqrt(σ_inelastic))^2 = 0, but that doesn't make sense. No, the correct approach is the partial wave analysis with unitarity constraints. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is that the elastic cross section must be between approximately 90×10⁻²⁴ cm² and 1700×10⁻²⁴ cm². So the upper limit is 1700×10⁻²⁴ cm² and the lower limit is 90×10⁻²⁴ cm².\n</think>\n\nThe elastic scattering cross section for neutrons incident on carbon with 1000 eV kinetic energy can be bounded using the given inelastic cross section and principles of partial wave analysis. \n\n1. **Wave Number Calculation**:  \n   The wave number \\( k \\) is determined from the neutron's kinetic energy.

{"id": "atomic/2-8", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the density of nuclear matter in tons per cubic centimeter. Hmm, I remember that nuclear matter is super dense, way more than ordinary matter. Let me think. I recall that the typical density of a nucleus is around 10^17 kg/m³. Wait, but converting that to tons per cm³ might be tricky. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's start with the standard density of nuclear matter. I think the approximate value is about 2.3 x 10^17 kg/m³. Let me confirm that. Yeah, the nuclear density is roughly constant for all nuclei, around that number. So, 2.3e17 kg/m³. Now, I need to convert kilograms to tons and cubic meters to cubic centimeters.\n\nOkay, 1 ton is 1000 kg, right? So, to convert kg to tons, divide by 1000. Then, 1 m³ is equal to 1e6 cm³? Wait, no. Wait, 1 meter is 100 cm, so 1 cubic meter is (100 cm)^3 = 1,000,000 cm³, which is 1e6 cm³. Wait, no, wait: 100 cm in a meter, so cubic is 100^3 = 1,000,000 cm³ per m³. So, 1 m³ = 1e6 cm³. Therefore, to convert kg/m³ to tons/cm³, we need to divide by 1000 (kg to tons) and divide by 1e6 (m³ to cm³). So total conversion factor is 1/(1000 * 1e6) = 1e-9.\n\nSo, starting with 2.3e17 kg/m³. Multiply by 1e-9 to get tons/cm³. Let's compute that. 2.3e17 * 1e-9 = 2.3e8 tons/cm³. Wait, but that's 230 million tons per cm³. But the options given are 0.004, 400, or 1e9. Hmm, 2.3e8 is 230,000,000, which is 2.3 x 10^8. But the options are (c) 1e9. Hmm, maybe my initial value is off. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the standard nuclear density is 3e17 kg/m³? Let me recall. The formula for nuclear density is approximately mass number A divided by volume (which is (4/3)πr³, and r is r0 A^(1/3), where r0 is about 1.2 fm). So the volume is proportional to A, so density (mass/volume) would be (A * u)/( (4/3)π (r0 A^(1/3))^3 ) ) = (A u)/( (4/3 π r0^3 A) ) ) = 3u/(4 π r0^3). Since u is the atomic mass unit, approximately 1.66e-27 kg. Let's compute that.\n\nr0 is 1.2e-15 m. So r0^3 is (1.2e-15)^3 = 1.728e-45 m³. Then 4/3 π r0^3 is 4/3 * π * 1.728e-45 ≈ 7.23e-45 m³. Then 3u/(4 π r0^3) would be 3 * 1.66e-27 kg / (7.23e-45 m³) ≈ (4.98e-27) / (7.23e-45) ≈ 6.89e17 kg/m³. Oh, so maybe the density is closer to 6.9e17 kg/m³. That's higher than my initial thought. So maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nSo if it's 6.9e17 kg/m³, then converting to tons/cm³. Again, 1 ton = 1000 kg, so divide by 1000. 1 m³ = 1e6 cm³. So 6.9e17 kg/m³ = 6.9e17 / 1000 tons/m³ = 6.9e14 tons/m³. Then per cm³, divide by 1e6 (since 1 m³ = 1e6 cm³). So 6.9e14 / 1e6 = 6.9e8 tons/cm³. That's 6.9 x 10^8 tons/cm³. Hmm, but the options are 0.004, 400, 1e9. So 6.9e8 is 690 million, which is closer to 1e9 (option c). But maybe the approximation is 1e9. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the standard value is taken as 1e17 kg/m³. Let's see. If I take 1e17 kg/m³. Then converting: 1e17 kg/m³ = 1e17 / 1000 tons/m³ = 1e14 tons/m³. Then per cm³, divide by 1e6: 1e14 / 1e6 = 1e8 tons/cm³. That's 100 million. Still not 1e9. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the conversion factors.\n\nWait, let me recheck the conversion. 1 kg = 0.001 tons. So 1 kg/m³ = 0.001 tons/m³. Then 1 m³ = 1e6 cm³. So 1 kg/m³ = 0.001 tons / 1e6 cm³ = 1e-9 tons/cm³. Therefore, to convert kg/m³ to tons/cm³, multiply by 1e-9. So if the density is 2e17 kg/m³, then 2e17 * 1e-9 = 2e8 tons/cm³. Which is 200 million tons/cm³. But none of the options match. The options are (c) 1e9. Hmm. Maybe the initial density is higher?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the nuclear density. Let me recalculate using the formula. The nuclear density is given by:\n\ndensity = (mass of nucleus) / (volume of nucleus)\n\nAssuming the nucleus is a sphere with radius r = r0 A^(1/3), where r0 ≈ 1.2 fm = 1.2e-15 m.\n\nThe mass of the nucleus is approximately A * u, where u is the atomic mass unit, 1.6605e-27 kg.\n\nSo, density = (A * u) / ( (4/3) π r^3 )\n\nBut since r = r0 A^(1/3), then r^3 = r0^3 A.\n\nTherefore, density = (A * u) / ( (4/3) π r0^3 A ) ) = (3 u) / (4 π r0^3 )\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nu = 1.6605e-27 kg\n\nr0 = 1.2e-15 m\n\nSo,\n\ndensity = 3 * 1.6605e-27 / (4 * π * (1.2e-15)^3 )\n\nCalculate denominator:\n\n(1.2e-15)^3 = 1.728e-45 m³\n\nMultiply by 4π: 4 * π * 1.728e-45 ≈ 21.699e-45 ≈ 2.1699e-44\n\nSo denominator is 2.1699e-44 m³\n\nNumerator: 3 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 4.9815e-27 kg\n\nSo density ≈ 4.9815e-27 / 2.1699e-44 ≈ 2.3e17 kg/m³\n\nSo that's 2.3e17 kg/m³. Then converting to tons/cm³:\n\nMultiply by 1e-9 (since 1 kg/m³ = 1e-9 tons/cm³)\n\nSo 2.3e17 * 1e-9 = 2.3e8 tons/cm³. That's 230 million tons per cm³. But the options given are (c) 1e9. Hmm. So there's a discrepancy here. Maybe the question uses a different approximation? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the density of neutron star matter, which is even higher, but the question says \"nuclear matter\", which should be the standard nuclear density.\n\nWait, maybe the options are in tons per cubic centimeter, but perhaps the original value is in metric tons. Let me check. 1 metric ton is 1000 kg. So that's correct. So the calculation seems right. But the answer I get is 2.3e8 tons/cm³, which is 230,000,000 tons/cm³. The closest option given is (c) 1e9, which is 1,000,000,000. Hmm, but 2.3e8 is 2.3 x 10^8, which is 230 million, which is an order of magnitude less than 1e9. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem options, or perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me check the conversion again. 1 kg/m³ to tons/cm³:\n\n1 kg = 0.001 tons\n\n1 m³ = 1e6 liters = 1e6 dm³. Wait, no, 1 m³ is 1e3 liters, and 1 liter is 1 dm³. Wait, no, 1 m³ = 1000 liters. But we need to convert to cm³. 1 m³ = (100 cm)^3 = 1,000,000 cm³. So 1 m³ = 1e6 cm³. Therefore, 1 kg/m³ = 0.001 tons / 1e6 cm³ = 1e-9 tons/cm³. So yes, the conversion factor is 1e-9. So 2.3e17 kg/m³ * 1e-9 = 2.3e8 tons/cm³. So that's correct.\n\nBut the options don't have 2.3e8. The closest is (c) 1e9. So maybe the question approximates the nuclear density as 1e18 kg/m³, which would give 1e9 tons/cm³. But why would they do that? Alternatively, maybe the question uses a different value for r0. For example, if r0 is taken as 1.0 fm instead of 1.2 fm, then the density would be higher. Let's try that.\n\nIf r0 is 1.0e-15 m, then r0^3 = 1e-45 m³. Then denominator is 4/3 π * 1e-45 ≈ 4.188e-45. Then density is 3 * 1.66e-27 / 4.188e-45 ≈ (4.98e-27) / (4.188e-45) ≈ 1.19e18 kg/m³. Then converting to tons/cm³: 1.19e18 * 1e-9 = 1.19e9 tons/cm³. That's approximately 1e9, which matches option (c). So maybe the question uses r0 = 1.0 fm instead of 1.2 fm. But the standard value for r0 is about 1.2 fm. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different approximation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the density of a neutron star, which is much higher, but that's not nuclear matter. Nuclear matter is the density inside atomic nuclei, which is around 2e17 kg/m³. But if the problem states the answer is 1e9 tons/cm³, then perhaps there's a mistake in the problem options. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, let me check the calculation again. Let's compute the density step by step:\n\ndensity = 3u / (4π r0³)\n\nu = 1.6605e-27 kg\n\nr0 = 1.2e-15 m\n\nSo:\n\n3 * 1.6605e-27 = 4.9815e-27 kg\n\n4π*(1.2e-15)^3 = 4π*(1.728e-45) = 6.902e-45 m³\n\nSo density = 4.9815e-27 / 6.902e-45 ≈ 7.217e17 kg/m³\n\nWait, wait, this is different from before. Wait, 4π*(1.2e-15)^3: 1.2^3 is 1.728, so 1.728e-45 m³. Multiply by 4π: 4 * 3.1416 * 1.728e-45 ≈ 21.7e-45 = 2.17e-44 m³. Wait, no, 4π*(1.2e-15)^3 = 4π*(1.728e-45) ≈ 4 * 3.1416 * 1.728e-45 ≈ 21.7e-45 = 2.17e-44 m³. Then 3u/(4πr0³) = 3*1.66e-27 / 2.17e-44 ≈ (4.98e-27)/(2.17e-44) ≈ 2.3e17 kg/m³. So that's correct. So density is 2.3e17 kg/m³. Converting to tons/cm³: 2.3e17 * 1e-9 = 2.3e8 tons/cm³. So 230 million tons per cm³. But the options are 0.004, 400, 1e9. None of these match. So perhaps the question is incorrect, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the density in tons per cubic centimeter, but using short tons instead of metric tons? Wait, but the problem uses the symbol \"ton\", which is ambiguous. In metric system, 1 ton is 1000 kg, but in US tons, 1 short ton is 907.18474 kg. But that would only change the result by about 10%, which wouldn't bridge the gap between 2.3e8 and 1e9. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question made a mistake in the exponent. If the answer is 2.3e8, but the options are 0.004, 400, 1e9, then none match. But perhaps the intended answer is (c) 1e9, assuming that the density is approximated as 1e17 kg/m³, which would give 1e8 tons/cm³, but that's still not 1e9. Wait, maybe the original value is 1e18 kg/m³. If the density is 1e18 kg/m³, then 1e18 * 1e-9 = 1e9 tons/cm³. So that would match option (c). But why would the density be 1e18 kg/m³? That's higher than the standard nuclear density. Unless there's a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the density of a proton or a neutron. But the density of a proton would be similar to nuclear density. Wait, no, the proton is a part of the nucleus. The nuclear density is already taking into account the protons and neutrons.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different value for r0. For example, if r0 is taken as 1.0 fm instead of 1.2 fm, then the density would be higher. Let's try that. If r0 = 1.0e-15 m, then:\n\ndensity = 3u/(4πr0³) = 3*1.66e-27 / (4π*(1e-15)^3) = 4.98e-27 / (4π*1e-45) ≈ 4.98e-27 / 1.2566e-44 ≈ 3.96e17 kg/m³. Then converting to tons/cm³: 3.96e17 * 1e-9 = 3.96e8 tons/cm³. Still around 4e8, which is 400 million, not 1e9. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the question is using a different approximation for the nuclear radius. For example, sometimes the radius is given as r = 1.25 A^(1/3) fm. Let's try with r0 = 1.25 fm. Then r0^3 = (1.25)^3 = 1.953125 fm³. Then denominator is 4π*(1.25e-15)^3 ≈ 4π*1.953e-45 ≈ 2.45e-44 m³. Then density = 3*1.66e-27 / 2.45e-44 ≈ 4.98e-27 / 2.45e-44 ≈ 2.03e17 kg/m³. Converting to tons/cm³: 2.03e17 *1e-9 = 2.03e8. Still around 2e8.\n\nI'm consistently getting around 2e8 to 4e8 tons/cm³, but the options don't have that. The closest is (c) 1e9. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, or maybe I'm missing a factor. Wait, maybe the question uses grams instead of kilograms? Let me check. Wait, no, the question asks for tons per cm³. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 1 ton is 1000 kg. So 1 kg is 0.001 tons. So 1 kg/m³ is 0.001 tons/m³. Then 1 m³ is 1e6 cm³. So 1 kg/m³ = 0.001 tons / 1e6 cm³ = 1e-9 tons/cm³. So that's correct. So 2.3e17 kg/m³ * 1e-9 = 2.3e8 tons/cm³. So the answer should be approximately 2.3e8, but none of the options match. The options are (a) 0.004, (b) 400, (c) 1e9. So none of these are close to 2.3e8. Unless there's a mistake in the options.\n\nWait, maybe the question is in tons per cubic meter? No, the question says tons per cm³. Alternatively, maybe the question intended to ask for grams per cm³, which would be a different unit. Let's see. If the density is 2.3e17 kg/m³, then converting to grams per cm³: 1 kg = 1000 grams, 1 m³ = 1e6 cm³. So 2.3e17 kg/m³ = 2.3e17 * 1000 g / 1e6 cm³ = 2.3e14 g/cm³. Which is 2.3e14 g/cm³. That's an astronomically large number, but that's expected for nuclear density. But the question is in tons/cm³, so that's different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the options have a typo. For example, if option (c) was 1e8, that would match. But as given, it's 1e9. Alternatively, maybe the original density is 1e18 kg/m³. Let's see what that gives. 1e18 kg/m³ *1e-9 = 1e9 tons/cm³. So that would match option (c). But why would the density be 1e18 kg/m³? That's higher than the standard value. Unless there's a different assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the density of individual nucleons (protons and neutrons) rather than the nucleus as a whole. But nucleons are themselves composed of quarks, and their density would be even higher. But I think the standard nuclear density refers to the nucleus, not individual nucleons.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the mass of the entire nucleus without considering the volume properly. For example, if someone incorrectly calculates the density by taking the mass of a single nucleon and dividing by the volume of a nucleus, but that would be wrong. Let me check.\n\nSuppose we take the mass of a single nucleon (say, a proton) which is about 1.67e-27 kg. The volume of a nucleus with A=1 (which isn't really how it works, but just for calculation) would be (4/3)πr0^3. If r0=1.2e-15 m, then volume is 7.23e-45 m³. Then density would be 1.67e-27 / 7.23e-45 ≈ 2.3e17 kg/m³, which is the same as before. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if someone uses the classical proton radius (about 0.8 fm) instead of the nuclear radius, then the density would be higher. Let's try that. If r0=0.8e-15 m, then volume is (4/3)π*(0.8e-15)^3 ≈ 2.14e-45 m³. Then density would be 1.67e-27 / 2.14e-45 ≈ 7.8e17 kg/m³. Converting to tons/cm³: 7.8e17 *1e-9 = 7.8e8 tons/cm³. Still around 8e8, which is closer to 1e9 but not exactly. Maybe rounding up gives 1e9. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the mass of a neutron star, which is much denser. Neutron star densities are on the order of 1e17 kg/m³ to 1e18 kg/m³. Wait, but that's similar to nuclear density. Wait, no, neutron stars are denser than individual nuclei. Wait, actually, the density of a neutron star is comparable to nuclear density, because neutron stars are essentially giant atomic nuclei. So their density is about 1e17 kg/m³ to 1e18 kg/m³. So if the question is referring to neutron star density, then 1e18 kg/m³ would convert to 1e9 tons/cm³. But the question specifically says \"nuclear matter\", which should be the same as the density in atomic nuclei.\n\nGiven that, I think there's a mistake in the problem options. However, since the closest option to the calculated value of ~2.3e8 tons/cm³ is (c) 1e9, but it's an order of magnitude higher. Alternatively, maybe the question intended to use a different unit. For example, if the answer were in kg/cm³, then 2.3e17 kg/m³ = 2.3e17 kg / 1e6 cm³ = 2.3e11 kg/cm³, which is way larger than any option. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question has a typo and the correct answer is supposed to be 2e8, but it's not listed. In that case, none of the options are correct. But given the options, the closest is (c) 1e9. However, based on standard calculations, the correct answer should be around 2.3e8 tons/cm³, which isn't listed. Therefore, there must be an error in the question or the options. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps the intended answer is (c) 1e9, assuming the density is approximated as 1e18 kg/m³. So I'll go with option (c).\n</think>\n\nThe density of nuclear matter is calculated using the formula for nuclear density, which is derived from the mass of nucleons and the volume of the nucleus. The standard nuclear density is approximately \\(2.3 \\times 10^{17} \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\). Converting this to tons per cubic centimeter involves:\n\n1. **Unit Conversions**:\n   - \\(1 \\, \\text{ton} = 1000 \\, \\text{kg}\\), so divide by \\(1000\\) to convert kg to tons.\n   - \\(1 \\, \\text{m}^3 = 10^6 \\, \\text{cm}^3\\), so divide by \\(10^6\\) to convert cubic meters to cubic centimeters.\n   - Combined conversion factor: \\(1 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 = 10^{-9} \\, \\text{ton/cm}^3\\).\n\n2. **Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   2.3 \\times 10^{17} \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\times 10^{-9} = 2.3 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\text{ton/cm}^3.\n   \\]\n\nThis result (\\(2.3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{ton/cm}^3\\)) does not exactly match any of the provided options. However, option (c) \\(10^9\\) is the closest in magnitude, likely due to an approximation or rounding in the problem setup. Assuming the question intends \\(10^9 \\, \\text{ton/cm}^3\\) as the answer, the correct choice is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["C"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "C", "expr2": "10^9"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "C", "expr2": "1000000000"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-38", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. I need to determine the dominant multipole transitions for each of the given atomic transitions. Remember, the multipole transitions depend on the change in angular momentum and parity. \n\nStarting with the first transition: 2p_{1/2} → 1s_{1/2}. The initial state is a p orbital (l=1) and the final state is an s orbital (l=0). The photon emitted must carry away angular momentum. The change in angular momentum Δl is from l=1 to l=0, so Δl = 1. But wait, in terms of the transition, the photon's angular momentum is given by the multipole order. For electric dipole (E1), the angular momentum change is 1, which matches here. Also, parity change: p to s. The parity of a state is (-1)^l. Initial parity is (-1)^1 = -1, final is (-1)^0 = +1. So parity changes, which is allowed for E1 (since E1 has parity (-1)^{L+1} where L=1, so parity change is -1^(1+1) = +1, but wait, maybe I should think differently. The parity of the multipole transition: electric dipole (E1) has parity (-1)^{L} where L=1, so parity is -1. The transition must have a parity change equal to the parity of the multipole. So initial parity is -1, final is +1. The change is (-1)^{initial} * parity of multipole = (-1)^{1} * (-1)^1 = (-1)^2 = +1, which matches the final parity. So yes, E1 is allowed. So the dominant multipole here is E1.\n\nSecond transition: 2s_{1/2} → 1s_{1/2}. Here, initial state is s (l=0), final is s (l=0). So Δl = 0. But for electric dipole, Δl should be ±1. So E1 is not allowed. Then we need higher multipoles. Since Δl=0, but the photon must carry away angular momentum. Wait, the total angular momentum change is from the initial to final state. The electron's angular momentum is l=0 to l=0, so the photon must carry away angular momentum. But the electron transition's Δl is 0, so how does that work? Maybe the spin is involved? Wait, but in LS coupling, the total angular momentum j is involved. The initial state is 2s_{1/2}, so j=1/2. The final state is 1s_{1/2}, j=1/2. So Δj can be 0 or ±1 (since photon carries away 1 unit). But here, j_initial = 1/2, j_final = 1/2. So possible Δj = 0, ±1. But since j can't be negative, Δj can be 0 or 1. But here, Δj is 0. So the photon must carry away angular momentum 1 (since 0 to 0 with a photon of angular momentum 1? Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of selection rules. For electric dipole (E1), the selection rules are Δl = ±1, Δj = 0, ±1. But here, Δl=0, so E1 is forbidden. So the next possibility is magnetic dipole (M1) or electric quadrupole (E2). M1 has Δl=0, because M1 is a spin-flip or something? Wait, M1 transitions are due to the magnetic dipole moment, which can occur when there's a change in the magnetic dipole moment. For M1, the selection rules are Δl=0 (since it's a spin term?), and Δj=0, ±1. But in this case, since l is the same (both s states), so Δl=0. So M1 is possible. But wait, parity for M1: the parity of the multipole. For M1, the parity is (-1)^{L} where L=1 (since magnetic dipole is L=1), so parity is (-1)^1 = -1. The initial state has parity (-1)^0 = +1, final state also +1. So the parity change is +1 to +1, so the multipole's parity must be +1. But M1 has parity -1, so that would require the parity change to be (-1)^{L+1}? Wait, maybe I need to check the parity change. The parity of the transition is given by the product of initial and final parities. The transition operator for M1 has parity (-1)^{L} where L=1, so parity is -1. The initial state parity is +1, final is +1. So the transition must have parity (-1)^{L} for electric multipoles, and (-1)^{L+1} for magnetic? Wait, I think the parity change for electric multipole transitions is (-1)^L, and for magnetic it's (-1)^{L+1}. So for E1, parity change is (-1)^1 = -1. So initial parity is +1 (s state), final parity would be -1 (p state), but in our first case, the parity changed from -1 to +1, which is a change of +2, but parity is multiplicative. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me recall: the parity of the transition operator for electric 2^L-pole is (-1)^L, and for magnetic it's (-1)^{L+1}. The transition is allowed if the product of the initial parity and the operator's parity equals the final parity. So for E1 (L=1), operator parity is (-1)^1 = -1. So initial parity * (-1) = final parity. For the first transition (2p to 1s): initial parity (-1)^1 = -1, operator parity -1. So -1 * (-1) = +1, which matches the final parity (+1). Correct. Now for the second transition (2s to 1s): initial parity +1, final parity +1. So operator parity must be +1 (since +1 * operator parity = +1). So operator parity +1. Which multipole has that? Electric even L or magnetic. For electric, L must be even. So E2 (L=2) would have parity (-1)^2 = +1. But E2 requires Δl = ±2. But here, Δl=0. So E2 is not possible. For magnetic dipole (M1), L=1, parity (-1)^{1+1} = (-1)^2 = +1. Wait, no: magnetic multipoles have parity (-1)^{L+1}. So for M1 (L=1), parity is (-1)^{1+1} = +1. So operator parity +1. So the transition would require that initial parity * operator parity = final parity. Here, initial and final parities are +1. So +1 * +1 = +1, which matches. So M1 is allowed. But does the selection rule for M1 allow Δl=0? Because M1 transitions are usually associated with spin flips or changes in angular momentum without changing l. For example, transitions between hyperfine levels (like in hydrogen 21 cm line) are M1. So in this case, since l doesn't change (both s states), and the transition is M1. So the dominant multipole here is M1.\n\nThird transition: 3d_{3/2} → 2s_{1/2}. Initial state is d (l=2), final is s (l=0). So Δl = -2. The photon must carry away angular momentum L such that |Δl| ≤ L. Here, Δl = 2, so L must be at least 2. So possible multipoles are E2 (electric quadrupole) or M2 (magnetic quadrupole). Now check parity. Initial parity is (-1)^2 = +1, final parity is (-1)^0 = +1. So parity change is +1 to +1. The operator parity must be +1. For E2 (L=2), parity is (-1)^2 = +1. For M2 (L=2), parity is (-1)^{2+1} = -1. So only E2 is possible here. So dominant multipole is E2.\n\nFourth transition: 2p_{3/2} → 2p_{1/2}. Initial state is p (l=1), final is p (l=1). So Δl=0. The angular momentum change must come from the photon. The initial j is 3/2, final j is 1/2. So Δj = -1. Photon carries away 1 unit of angular momentum. So L=1. Now check parity. Initial parity (-1)^1 = -1, final parity -1. So parity change is -1 to -1. The operator parity must be such that (-1) * operator parity = (-1). So operator parity is +1. For E1 (L=1), parity is (-1)^1 = -1. For M1 (L=1), parity is (-1)^{1+1} = +1. So M1 is allowed. So dominant multipole is M1.\n\nFifth transition: 3d_{3/2} → 2p_{1/2}. Initial state is d (l=2), final is p (l=1). Δl = -1. So L must be at least 1. Possible E1 (L=1) or M1 (L=1). Check parity. Initial parity (+1) (d: l=2), final parity (-1) (p: l=1). So parity change from +1 to -1. The operator must have parity (-1) * (+1) = -1 (since initial parity * operator parity = final parity). For E1 (L=1), parity is (-1)^1 = -1. So that works. So E1 is allowed. So dominant multipole is E1.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\n1. E1\n\n2. M1\n\n3. E2\n\n4. M1\n\n5. E1\n\nNow part (b): Estimate the transition rate for the first transition (E1) in terms of ω, a, and constants. The transition rate for electric dipole is given by the Einstein A coefficient, which is approximately A ≈ (e^2 ω^3 a^2)/(3πε_0 ħ c^3). But let's recall the formula. The standard formula for E1 transition rate is:\n\nA = ( (e^2 ω^3 ) / (3 π ε_0 ħ c^3) ) * |<f| r |i>|^2\n\nAssuming that the matrix element |<f| r |i>| is of the order of the atomic radius a, then |<r>| ~ a. So substituting, A ≈ (e^2 ω^3 a^2)/(3 π ε_0 ħ c^3). \n\nBut let's check the constants. The actual expression is:\n\nA = (4 ω^3 e^2 |<r>|^2)/(3 ħ c^3)\n\nWait, different forms. Let me recall the exact expression. The Einstein A coefficient for electric dipole transitions is:\n\nA = ( (4 α ω^3 )/(3 c^2) ) * |<f| r |i>|^2\n\nWhere α is the fine structure constant. Alternatively, using e^2/(4π ε_0 ħ c) = α. So substituting, maybe:\n\nA ≈ (4/3) (α ω^3 / c^2) a^2\n\nBut to express in terms of given parameters (ω, a, and constants), we can write:\n\nA ~ (e^2 ω^3 a^2)/(ε_0 ħ c^3)\n\nBut let's make sure. The exact formula from the transition rate is:\n\nA = ( (8 π α)/(3) ) (ω^3/c^2) |<r>|^2\n\nBut perhaps the numerical factors vary depending on the approximation. Since the problem says \"estimate\", we can ignore numerical factors and write:\n\nA ≈ (e^2 ω^3 a^2)/(ε_0 ħ c^3)\n\nBut let's check dimensions. e^2/(ε_0) has units of N m^2. ω^3 has units of s^{-3}, a^2 is m^2, ħ has J s, c^3 is m^3/s^3. Let's compute the units:\n\n(e^2/(ε_0)) * ω^3 a^2 / (ħ c^3) = (C^2/(N m^2))^{-1}? Wait, e^2/(ε_0) has units of (C^2)/( (C^2/(N m^2)) ) ) = N m^2. Then multiply by ω^3 (s^{-3}), a^2 (m^2), divided by ħ (J s) and c^3 (m^3/s^3). So:\n\nN m^2 * s^{-3} * m^2 / (J s * m^3/s^3) ) = (N m^4 s^{-3}) / ( (J s) m^3 s^{-3} )) = (N m) / (J s). Since N m = J, so J / (J s) ) = 1/s. Which is correct for transition rate (units of s^{-1}).\n\nSo the expression is dimensionally correct. So the estimate is A ≈ (e^2 ω^3 a^2)/(ε_0 ħ c^3). \n\nFor a numerical estimate, typical atomic transitions have ω ~ 10^15 Hz, a ~ 0.1 nm = 1e-10 m. Let's plug in numbers:\n\ne ≈ 1.6e-19 C\n\nε_0 ≈ 8.85e-12 F/m\n\nħ ≈ 1.05e-34 J s\n\nc ≈ 3e8 m/s\n\nCompute numerator: e^2 ω^3 a^2 ≈ (1.6e-19)^2 * (1e15)^3 * (1e-10)^2\n\n= (2.56e-38 C^2) * (1e45 s^{-3}) * (1e-20 m^2)\n\n= 2.56e-38 * 1e45 * 1e-20 = 2.56e-13 C^2 m^2 s^{-3}\n\nDenominator: ε_0 ħ c^3 ≈ 8.85e-12 * 1.05e-34 * (3e8)^3\n\n= 8.85e-12 * 1.05e-34 * 2.7e24\n\n= 8.85 * 1.05 * 2.7e(-12-34+24) = approx 25e-22 = 2.5e-21\n\nSo A ≈ 2.56e-13 / 2.5e-21 ≈ 1e8 s^{-1}\n\nSo the transition rate is around 1e8 per second. Typical E1 transitions are of order 1e8 s^{-1}, which matches. For example, the 2p → 1s transition in hydrogen has a lifetime of about 1e-8 seconds, so rate ~1e8 s^{-1}.\n\nPart (c): Estimate the ratios of the other transition rates relative to the first one (E1). The transition rate for multipole transitions scales with (a/λ)^{2L}, where λ is the wavelength, and L is the multipole order. Since λ ~ c/ω, so (a ω/c)^{2L}. For electric dipole (E1), L=1; for M1, L=1; for E2, L=2, etc. The transition rate for a multipole of order L is proportional to (a ω/c)^{2L} times the E1 rate. \n\nSo for each transition:\n\n1. First transition (E1): reference rate A1 ~ (a ω/c)^2 * (e^2 ω/(ε_0 ħ c)).\n\nBut in part (b), we have A ≈ (e^2 ω^3 a^2)/(ε_0 ħ c^3) = (e^2/(ε_0 ħ c^3)) ω^3 a^2. Alternatively, writing (a ω/c)^2 * (ω e^2/(ε_0 ħ c)). But perhaps the scaling is better considered as A ∝ ω^{3} a^{2} for E1. For higher multipoles, the rate is suppressed by (a ω/c)^{2(L-1)}. For example, M1 has the same L=1 as E1, but the rate for M1 is smaller by a factor of (α)^2, since magnetic moments are smaller by α. Wait, but in the case of M1 transitions, the transition rate is proportional to (μ_B)^2 instead of (e a)^2, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. μ_B ≈ e ħ/(2 m_e c). So the ratio of M1 to E1 rates would be (μ_B/(e a))^2 ~ (ħ/(2 m_e c a))^2. But since a ≈ ħ^2/(m_e e^2) (Bohr radius), substituting:\n\nħ/(m_e c a) = ħ/(m_e c (ħ^2/(m_e e^2))) ) = (m_e e^2)/(ħ m_e c) ) = e^2/(ħ c) ) = α ≈ 1/137. So the ratio (M1/E1) ~ α^2. So for the second transition (M1), the rate is A2 ≈ A1 * α^2. Similarly, for E2 (L=2), the rate is A3 ≈ A1 * (a ω/c)^2. For the third transition (E2), which is E2, so L=2. So the ratio would be (a ω/c)^2. For typical atomic transitions, a ~ 1e-10 m, ω ~ 1e15 Hz, so c/ω ~ 3e8 /1e15 = 3e-7 m. So a ω/c ≈ (1e-10 * 1e15)/3e8 ≈ (1e5)/3e8 ≈ 3e-4. Then (a ω/c)^2 ≈ 1e-7. So E2 rate is ~1e-7 times E1 rate. \n\nSimilarly, for the fourth transition (M1), the ratio is α^2 ≈ (1/137)^2 ≈ 5e-5. \n\nFor the fifth transition (E1), same as the first, so ratio 1. Wait, no: the fifth transition is E1, so its rate is similar to the first one. But wait, the first transition is 2p→1s, fifth is 3d→2p. The matrix element might differ, but the problem says to estimate the ratios in terms of the same parameters (ω, a, etc.). Assuming that the matrix elements |<r>| are of the same order (a), then the rate would be similar. But actually, the frequency ω might be different. However, the problem says to express the ratios in terms of the same parameters as in (b), which are ω, a, etc. So if the first transition has rate A1 ~ ω^3 a^2, and the fifth transition also E1, then A5/A1 = (ω5^3 a5^2)/(ω1^3 a1^2). But if we are to assume that the parameters ω and a are the same (even though in reality they might differ), the problem might want us to take the ratio as 1. But that seems unlikely. Wait, the problem says \"estimate the ratios of the other transition rates (for the other transitions in (a)) relative to the first one in terms of the same parameters as in (b)\". So parameters are ω, a, etc. So for each transition, we need to express their rates relative to A1 (the first transition's rate), using the same ω and a. But in reality, different transitions have different ω and a, but the problem says to use the same parameters. So perhaps we are to assume that ω and a are the same for all transitions, which is an approximation. For example, for the second transition (M1), the rate is A2 ≈ A1 * (α^2). For the third (E2), A3 ≈ A1 * (a ω/c)^2. Fourth (M1), same as second: A4 ≈ A1 * α^2. Fifth (E1), same as first: A5 ≈ A1. But wait, the fifth transition is E1, so if all parameters are same, then ratio is 1. But in reality, the fifth transition's ω would be different. But according to the problem statement, we are to express in terms of the same parameters. So the answer would be:\n\nTransition 2 (M1): ratio ~ α² ≈ (1/137)² ≈ 5e-5\n\nTransition 3 (E2): ratio ~ (aω/c)² ≈ ( (a/c) ω )². For typical a=1e-10 m, ω=1e15 rad/s, aω/c ≈ (1e-10 *1e15)/3e8 ≈ 3e-4, squared is ~1e-7\n\nTransition 4 (M1): same as transition 2, ratio ~ α² ≈5e-5\n\nTransition 5 (E1): same as transition 1, ratio ~1\n\nBut wait, transition 5 is E1, so if the parameters ω and a are the same as in transition 1, then the rate is the same. But in reality, transition 5 might have different ω and a, but the problem says to use the same parameters. So the ratios would be:\n\n- Transition 2: α²\n\n- Transition 3: (aω/c)^2\n\n- Transition 4: α²\n\n- Transition 5: 1\n\nBut need to confirm. For example, transition 3 is E2, so its rate scales as (aω/c)^2 compared to E1. So the ratio A3/A1 ~ (aω/c)^2. Similarly, M1 transitions have A2/A1 ~ (α)^2. Transition 5 is E1, so same as A1, ratio 1. Transition 4 is M1, same as transition 2, ratio α². \n\nSo the ratios are:\n\n2. A2/A1 ≈ α²\n\n3. A3/A1 ≈ (aω/c)^2\n\n4. A4/A1 ≈ α²\n\n5. A5/A1 ≈1\n\nBut wait, transition 5 is E1, but if the matrix element is different? The problem says to estimate in terms of the same parameters. If the matrix elements |<r>| are considered similar (order a), then yes, ratio 1. But if the matrix element for 3d→2p is different, but the problem says to use the same parameters, so we can ignore that and take ratio 1. \n\nSo the final answer for part (c) would be these ratios.\n</think>\n\n(a) The dominant multipoles for each transition are determined by angular momentum and parity selection rules:\n\n1. **\\(2p_{1/2} \\rightarrow 1s_{1/2}\\)**: Electric dipole

{"id": "atomic/2-45", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to discuss thermonuclear reactions and give examples from the Sun, hydrogen bombs, and controlled fusion attempts. Also, estimate the energy per reaction in electron volts and identify the key characteristic of nuclear forces involved. Let me start by recalling what thermonuclear reactions are. They're nuclear reactions that occur at high temperatures where atomic nuclei collide and fuse, releasing energy. The main process in the Sun is fusion of hydrogen into helium. \n\nFirst, the Sun's reactions. The primary one is the proton-proton chain. Let me remember the steps. The first step is two protons fusing to form deuterium, a positron, and a neutrino. Then the deuterium fuses with another proton to make helium-3, and then two helium-3 nuclei combine to form helium-4 and two protons. Alternatively, there's the CNO cycle, but maybe the proton-proton is more dominant in the Sun. \n\nFor the energy per reaction, each fusion of four protons into helium-4 releases about 26.7 MeV. But per reaction step, like in each individual fusion step, the energy release varies. For example, the first step (proton-proton) releases about 0.42 MeV, but considering the entire chain to form helium, it's around 26.7 MeV total. Wait, but the question says \"per reaction,\" so maybe per individual reaction step. Hmm.\n\nThen the H-bomb uses fusion reactions, typically combining isotopes of hydrogen like deuterium (²H) and tritium (³H). The classic DT reaction is deuterium plus tritium fusing into helium-4 and a neutron. The energy released here is about 17.6 MeV per reaction. That's a key example. \n\nControlled fusion attempts, like in tokamaks or inertial confinement, also aim for DT reactions because they have the highest cross-section at achievable temperatures. So same as H-bomb, but in a controlled manner. Other reactions might include deuterium-deuterium reactions, which can branch into either producing helium-3 and a neutron or tritium and a proton. Each branch releases around 3.3 MeV or 4.0 MeV, but the DT is more energetic per reaction.\n\nNow, estimating energy per reaction. For the Sun's proton-proton chain, the total energy per helium-4 is ~26.7 MeV. But each individual reaction step has lower energy. For example, the first proton-proton reaction releases about 0.42 MeV (but that's including the positron annihilation?), and subsequent steps add up. But maybe the question wants the average per reaction. Alternatively, per fusion event. For the H-bomb and controlled fusion, the DT reaction is 17.6 MeV per fusion. \n\nThe nuclear force characteristic involved is the strong nuclear force, which is short-range (acts over femtometer distances) and is responsible for binding protons and neutrons together. The key here is that at very close distances, the strong force overcomes the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged nuclei, allowing fusion to occur. So the short-range nature of the nuclear force is crucial because it allows nuclei to get close enough (when they have enough thermal energy) for the strong force to take over and bind them.\n\nPutting it all together: examples are proton-proton chain in the Sun, DT in H-bomb and controlled fusion. Energy per reaction: Sun's overall process ~26 MeV per He-4, DT ~17.6 MeV per reaction. The key nuclear force characteristic is the strong force's short range enabling fusion once Coulomb barrier is overcome.\n</think>\n\nThermonuclear reactions are nuclear fusion processes that occur at extremely high temperatures, enabling atomic nuclei to overcome electrostatic repulsion and fuse, releasing energy. These reactions are driven by the strong nuclear force, which acts at short ranges (∼1 femtometer) to bind nucleons once they are in close proximity.\n\n**Examples and Energy Release:**\n\n1. **The Sun (Proton-Proton Chain):**  \n   - Primary reaction sequence:  \n     \\( ^1\\text{H} + ^1\\text{H} \\rightarrow ^2\\text{H} + e^+ + \\nu_e \\) (0.42 MeV),  \n     \\( ^2\\text{H} + ^1\\text{H} \\rightarrow ^3\\text{He} + \\gamma \\) (5.49 MeV),  \n     \\( ^3\\text{He} + ^3\\text{He} \\rightarrow ^4\\text{He} + 2\\,^1\\text{H} \\) (12.86 MeV).  \n   - Total energy per helium-4 produced: **≈26.7 MeV**.\n\n2. **Hydrogen Bomb (Deuterium-Tritium Fusion):**  \n   - Dominant reaction:  \n     \\( ^2\\text{H} + ^3\\text{H} \\rightarrow ^4\\text{He} + n \\).  \n   - Energy release: **≈17.6 MeV per reaction**.\n\n3. **Controlled Fusion (e.g., Tokamaks):**  \n   - Focus on deuterium-tritium (DT) reaction (same as H-bomb) due to high cross-section.  \n   - Alternative deuterium-deuterium (DD) reactions:  \n     \\( ^2\\text{H} + ^2\\text{H} \\rightarrow ^3\\text{He} + n \\) (3.27 MeV),  \n     \\( ^2\\text{H} + ^2\\text{H} \\rightarrow ^3\\text{H} + ^1\\text{H} \\) (4.03 MeV).  \n\n**Key Nuclear Force Characteristic:**  \nThe **short-range strong nuclear force** enables fusion by overpowering the Coulomb repulsion between nuclei at distances <1 fm.

{"id": "atomic/4-4", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these physics problems one by one. Starting with part (a). \n\nSo, the question is about a muon that needs to reach the Earth's surface. The muon is produced high in the atmosphere, around 10^4 meters up. The muon's rest lifetime is 10^-6 seconds, and its mass is 100 MeV/c². We need to find how energetic it must be to reach the surface. \n\nHmm, muons are elementary particles similar to electrons but much heavier. They're unstable, so they decay quickly. But because they're moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime from our perspective (lab frame) is longer due to time dilation. That must be the key here. The idea is that even though the muon's proper lifetime is short, from our frame on Earth, its lifetime is extended enough so it can travel the distance from the upper atmosphere to the ground.\n\nFirst, let's recall the time dilation formula. The lifetime in the lab frame (Earth's frame) is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest.\n\nThe distance the muon needs to travel is 10^4 meters. The speed of the muon is v, so the time it takes to reach the Earth is distance divided by speed: t = d / v. But this time must be less than or equal to the lab frame lifetime of the muon. Otherwise, it would decay before reaching the surface.\n\nWait, but actually, the time it takes for the muon to reach Earth must be less than or equal to the lab frame lifetime. So, t = d / v <= gamma * tau_rest.\n\nBut since the muon is moving at relativistic speeds, v is close to c. Maybe we can approximate v ≈ c? Let me check. If the muon is highly energetic, then yes, v ≈ c. But maybe we need to be precise here. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, the distance the muon can travel before decaying is v * gamma * tau_rest. So, the required distance is v * gamma * tau_rest >= 10^4 m.\n\nIf we take v ≈ c, then gamma ≈ (c * tau_rest) / d. Wait, no. Let's write the equation properly.\n\nThe distance the muon travels before decaying is v * gamma * tau_rest. So:\n\nv * gamma * tau_rest >= d.\n\nBut if we take v ≈ c (since it's relativistic), then:\n\nc * gamma * tau_rest >= d.\n\nSo, gamma >= d / (c * tau_rest).\n\nLet me compute that. The distance d is 1e4 meters. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. Tau_rest is 1e-6 seconds.\n\nSo, gamma >= (1e4 m) / (3e8 m/s * 1e-6 s) = 1e4 / (3e8 * 1e-6) = 1e4 / (3e2) = (1e4)/(3e2) = 100 / 3 ≈ 33.333...\n\nSo gamma needs to be at least about 33.33. Therefore, the muon's energy must be gamma times its rest mass energy. The rest mass is 100 MeV/c², so energy E = gamma * m c² = gamma * 100 MeV.\n\nSo, E ≈ 33.33 * 100 MeV ≈ 3333 MeV, which is 3.333 GeV. But maybe we need to be precise with the calculation. Let's compute the exact value.\n\ngamma = 1e4 / (3e8 * 1e-6) = 1e4 / (3e2) = (1e4)/(3e2) = (1e4)/(3e2) = (1e2)/3 ≈ 33.333...\n\nSo, gamma ≈ 33.33. Therefore, energy E = gamma * m c² = 33.33 * 100 MeV ≈ 3333 MeV or 3.33 GeV. So, the muon needs to have an energy of approximately 3.33 GeV. But maybe the problem expects an exact answer. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nWait, let's compute the denominator: c * tau_rest = 3e8 m/s * 1e-6 s = 3e2 meters. So, the muon, even at rest, would only travel 3e2 meters in its lifetime. But we need it to travel 1e4 meters, so the gamma factor must compensate. So, gamma = d / (c * tau_rest) = 1e4 / 3e2 = 100/3 ≈ 33.333. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the energy is gamma * 100 MeV = 100 * 100/3 MeV = 10000/3 ≈ 3333.33 MeV, which is 3.333 GeV. So, the answer is approximately 3.33 GeV, but maybe we can write it as (10^4 / (3 * 10^2)) * 100 MeV = (10^4 / 300) * 100 = (100/3) * 100 = 10^4 /3 ≈ 3333.33 MeV. So, 3.333 x 10^3 MeV, which is 3.33 GeV. So, the answer is approximately 3.3 GeV. But maybe the problem wants the answer in terms of exact fraction. Let me check. 1e4 / (3e8 * 1e-6) = 1e4 / (3e2) = 100/3. So, gamma is exactly 100/3. Therefore, energy is (100/3) * 100 MeV = 10^4 /3 MeV ≈ 3333.33 MeV. So, 3333.33 MeV or 3.333 GeV. So, the answer is approximately 3.3 GeV. But maybe the problem expects an exact answer. Let me check if there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the relation between lifetime, speed, and distance. The proper lifetime is tau = 1e-6 s. The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. The distance is v gamma tau. So, v gamma tau = d. If we take v ≈ c, then gamma ≈ d / (c tau). So, same as before. So, the answer is gamma = d/(c tau) = 1e4/(3e8 *1e-6) = 1e4/(3e2) = 100/3. So, energy is gamma * m c² = (100/3)*100 = 10^4/3 MeV ≈ 3333.33 MeV. So, the answer is 10^4/3 MeV, which can be written as (10000/3) MeV. So, boxed as \\boxed{\\dfrac{10000}{3} \\text{ MeV}} or approximately 3.33 GeV. But maybe the problem wants the answer in GeV. Let me check the units. The mass is given in MeV/c², so energy is in MeV. So, 10000/3 MeV is correct. So, boxed as \\boxed{\\dfrac{10^4}{3} \\text{ MeV}}.\n\nMoving on to part (b). The Earth has a 1-gauss magnetic field pointing along its axis, extending out to 1e4 meters. We need to find how much and in what direction a muon of energy E is deflected when it's normally incident at the equator. \n\nFirst, the magnetic field direction is along the Earth's axis. At the equator, the magnetic field lines are horizontal, pointing north. Wait, no. Wait, the Earth's magnetic field is approximately a dipole. At the equator, the magnetic field is horizontal (parallel to the Earth's surface) and points northward. But the problem says the field is pointing in the direction of the axis, so if we approximate it as a uniform field aligned with the axis, then at the equator, the magnetic field would be pointing north, parallel to the ground. Wait, no. If the Earth's magnetic field is like a bar magnet, then at the equator, the field lines are parallel to the ground, pointing north. So, the B field is horizontal, pointing north. \n\nA muon is incident normally at the equator. Normally incident would mean moving radially towards the Earth's center, so its velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field. Because the velocity is perpendicular to B, the Lorentz force will cause circular motion in the plane perpendicular to B. The deflection would be the radius of curvature, but since the muon is moving through the field for a certain distance (the extent of the field is 1e4 meters), we need to calculate the deflection angle or the displacement. \n\nWait, the problem states the magnetic field extends out to 1e4 m. So, the muon is moving through a region of 1e4 meters with a magnetic field of 1 Gauss. The muon's path will be curved due to the Lorentz force. The deflection can be found by calculating the radius of curvature and then the angle or the lateral displacement. \n\nThe force on the muon is F = q(v × B). Since velocity is perpendicular to B, the force magnitude is qvB. This provides the centripetal force: mv²/r = qvB => r = mv/(qB). But since the muon is relativistic, we need to use relativistic momentum. So, the radius is gamma m v / (q B). But since v ≈ c for high-energy muons, we can write r ≈ gamma m c / (q B). \n\nBut the muon is moving through a region of length L = 1e4 m. The actual path is an arc of a circle with radius r, and the length of the arc is L. The angle theta is L / r (in radians). Then, the deflection (the chord length) is approximately r (1 - cos(theta)), but for small angles, theta ≈ L / r, and the deflection delta ≈ (L^2)/(2r). \n\nAlternatively, if the angle is small, the deflection can be approximated by delta = (q B L^2)/(2 gamma m c). Let's check the formula. \n\nThe radius of curvature r = gamma m v / (q B). Since v ≈ c, r ≈ gamma m c / (q B). The deflection angle theta = L / r = (q B L) / (gamma m c). The lateral displacement delta ≈ (1/2) r theta^2 = (1/2) (gamma m c / (q B)) ( (q B L)/(gamma m c) )^2 ) = (1/2) (q B L^2)/(gamma m c). So, delta = (q B L^2)/(2 gamma m c). \n\nBut let's make sure. If the muon enters the magnetic field region and moves along a circular arc for a distance L, the deflection is the amount it's pushed sideways. For small angles, delta ≈ (q B L^2)/(2 gamma m c). \n\nGiven that, we can plug in the numbers. \n\nFirst, convert the magnetic field from Gauss to Tesla. 1 Tesla = 10^4 Gauss, so 1 Gauss = 1e-4 T. So, B = 1e-4 T. \n\nThe charge of the muon is the same as the electron's: q = -e = -1.6e-19 C. But since we're interested in the magnitude, we can ignore the sign. The direction will depend on the charge, which is negative. \n\nThe length L is 1e4 meters. \n\nThe mass m is 100 MeV/c². Let's convert that to kg. 1 MeV/c² is approximately 1.7827e-30 kg. So, 100 MeV/c² = 100 * 1.7827e-30 kg = 1.7827e-28 kg. \n\nGamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E / (m c²). Since the muon's energy is E, gamma = E / (100 MeV). \n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\ndelta = (|q| B L^2) / (2 gamma m c)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n|q| = e = 1.6e-19 C\n\nB = 1e-4 T\n\nL = 1e4 m\n\ngamma = E / (100 MeV) [E is in MeV]\n\nm = 1.7827e-28 kg\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nSo,\n\ndelta = (1.6e-19 C * 1e-4 T * (1e4)^2 ) / (2 * (E / 100 MeV) * 1.7827e-28 kg * 3e8 m/s)\n\nFirst, compute the numerator:\n\n1.6e-19 * 1e-4 = 1.6e-23\n\n(1e4)^2 = 1e8\n\nSo numerator: 1.6e-23 * 1e8 = 1.6e-15 C*T*m²\n\nDenominator:\n\n2 * (E / 100 MeV) * 1.7827e-28 kg * 3e8 m/s\n\nFirst, note that 1 MeV = 1.60218e-13 J, so 100 MeV = 1.60218e-11 J. But since gamma is E/(100 MeV), then gamma is unitless. So, E in MeV divided by 100 MeV gives gamma. So, (E / 100 MeV) is unitless. \n\nSo, denominator:\n\n2 * (E / 100) * 1.7827e-28 kg * 3e8 m/s\n\nCompute the constants:\n\n2 * 1.7827e-28 * 3e8 = 2 * 1.7827e-28 * 3e8 = 2 * 5.3481e-20 = 1.0696e-19 kg*m/s\n\nSo denominator: 1.0696e-19 * (E / 100) kg*m/s\n\nTherefore, delta = (1.6e-15) / (1.0696e-19 * (E / 100)) ) meters\n\nSimplify:\n\n1.6e-15 / 1.0696e-19 = 1.6 / 1.0696 * 1e4 ≈ 1.5 * 1e4 = 1.5e4 (exact value: 1.6 / 1.0696 ≈ 1.6 / 1.0696 ≈ 1.496 approx 1.5)\n\nSo, delta ≈ 1.5e4 / (E / 100) = 1.5e4 * 100 / E = 1.5e6 / E (if E is in MeV)\n\nTherefore, delta ≈ 1.5e6 / E meters, where E is in MeV.\n\nBut wait, let's check the units. The numerator in delta is C*T*m². Let's recall that 1 T = kg/(C*s), so C*T = kg/s. Therefore, C*T*m² = kg*m²/s. The denominator is kg*m/s. So, (kg*m²/s) / (kg*m/s) ) = m. So units check out.\n\nSo, delta ≈ (1.5e6 / E) meters. But E is in MeV, so if E is, say, 1 GeV (1000 MeV), delta would be 1.5e6 / 1e3 = 1.5e3 meters. That seems very large. Wait, but maybe I made a miscalculation. Let's recheck the numbers.\n\nWait, let's redo the calculation step by step.\n\nNumerator:\n\nq*B*L² = (1.6e-19 C)(1e-4 T)(1e4 m)^2\n\nFirst, compute (1e4 m)^2 = 1e8 m²\n\nMultiply by 1e-4 T: 1e8 * 1e-4 = 1e4 T*m²\n\nMultiply by 1.6e-19 C: 1.6e-19 * 1e4 = 1.6e-15 C*T*m²\n\nDenominator:\n\n2 gamma m c = 2*(E/(100 MeV))*(1.7827e-28 kg)*(3e8 m/s)\n\nFirst, compute 2*1.7827e-28*3e8 = 2*1.7827e-28*3e8 = 2*5.3481e-20 = 1.0696e-19 kg*m/s\n\nMultiply by gamma = E/(100 MeV). But note that E in MeV is energy, and 100 MeV is the rest energy. So, gamma = E/(100 MeV). So, the denominator is 1.0696e-19 * (E / 100) kg*m/s\n\nTherefore, delta = (1.6e-15) / (1.0696e-19 * (E/100)) ) meters\n\nCompute 1.6e-15 / 1.0696e-19 = 1.6 / 1.0696 * 1e4 ≈ 1.496 * 1e4 ≈ 1.496e4\n\nThen multiply by 100 / E (since denominator has E/100):\n\ndelta ≈ 1.496e4 * 100 / E ≈ 1.496e6 / E meters\n\nSo, delta ≈ 1.5e6 / E meters. So, if E is in MeV, then delta is 1.5e6 / E meters. For example, if E is 1e4 MeV (10 GeV), delta is 1.5e6 / 1e4 = 150 meters. That seems large, but considering the magnetic field is over 1e4 meters, maybe it's possible. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"how much... is a muon of energy E... deflected\". So, the answer is delta ≈ 1.5e6 / E meters. But we need to express it in terms of E. However, the problem might want the answer in terms of symbols, but since it's part (b), maybe they want a numerical factor. Wait, the question says \"how much, and in what direction, is a muon of energy E normally incident at the equator deflected by the field?\" So, the answer should be expressed as a function of E. \n\nBut let's check the calculation again. Maybe there's a mistake in unit conversions. Let's verify the constants:\n\nCharge of muon: e = 1.6e-19 C\n\nB = 1 Gauss = 1e-4 T\n\nL = 1e4 m\n\ngamma = E/(100 MeV) (since m c² = 100 MeV)\n\nm = 100 MeV/c² = 100 * 1.7827e-30 kg = 1.7827e-28 kg\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nSo, delta = (e B L²)/(2 gamma m c)\n\nPlugging in numbers:\n\ne B L² = (1.6e-19 C)(1e-4 T)(1e4 m)^2 = 1.6e-19 * 1e-4 * 1e8 = 1.6e-19 * 1e4 = 1.6e-15\n\nDenominator: 2 gamma m c = 2*(E/(100 MeV))*(1.7827e-28 kg)*(3e8 m/s)\n\nFirst, compute m c = 1.7827e-28 kg * 3e8 m/s = 5.3481e-20 kg*m/s\n\nThen, denominator = 2 * (E / (100 MeV)) * 5.3481e-20 = (1.0696e-19) * (E / 100 MeV)\n\nBut note that 100 MeV = 1.602e-11 J, but since we're dealing with gamma as a unitless factor (E in MeV divided by 100 MeV), the denominator is 1.0696e-19 * (E / 100) kg*m/s\n\nSo, delta = (1.6e-15) / (1.0696e-19 * (E / 100)) ) = (1.6e-15 * 100) / (1.0696e-19 * E) ) = (1.6e-13) / (1.0696e-19 * E) ) = (1.6 / 1.0696) * 1e6 / E ≈ 1.496 * 1e6 / E ≈ 1.5e6 / E meters\n\nSo, delta ≈ 1.5 x 10^6 / E (meters), where E is in MeV. So, the deflection is inversely proportional to the energy. \n\nAs for the direction, since the muon is negatively charged, the Lorentz force is v × B. If the muon is moving downward (toward the Earth's center) and the magnetic field is pointing north (along the Earth's axis), then using the right-hand rule: velocity downward (south to north axis?), wait, at the equator, if the magnetic field is along the Earth's axis (north), then the velocity is radial (toward the center). So, velocity vector is downward (toward Earth's center), and B is northward. \n\nThe cross product v × B: if velocity is downward (negative z-direction) and B is northward (positive y-direction), then v × B is ( -z × y ) = - ( z × y ) = - ( -x ) = x. So, the force is in the positive x-direction. But since the muon is negatively charged, the force is opposite: - (v × B ) = -x. So, the deflection is to the west. Wait, let's think carefully. \n\nRight-hand rule for positive charge: thumb along velocity (down), fingers along B (north), palm faces direction of force. For a positive charge, force would be east. But since the muon is negative, force is west. Therefore, the muon is deflected to the west. \n\nSo, the direction is westward. \n\nTherefore, the deflection is approximately 1.5e6 / E meters westward, where E is in MeV. \n\nBut the problem might want the answer expressed in terms of symbols. Let me check. The question says \"how much, and in what direction, is a muon of energy E normally incident at the equator deflected by the field?\" So, they want an expression in terms of E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can write it in terms of the muon's momentum. But since the problem states to express it in terms of energy E, we can leave it as delta = (1.5e6 / E) meters westward, with E in MeV. \n\nBut perhaps we should express it more precisely. Let's re-express the formula symbolically. \n\nThe deflection delta is (e B L²)/(2 gamma m c). But gamma = E / (m c²), so delta = (e B L² m c²)/(2 E m c) ) = (e B L² c)/(2 E). \n\nSimplifying, delta = (e B L² c)/(2 E). \n\nPlugging in the constants:\n\ne = 1.6e-19 C\n\nB = 1e-4 T\n\nL = 1e4 m\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nSo,\n\ndelta = (1.6e-19 * 1e-4 * (1e4)^2 * 3e8 ) / (2 * E )\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n1.6e-19 * 1e-4 = 1.6e-23\n\n(1e4)^2 = 1e8\n\n1.6e-23 * 1e8 = 1.6e-15\n\n1.6e-15 * 3e8 = 4.8e-7\n\nDenominator: 2 * E\n\nSo, delta = 4.8e-7 / (2 E ) = 2.4e-7 / E meters. Wait, this contradicts the previous result. Wait, what's happening here. \n\nWait, this approach is different. Let's check the units again. \n\nWait, delta = (e B L² c)/(2 E). \n\nBut E is in MeV. We need to convert E to joules to have consistent SI units. \n\nWait, no. If we keep E in MeV, we need to convert it to joules. Let's see. \n\nBut let's proceed carefully. \n\ndelta = (e B L² c)/(2 E)\n\nBut E is the energy in joules. So, if E is given in MeV, we need to convert it to joules. \n\n1 MeV = 1.60218e-13 J. So, E (J) = E (MeV) * 1.60218e-13 J/MeV.\n\nTherefore, delta = (1.6e-19 C * 1e-4 T * (1e4 m)^2 * 3e8 m/s ) / (2 * E (J) )\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n1.6e-19 * 1e-4 = 1.6e-23\n\n(1e4)^2 = 1e8\n\n1.6e-23 * 1e8 = 1.6e-15\n\n1.6e-15 * 3e8 = 4.8e-7\n\nDenominator: 2 * E (J) = 2 * E (MeV) * 1.60218e-13\n\nSo, delta = 4.8e-7 / (2 * 1.60218e-13 * E (MeV)) )\n\nCompute denominator:\n\n2 * 1.60218e-13 = 3.20436e-13\n\nSo, delta = 4.8e-7 / (3.20436e-13 * E ) = (4.8e-7 / 3.20436e-13 ) / E ≈ (1.5e6 ) / E\n\nWhich matches our previous result. So, delta ≈ 1.5e6 / E meters, where E is in MeV. \n\nTherefore, the deflection is approximately 1.5 x 10^6 / E meters westward. \n\nSo, the answer is that the muon is deflected westward by approximately (1.5 × 10^6 / E) meters. \n\nBut to present it more precisely, using the exact calculation:\n\ndelta = (e B L² c)/(2 E (J)) \n\nBut E (J) = E (MeV) * 1.60218e-13 J/MeV\n\nSo,\n\ndelta = (e B L² c) / (2 * E (MeV) * 1.60218e-13 )\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\ne = 1.6e-19 C\n\nB = 1e-4 T\n\nL = 1e4 m\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nSo,\n\ndelta = (1.6e-19 * 1e-4 * (1e4)^2 * 3e8 ) / (2 * E * 1.60218e-13 )\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n1.6e-19 * 1e-4 = 1.6e-23\n\n(1e4)^2 = 1e8\n\n1.6e-23 * 1e8 = 1.6e-15\n\n1.6e-15 * 3e8 = 4.8e-7\n\nDenominator:\n\n2 * 1.60218e-13 * E = 3.20436e-13 * E\n\nSo,\n\ndelta = 4.8e-7 / (3.20436e-13 * E ) ≈ (4.8 / 3.20436) * 1e6 / E ≈ 1.498 * 1e6 / E ≈ 1.5e6 / E\n\nSo, delta ≈ 1.5e6 / E meters. \n\nTherefore, the deflection is approximately 1.5 million divided by the energy in MeV, in meters, westward. \n\nSo, the answer for part (b) is that the muon is deflected westward by approximately \\boxed{\\dfrac{1.5 \\times 10^6}{E} \\text{ meters}} where E is in MeV. \n\nNow, part (c): Very high-energy protons in cosmic rays can lose energy through collision with 3-K radiation (cosmological background) in the process p + γ → p + π. How energetic need a proton be to be above threshold for this reaction?\n\nThreshold energy is the minimum energy needed for a reaction to occur. For the reaction p + γ → p + π, the threshold occurs when the total energy in the center-of-momentum (CM) frame is equal to the rest mass of the products. \n\nThe rest masses involved are: proton (m_p), pion (m_π), and the photon (which is massless). The initial particles are a proton and a photon. The final state is a proton and a pion. \n\nThe threshold condition is that the total invariant mass squared s must be equal to (m_p + m_π)^2 c^4. \n\nIn the lab frame, where the proton is moving and the photon is from the CMB (which has low energy compared to the proton's energy), we can approximate the photon's energy as much smaller than the proton's energy. But for threshold, we need to consider the photon's energy in the proton's rest frame. Wait, no. The threshold condition is when the proton and photon have just enough energy to produce the proton and pion. \n\nThe standard approach for threshold calculations is to consider the lab frame where the target (photon) is at rest, but photons can't be at rest. Alternatively, since the CMB photon's energy is much smaller than the proton's energy, we can use the head-on collision approximation. \n\nThe threshold condition occurs when the photon's energy in the proton's rest frame is sufficient to create the pion. \n\nAlternatively, using the invariant s = (E_p + E_γ)^2 - (p_p c + p_γ c)^2 = (m_p c^2 + m_π c^2)^2\n\nBut since the photon is massless, E_γ = p_γ c. \n\nAssuming the proton is moving along the same direction as the photon (head-on collision), so the photon's momentum is opposite to the proton's. So, the total energy is E_p + E_γ, and the total momentum is p_p - p_γ (since directions are opposite). \n\nBut for threshold, we need the final particles to be at rest in the CM frame, which implies that in the lab frame, the final particles have the same velocity. However, this is complicated. \n\nAlternatively, using the invariant s:\n\ns = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2 = (m_p c^2 + m_π c^2)^2\n\nBut E_total = E_p + E_γ\n\np_total c = p_p c - p_γ c (since photon is moving opposite to proton)\n\nBut since E_γ = p_γ c, we can write p_γ c = E_γ\n\nSo,\n\ns = (E_p + E_γ)^2 - (p_p c - E_γ)^2 = (m_p c^2 + m_π c^2)^2\n\nExpand the left side:\n\n(E_p + E_γ)^2 - (p_p c - E_γ)^2 = [E_p^2 + 2 E_p E_γ + E_γ^2] - [p_p^2 c^2 - 2 p_p c E_γ + E_γ^2]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= E_p^2 + 2 E_p E_γ + E_γ^2 - p_p^2 c^2 + 2 p_p c E_γ - E_γ^2\n\n= E_p^2 - p_p^2 c^2 + 2 E_p E_γ + 2 p_p c E_γ\n\nBut for the proton, E_p^2 = (p_p c)^2 + (m_p c^2)^2, so E_p^2 - p_p^2 c^2 = (m_p c^2)^2\n\nTherefore, the left side becomes:\n\n(m_p c^2)^2 + 2 E_p E_γ + 2 p_p c E_γ\n\nSet equal to (m_p c^2 + m_π c^2)^2:\n\n(m_p c^2)^2 + 2 E_p E_γ + 2 p_p c E_γ = (m_p c^2 + m_π c^2)^2\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n= (m_p c^2)^2 + 2 m_p c^2 m_π c^2 + (m_π c^2)^2\n\nSubtract (m_p c^2)^2 from both sides:\n\n2 E_p E_γ + 2 p_p c E_γ = 2 m_p c^2 m_π c^2 + (m_π c^2)^2\n\nDivide both sides by 2 E_γ:\n\nE_p + p_p c = (2 m_p m_π c^4 + m_π^2 c^4 ) / (2 E_γ )\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's consider that for high-energy protons, E_p ≈ p_p c (since they're relativistic). So, E_p ≈ p_p c. Then, E_p + p_p c ≈ 2 E_p. \n\nSo, approximately:\n\n2 E_p ≈ (2 m_p m_π c^4 + m_π^2 c^4 ) / (2 E_γ )\n\nBut the photon energy E_γ is from the CMB, which has a temperature of 3 K. The typical photon energy in the CMB is k_B T, where k_B is Boltzmann's constant. \n\nk_B = 8.617e-5 eV/K\n\nSo, for T = 3 K, E_γ ≈ k_B * T = 8.617e-5 eV/K * 3 K ≈ 2.585e-4 eV. \n\nBut this is the average photon energy. However, the threshold calculation requires considering the photon energy in the proton's rest frame. Wait, no. The threshold condition is in the lab frame where the proton is moving and the photon is at low energy. \n\nAlternatively, using the head-on collision approximation where the photon's energy in the proton's rest frame is boosted. \n\nThe threshold condition occurs when the photon's energy in the proton's rest frame is sufficient to create the pion. \n\nThe energy of the photon in the proton's rest frame is given by the Doppler shift formula. For a head-on collision, the photon's energy in the proton's frame is E'_γ = gamma (1 + beta) E_γ, where gamma is the Lorentz factor of the proton, beta = v/c. \n\nThe threshold condition is that E'_γ >= m_π c^2 / 2 (since the pion is produced at rest in the center-of-mass frame, but this might not be accurate). Wait, actually, the correct threshold condition for the reaction p + γ → p + π is that the photon's energy in the proton's rest frame must be at least equal to the pion's rest mass energy. But I need to check. \n\nAlternatively, the minimum photon energy in the proton's rest frame is E'_γ >= m_π c^2 (1 + m_π/(2 m_p)) ). But I might need to derive it. \n\nAlternatively, the threshold condition can be found by considering the conservation of energy and momentum in the lab frame where the proton is moving and the photon is from the CMB. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's recall that the standard threshold energy for pion production in proton-photon collisions is given by the formula:\n\nE_p >= (m_π c^2 (m_p c^2 + m_π c^2 / 2)) / (2 E_γ )\n\nBut I might need to derive it properly. \n\nLet me consider the reaction p + γ → p + π⁰ (assuming neutral pion for simplicity). \n\nThe invariant s is given by s = (E_p + E_γ)^2 - (p_p c - p_γ c)^2 = (m_p c^2 + m_π c^2)^2\n\nAssuming the photon is moving in the opposite direction to the proton (head-on collision), so p_γ is in the opposite direction. \n\nExpanding s:\n\n(E_p + E_γ)^2 - (p_p c - E_γ)^2 = (m_p c^2 + m_π c^2)^2\n\nExpand the left side:\n\nE_p² + 2 E_p E_γ + E_γ² - (p_p² c² - 2 p_p c E_γ + E_γ²)\n\n= E_p² + 2 E_p E_γ + E_γ² - p_p² c² + 2 p_p c E_γ - E_γ²\n\n= E_p² - p_p² c² + 2 E_p E_γ + 2 p_p c E_γ\n\nBut E_p² = p_p² c² + m_p² c^4, so substituting:\n\n= m_p² c^4 + 2 E_p E_γ + 2 p_p c E_γ\n\nSet equal to (m_p c² + m_π c²)^2 = m_p² c^4 + 2 m_p m_π c^4 + m_π² c^4\n\nTherefore:\n\nm_p² c^4", "final_answers": ["\\dfrac{10000}{3} \\text{ MeV}", "\\dfrac{10^4}{3} \\text{ MeV}", "\\dfrac{1.5 \\times 10^6}{E} \\text{ meters}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\dfrac{10000}{3} \\text{ MeV}", "expr2": "3.3 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\dfrac{10000}{3} \\text{ MeV}", "expr2": "\\frac{1.5 \\times 10^3}{E} \\, \\text{m}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\dfrac{10000}{3} \\text{ MeV}", "expr2": "1.82 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\dfrac{10^4}{3} \\text{ MeV}", "expr2": "3.3 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\dfrac{10^4}{3} \\text{ MeV}", "expr2": "\\frac{1.5 \\times 10^3}{E} \\, \\text{m}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\dfrac{10^4}{3} \\text{ MeV}", "expr2": "1.82 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\dfrac{1.5 \\times 10^6}{E} \\text{ meters}", "expr2": "3.3 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\dfrac{1.5 \\times 10^6}{E} \\text{ meters}", "expr2": "\\frac{1.5 \\times 10^3}{E} \\, \\text{m}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\dfrac{1.5 \\times 10^6}{E} \\text{ meters}", "expr2": "1.82 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/4-3", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum kinetic energy of charge 6+ nitrogen ions accelerated by the Princeton synchrotron, which can produce protons with a total energy of 3 GeV. Hmm, I need to figure out how the energy relates to different ions. \n\nFirst, I remember that in a synchrotron, the maximum energy attainable by an ion depends on its charge and mass. The key factors here are the charge state of the ion and its mass compared to protons. Since the synchrotron uses magnetic fields to bend the particles, the charge-to-mass ratio (q/m) plays a crucial role. \n\nWait, the synchrotron's magnetic field strength and the radius of the orbit determine the maximum momentum a particle can have. The formula for the magnetic rigidity is Bρ = p/(q), where B is the magnetic field, ρ is the radius of curvature, p is the momentum, and q is the charge. But since the synchrotron has a fixed radius and maximum magnetic field, the maximum momentum a particle can reach is proportional to its charge times the magnetic rigidity. \n\nBut protons are being accelerated to 3 GeV total energy. Let me recall that the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. For a proton, the rest mass energy is about 0.938 GeV. So if the total energy is 3 GeV, the kinetic energy would be 3 - 0.938 ≈ 2.062 GeV. But maybe the problem is considering the total energy as the kinetic energy? Wait, the problem says \"nominal total energy 3 GeV\" for protons. So total energy E = 3 GeV. \n\nNow, for ions with different charge states and masses, how does the maximum energy scale? The maximum energy achievable in a synchrotron is limited by the magnetic field and the radius, which relates to the momentum. The momentum p is related to the total energy E by the relation E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². But since the synchrotron's maximum magnetic rigidity (Bρ) is fixed, the maximum momentum p is proportional to q * (Bρ). So p ∝ q. \n\nBut for different particles, the same magnetic rigidity (Bρ) would allow different momenta depending on their charge. So if the proton has charge +1, then for a nitrogen ion with charge +6, the momentum would be 6 times higher? Wait, no. Wait, Bρ = p/(q e), where e is the elementary charge. So p = q e Bρ. Therefore, for the same Bρ, p is proportional to q. \n\nBut the total energy E is related to p and the rest mass. So for each ion, the maximum p is q times the proton's charge (which is 1) times the same Bρ. So if the proton's maximum p is p_p = (E_p² - m_p² c^4)^(1/2) / c. Then for nitrogen ion, p_N = 6 p_p. \n\nWait, but the synchrotron's maximum Bρ is fixed. So if the proton is accelerated to a certain p_p, then for the nitrogen ion with charge 6+, the maximum p_N would be 6 times p_p. Because p = q * Bρ * e / c, perhaps? Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the magnetic rigidity. \n\nMagnetic rigidity is Bρ = p/(q e), where p is momentum, q is charge number, e is elementary charge. So if the synchrotron can reach a certain Bρ, then for protons (q=1), p_p = Bρ * e. For nitrogen ions with q=6, p_N = 6 * Bρ * e = 6 p_p. So the momentum of the nitrogen ion would be 6 times that of the proton. \n\nBut the total energy is related to momentum and rest mass. So for the proton, E_p = sqrt( (p_p c)^2 + (m_p c^2)^2 ) = 3 GeV. For the nitrogen ion, E_N = sqrt( (p_N c)^2 + (m_N c^2)^2 ) = sqrt( (6 p_p c)^2 + (m_N c^2)^2 ). \n\nBut we need to express p_p in terms of E_p. From E_p = 3 GeV, we have p_p c = sqrt( E_p² - (m_p c²)^2 ) = sqrt( (3)^2 - (0.938)^2 ) GeV. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, m_p c² ≈ 0.938 GeV. So E_p = 3 GeV. Then, p_p c = sqrt(3² - 0.938²) = sqrt(9 - 0.880) = sqrt(8.12) ≈ 2.85 GeV. Therefore, p_p ≈ 2.85 GeV/c. \n\nThen, p_N = 6 p_p ≈ 6 * 2.85 GeV/c ≈ 17.1 GeV/c. \n\nNow, the total energy of the nitrogen ion would be E_N = sqrt( (17.1 GeV)^2 + (m_N c²)^2 ). \n\nWhat's the rest mass of the nitrogen ion? The problem says it's ^14N, which has a mass number 14. The rest mass energy of a ^14N nucleus is approximately 14 atomic mass units times c². Since 1 u c² ≈ 931.5 MeV, so 14 * 931.5 MeV ≈ 13.041 GeV. So m_N c² ≈ 14 * 0.9315 GeV ≈ 13.041 GeV. \n\nTherefore, E_N = sqrt( (17.1)^2 + (13.041)^2 ) GeV. Let's compute that. \n\nFirst, 17.1 squared: 17.1 * 17.1 = 292.41. \n\n13.041 squared: 13.041 * 13.041 ≈ 170.07 (since 13^2=169, 0.041^2≈0.00168, cross terms 2*13*0.041≈1.066, so total ≈169 +1.066 +0.00168 ≈170.067). \n\nSo E_N ≈ sqrt(292.41 + 170.067) = sqrt(462.477) ≈ 21.5 GeV. \n\nTherefore, the total energy of the nitrogen ion is approximately 21.5 GeV. But the question asks for the maximum kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is total energy minus rest mass energy. \n\nSo K_N = E_N - m_N c² ≈ 21.5 GeV - 13.041 GeV ≈ 8.459 GeV. \n\nWait, but let me check the calculations again. \n\nWait, 17.1 squared: 17*17=289, 0.1*17*2=3.4, 0.1^2=0.01. So (17 + 0.1)^2 = 289 + 3.4 + 0.01 = 292.41. Correct. \n\n13.041 squared: Let's compute 13.041 * 13.041. \n\n13 * 13 = 169. \n\n13 * 0.041 = 0.533. \n\n0.041 * 13 = 0.533. \n\n0.041 * 0.041 = 0.001681. \n\nSo (13 + 0.041)^2 = 13^2 + 2*13*0.041 + 0.041^2 = 169 + 1.066 + 0.001681 ≈ 170.067681. So that's correct. \n\nSo 292.41 + 170.067681 ≈ 462.477681. Square root of that: sqrt(462.477681). Let's see. 21^2=441, 22^2=484. So between 21 and 22. Let's compute 21.5^2 = 462.25. Oh, that's very close. 21.5^2 = (21 + 0.5)^2 = 21² + 2*21*0.5 + 0.5² = 441 + 21 + 0.25 = 462.25. So sqrt(462.477681) ≈ 21.5 + (462.477681 - 462.25)/(2*21.5). The difference is 0.227681. The derivative of sqrt(x) at x=462.25 is 1/(2*21.5) ≈ 0.02326. So approximate sqrt ≈21.5 + 0.227681 * 0.02326 ≈21.5 + 0.0053 ≈21.5053 GeV. So E_N ≈21.505 GeV. \n\nThen, K_N = 21.505 -13.041 ≈8.464 GeV. So approximately 8.46 GeV. \n\nBut wait, the problem states \"charge 6+ ^14N ions\". So the charge is 6 times the proton charge. The key assumption here is that the magnetic rigidity (Bρ) is the same for both protons and nitrogen ions. Since the synchrotron's maximum Bρ is fixed, the maximum momentum p is proportional to the charge. Therefore, for nitrogen with charge +6, p_N =6 p_p. \n\nBut wait, the rest mass of the nitrogen ion is 14 times the proton mass (approximately, since a proton is about 1 u, and nitrogen-14 is 14 u). But actually, the proton mass is about 1.007276 u, and the nitrogen-14 mass is 14.003074 u. But for the sake of approximation, maybe we can take m_N ≈14 m_p. So m_N c² ≈14 *0.938 GeV ≈13.132 GeV. Wait, earlier I calculated 14 *0.9315 ≈13.041 GeV. Close enough. \n\nBut in any case, the exact value might depend on precise masses, but perhaps the problem expects us to approximate m_N as 14 m_p. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way to approach this. \n\nIn synchrotrons, the maximum kinetic energy for ions is often scaled by the charge-to-mass ratio (q/A), where A is the mass number. Because the energy gain per revolution depends on the charge, and the magnetic rigidity depends on q and mass. \n\nWait, another approach: The maximum energy is determined by the magnetic field and the radius. The magnetic rigidity Bρ = p/(q e), so p = q e Bρ. For a given Bρ (fixed by the machine), p is proportional to q. \n\nThe total energy E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). So for protons, E_p = sqrt( (q_p e Bρ c)^2 + (m_p c²)^2 ). For nitrogen, E_N = sqrt( (q_N e Bρ c)^2 + (m_N c²)^2 ). \n\nBut since q_N =6, and m_N ≈14 m_p. \n\nBut we can relate the two. Let's express Bρ from the proton's case: \n\nFor protons, E_p =3 GeV = sqrt( (q_p e Bρ c)^2 + (m_p c²)^2 ). Here, q_p=1. \n\nSo, (q_p e Bρ c) = sqrt( E_p² - (m_p c²)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(9 -0.880) ≈2.85 GeV/c. \n\nTherefore, e Bρ c = 2.85 GeV/c. \n\nThen, for nitrogen, q_N=6, so (q_N e Bρ c) =6 *2.85 GeV/c ≈17.1 GeV/c. \n\nThen, E_N = sqrt( (17.1)^2 + (13.041)^2 ) ≈21.5 GeV, as before. \n\nThus, the kinetic energy K_N = E_N - m_N c² ≈21.5 -13.041≈8.46 GeV. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"nominal total energy 3 GeV\" for protons. So maybe the 3 GeV is the total energy, not the kinetic. So the calculation above is correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the 3 GeV were the kinetic energy, then the total energy would be K_p + m_p c² =3 +0.938≈3.938 GeV. But the problem states \"nominal total energy 3 GeV\", so we take E_p=3 GeV. \n\nTherefore, the maximum kinetic energy for nitrogen ions would be approximately 8.46 GeV. \n\nBut let me check if there's another scaling factor. Sometimes, in cyclotrons and synchrotrons, the maximum energy scales with (q²)/A. Wait, why? Because the energy gain per turn is proportional to q, and the number of turns needed to reach a certain energy depends on the mass. But in a synchrotron, the frequency is adjusted, so maybe the scaling is different. \n\nAlternatively, the magnetic rigidity (Bρ) is fixed. For a given Bρ, the momentum p = (q/e) * Bρ * e = q Bρ (in units where e=1). So p ∝ q. \n\nThe kinetic energy K = E - m c² = sqrt( p² c² + m² c^4 ) - m c². \n\nFor non-relativistic particles, K ≈ p²/(2m), but for relativistic particles, K ≈ pc. \n\nIn this case, the proton's total energy is 3 GeV, which is about 3/0.938 ≈3.2 times its rest mass, so it's relativistic. The nitrogen ion's total energy would be sqrt( (6 p_p c)^2 + (14 m_p c²)^2 ). \n\nBut let's see, if the proton's momentum p_p c = sqrt(3² -0.938²) ≈2.85 GeV, then for nitrogen, p_N c =6*2.85≈17.1 GeV. \n\nThe rest mass of nitrogen is 14*0.938≈13.13 GeV. So E_N =sqrt(17.1² +13.13²)≈sqrt(292.41 +172.3)=sqrt(464.71)≈21.56 GeV. \n\nThen K_N=21.56 -13.13≈8.43 GeV. \n\nSo approximately 8.4 GeV. \n\nBut the problem might expect an exact answer. Let's compute more precisely. \n\nFirst, precise calculation for E_p=3 GeV, m_p=0.938 GeV/c². \n\np_p c = sqrt(E_p² - m_p²) = sqrt(9 -0.938²) = sqrt(9 -0.880) = sqrt(8.12) ≈2.85 GeV. \n\nThen, p_N c =6*2.85=17.1 GeV. \n\nm_N c²=14*0.938=13.132 GeV. \n\nE_N=sqrt(17.1² +13.132²). \n\nCompute 17.1²: 17.1*17.1=292.41. \n\n13.132²: Let's compute 13.132*13.132. \n\n13*13=169. \n\n13*0.132=1.716. \n\n0.132*13=1.716. \n\n0.132*0.132≈0.017424. \n\nSo total (13+0.132)^2=169 +2*1.716 +0.017424≈169+3.432+0.0174≈172.4494. \n\nThus, E_N=sqrt(292.41 +172.4494)=sqrt(464.8594)=approx 21.56 GeV. \n\nThen K_N=21.56 -13.132≈8.428 GeV. \n\nSo approximately 8.43 GeV. \n\nBut the problem might want the answer in a specific form. Let's check if there's a simpler way. \n\nAlternatively, since the magnetic rigidity is the same, the maximum velocity factor (gamma) might scale with q/A. Wait, but gamma is E/(m c²). For protons, gamma_p =3 /0.938≈3.2. For nitrogen, gamma_N =E_N/(14*0.938)=21.56/13.132≈1.64. \n\nBut that's not directly helpful. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider that for a given magnetic field and radius, the maximum momentum is proportional to q. So p = q * (Bρ). Then, the kinetic energy K = sqrt(p² + m²) - m. \n\nBut since p scales with q, and m scales with A (mass number), then K scales with q²/A. Wait, let's see. \n\nIf p = q * p_0 (where p_0 is the proton's momentum), then K = sqrt( (q p_0)^2 + (A m_p)^2 ) - A m_p. \n\nBut this doesn't simplify easily. However, if the momentum is much larger than the rest mass (ultra-relativistic), then K ≈ q p_0 c. But in this case, for nitrogen, p_N c=17.1 GeV, and m_N c²=13.13 GeV. So p_N c is about 1.3 times m_N c², so not ultra-relativistic. Therefore, the approximation K≈pc isn't valid here. \n\nThus, the precise calculation is necessary. \n\nTherefore, the maximum kinetic energy is approximately 8.43 GeV. \n\nBut let me check if there's a different approach. For example, the maximum energy per nucleon. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention per nucleon. \n\nAlternatively, the synchrotron's voltage or something else. But no, the key is that the magnetic rigidity limits the momentum, which depends on charge. \n\nYes, I think the approach is correct. The answer should be approximately 8.4 GeV. \n\nBut let me check units and everything. The charge is 6+, so q=6. The mass number is 14, so A=14. The rest mass energy is 14 * m_p c². \n\nYes. So the calculation seems right. \n\nSo the final answer is approximately 8.43 GeV. Rounding to two decimal places, 8.43 GeV. But maybe the problem expects an exact expression. Let's see. \n\nAlternatively, express the answer in terms of the proton's total energy. \n\nGiven E_p =3 GeV, m_p=0.938 GeV. \n\nThen p_p c = sqrt(3² -0.938²) ≈2.85 GeV. \n\np_N c=6*2.85=17.1 GeV. \n\nE_N= sqrt( (17.1)^2 + (14*0.938)^2 ). \n\nCompute 14*0.938=13.132. \n\nSo E_N= sqrt(17.1² +13.132²)=sqrt(292.41 +172.449)=sqrt(464.859)=21.56 GeV. \n\nK_N=21.56 -13.132=8.428 GeV. \n\nSo approximately 8.43 GeV. \n\nBut perhaps the answer should be written as 8.4 GeV. However, given the options, maybe the exact value is needed. Alternatively, the problem might expect a different approach where the kinetic energy scales with (q²)/(A). \n\nWait, let's think differently. If the maximum velocity is the same, then kinetic energy scales with mass. But that's not the case here. \n\nAlternatively, the acceleration in a synchrotron depends on the charge and the mass. The energy gain per turn is ΔE = q V, where V is the voltage. But over many turns, the total energy gained would depend on q and the number of times the particle passes through the accelerating gap. However, in a synchrotron, the frequency is adjusted to match the particle's increasing velocity, so the number of passes is roughly the same for different particles. But this might not directly affect the maximum energy, which is limited by the magnetic field and radius. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum kinetic energy is given by K = (q/A)² * K_p * (A). Wait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the magnetic rigidity Bρ = p/(q e), so p = q e Bρ. For protons, p_p = e Bρ. For nitrogen, p_N =6 e Bρ. \n\nThe kinetic energy K = sqrt( p² c² + m² c^4 ) - m c². \n\nExpressed in terms of the proton's parameters: \n\nFor protons: \n\nE_p = sqrt( p_p² c² + m_p² c^4 ) =3 GeV. \n\nFor nitrogen: \n\nE_N = sqrt( (6 p_p c)^2 + (14 m_p c²)^2 ). \n\nThen, K_N = E_N -14 m_p c². \n\nBut we can express p_p c from the proton's total energy: \n\np_p c = sqrt( E_p² - m_p² c^4 ) = sqrt(3² -0.938²) ≈2.85 GeV. \n\nSo substituting into E_N: \n\nE_N = sqrt( (6*2.85)^2 + (14*0.938)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(17.1² +13.132²)≈21.56 GeV. \n\nThus, K_N≈21.56 -13.13≈8.43 GeV. \n\nYes, this seems consistent. \n\nTherefore, the maximum kinetic energy of the charge 6+ ^14N ions is approximately 8.43 GeV. \n\nBut let me check if there's a simpler way the problem might expect. For example, if the maximum energy is proportional to q²/A. \n\nIf K ∝ q²/A, then K_N = (q²/A) * K_p. \n\nBut for protons, K_p =3 GeV -0.938 GeV≈2.062 GeV. \n\nThen K_N= (6²/14)*2.062≈(36/14)*2.062≈2.571*2.062≈5.3 GeV. \n\nBut this contradicts our previous result. So this approach is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, if the total energy scales with q, then E_N =6 *3 GeV=18 GeV. Then K_N=18 -13.132≈4.87 GeV. But this is also incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is the one considering the momentum scaling with charge and then calculating the total energy and subtracting rest mass. \n\nThus, the answer should be approximately 8.43 GeV. Rounding to two significant figures, since the given energy is 3 GeV (one significant figure?), but 3 GeV is probably an exact value here. Wait, the problem states \"nominal total energy 3 GeV\", which might be considered as a precise value. However, the rest mass of the proton is approximate. But in any case, the answer is around 8.4 GeV. \n\nAlternatively, using more precise rest mass values. \n\nThe actual rest mass of a proton is 938.272 MeV/c², so 0.938272 GeV. \n\nThe rest mass of ^14N is 14.003074 u. \n\n1 u =931.494 MeV/c². \n\nSo m_N c²=14.003074 *931.494 MeV≈14.003074 *0.931494 GeV≈13.043 GeV. \n\nThen, E_N= sqrt( (17.1)^2 + (13.043)^2 )≈sqrt(292.41 +170.12)=sqrt(462.53)≈21.506 GeV. \n\nK_N=21.506 -13.043≈8.463 GeV. \n\nSo approximately 8.46 GeV. \n\nBut given that the problem provides the proton's total energy as 3 GeV, which is precise, and the nitrogen is ^14N with charge 6+, the answer should be approximately 8.5 GeV. But the precise calculation gives around 8.46 GeV. \n\nDepending on rounding, the answer could be written as 8.5 GeV. However, in exams, sometimes they expect an exact expression. Let's see if there's a way to write it symbolically. \n\nAlternatively, using variables: \n\nE_N = sqrt( (6 sqrt(E_p² - m_p²))² + (A m_p)^2 ) - A m_p. \n\nBut this might not simplify nicely. \n\nAlternatively, plugging in the numbers: \n\nE_p=3 GeV, m_p=0.938 GeV, A=14, q=6. \n\nE_N = sqrt( (6*sqrt(3² -0.938²))² + (14*0.938)^2 ) -14*0.938. \n\nBut this is complicated. \n\nAlternatively, compute it step by step: \n\nsqrt(3² -0.938²)=sqrt(9 -0.880)=sqrt(8.12)=2.85. \n\nThen 6*2.85=17.1. \n\nsqrt(17.1² + (14*0.938)^2)=sqrt(292.41 + (13.132)^2)=sqrt(292.41 +172.449)=sqrt(464.859)=21.56. \n\n21.56 -13.132=8.428. \n\nSo approximately 8.43 GeV. \n\nGiven that, the answer is approximately 8.4 GeV. But the problem might expect an exact answer in terms of the given numbers. However, since the problem doesn't specify using exact masses or approximate, we'll go with the calculated value. \n\nTherefore, the maximum kinetic energy is approximately 8.4 GeV. \n\nBut wait, let me check one more time. \n\nIf the proton's total energy is 3 GeV, then its gamma factor is 3 /0.938≈3.198. \n\nThe nitrogen's gamma factor is E_N/(14*0.938)=21.56/13.132≈1.64. \n\nBut the relation between gamma and the magnetic field isn't straightforward here. \n\nAlternatively, since the magnetic rigidity is the same, the velocity v can be related. \n\nThe magnetic rigidity Bρ = p/(q e) = (gamma m v)/(q e). \n\nBut v = beta c. So Bρ = (gamma m beta c)/(q e). \n\nFor different particles, if Bρ is fixed, then (gamma beta)/q = (m e c)/(gamma m beta c) ? Wait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, for fixed Bρ, (gamma beta m)/q = constant. \n\nSo (gamma beta m)_p / q_p = (gamma beta m)_N / q_N. \n\nBut this might not help directly. \n\nAlternatively, (gamma beta) is proportional to q/(m). \n\nBut this is getting too complicated. \n\nThe initial approach was correct: momentum scales with charge, then compute total energy and subtract rest mass. \n\nThus, the answer is approximately 8.4 GeV. \n\nBut let me check with exact values. \n\nGiven: \n\nE_p =3 GeV (proton's total energy) \n\nm_p c²=0.938 GeV \n\nq_N=6 \n\nA=14 \n\nm_N c²=14 *0.938=13.132 GeV \n\np_p c= sqrt(E_p² -m_p²)=sqrt(9 -0.880)=sqrt(8.12)=2.85 GeV \n\np_N c=6 *2.85=17.1 GeV \n\nE_N= sqrt( (17.1)^2 + (13.132)^2 )=sqrt(292.41 +172.449)=sqrt(464.859)=21.56 GeV \n\nK_N=21.56 -13.132=8.428 GeV \n\nSo, 8.428 GeV rounds to 8.43 GeV. Depending on significant figures, since the problem gives 3 GeV (one significant figure?), but likely it's considered as precise, so we can keep two decimal places. \n\nBut in exams, often the answer is expected to be in two significant figures. 3 GeV has one significant figure, but maybe the rest masses are known more precisely. However, since the problem doesn't specify, we'll go with 8.4 GeV. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be expressed as (6²/14)* (3 GeV -0.938 GeV) + ... but no, that approach was incorrect. \n\nThus, the correct answer is approximately 8.4 GeV. \n\nBut wait, let me check one more thing. If the synchrotron can accelerate protons to 3 GeV total energy, which includes their rest mass, then the maximum energy for another ion is determined by the same magnetic rigidity. Therefore, the momentum is proportional to the charge, and the total energy is calculated from that momentum and the ion's rest mass. \n\nYes, that's exactly what we did. So the answer is 8.4 GeV. \n\nBut let me confirm with another example. Suppose we have a proton with total energy E_p, then for an ion with charge q and mass number A, the maximum total energy E_ion is sqrt( (q p_p c)^2 + (A m_p c²)^2 ), and the kinetic energy is E_ion - A m_p c². \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is approximately 8.4 GeV. \n\nBut in the calculation, we got 8.428 GeV, which is approximately 8.43 GeV. Depending on rounding, it's either 8.4 or 8.43. Since the problem might expect two decimal places, but given that the initial data (3 GeV) is possibly two significant figures (if written as 3.0 GeV), but it's written as 3 GeV. \n\nIn conclusion, the maximum kinetic energy is approximately 8.4 GeV. \n\nBut to match the precise calculation, 8.43 GeV. However, in the absence of more precise data, 8.4 GeV is acceptable. \n\nBut let me check if the answer is exactly 8.4 GeV. \n\nWait, 8.428 is closer to 8.4 than 8.5. So 8.4 GeV is appropriate. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect an answer of 8.4 GeV. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{8.4 \\text{ GeV}}.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum kinetic energy of charge \\(6^+\\) \\(^{14}\\text{N}\\) ions accelerated by the Princeton synchrotron can be determined by considering the relationship between momentum, charge, and rest mass energy. \n\n1. **Proton Parameters**:\n   - Total energy of protons, \\(E_p = 3 \\, \\text{GeV}\\)\n   - Rest mass energy of a proton, \\(m_p c^2 = 0.938 \\, \\text{GeV}\\)\n   - Momentum of the proton, \\(p_p c = \\sqrt{E_p^2 - (m_p c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 - 0.938^2} \\approx 2.85 \\, \\text{GeV}\\)\n\n2. **Nitrogen Ion Parameters**:\n   - Charge of nitrogen ion, \\(q = 6\\)\n   - Mass number of nitrogen, \\(A = 14\\)\n   - Rest mass energy of nitrogen ion, \\(m_N c^2 = 14 \\times 0.938 \\, \\text{GeV} \\approx 13.132 \\, \\text{GeV}\\)\n   - Momentum of nitrogen ion, \\(p_N c = 6 \\times p_p c = 6 \\times 2.85 \\, \\text{GeV} \\approx 17.1 \\, \\text{GeV}\\)\n\n3. **Total Energy of Nitrogen Ion**:\n   \\[\n   E_N = \\sqrt{(p_N c)^2 + (m_N c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{17.1^2 + 13.132^2} \\approx \\sqrt{292.41 + 172.449} \\approx 21.56 \\, \\text{GeV}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Kinetic Energy of Nitrogen Ion**:\n   \\[\n   K_N = E_N - m_N c^2 = 21.56 \\, \\text{GeV} - 13.132 \\, \\text{GeV} \\approx 8.428 \\, \\text{GeV}\n   \\]\n\nRounding to two significant figures, the maximum kinetic energy of the \\(6^+\\) \\(^{14}\\text{N}\\) ions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{8.4 \\text{ GeV}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["8.4 \\text{ GeV}", "8.4 \\text{ GeV}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "8.4 \\text{ GeV}", "expr2": "8.43 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "8.4 \\text{ GeV}", "expr2": "8.43 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/2-42", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question about breeder reactors. Hmm, first, I need to explain how a breeder reactor operates. From what I remember, a breeder reactor is different from conventional nuclear reactors because it produces more fissile material than it consumes. Wait, right, that's the key point. So, it generates fuel as it operates.\n\nThe process involves nuclear reactions where fertile material, like Uranium-238 or Thorium-232, gets converted into fissile isotopes, such as Plutonium-239 or Uranium-233. So, in a breeder reactor, when the fissile material like Plutonium-239 undergoes fission, it releases neutrons. These neutrons are then captured by the fertile material surrounding the core, breeding more fissile material. That's the basic operation.\n\nNow, the second part asks about the physical constant of the fission process that's a prerequisite for breeding. I think this has to do with the number of neutrons released per fission. In regular reactors, you need enough neutrons to sustain the chain reaction, but for breeding, you need extra neutrons to convert the fertile material. So the important constant here is the neutron reproduction factor, often denoted as η (eta). Specifically, η must be greater than 2. Because each fission event needs to produce enough neutrons: one to sustain the chain reaction, and at least one more to be absorbed by the fertile material to breed new fuel. If η is less than 2, breeding isn't possible because there aren't enough neutrons to both sustain the reaction and create new fuel.\n\nThe third part is about the constraint on materials, especially whether water can be a moderator. Moderators slow down neutrons to thermal energies, which increases the likelihood of fission in some reactors. But in breeder reactors, they typically use fast neutrons instead of thermal ones. Because if you slow down the neutrons, their cross-section for absorption in fertile material (like U-238) is lower. Fast reactors don't use a moderator; they rely on fast neutrons. So using a moderator like water would slow the neutrons, which is not desirable in a fast breeder reactor. Therefore, water can't be used as a moderator in such reactors. Instead, liquid metals like sodium are used as coolants because they don't moderate neutrons much.\n\nWait, but why exactly can't water be used? Because water acts as a moderator, slowing neutrons down. In a breeder reactor that relies on fast neutrons to efficiently cause fission and breed more fuel, slowing the neutrons would reduce the η value. Since thermal neutrons have lower probability of causing fission in Pu-239 compared to fast neutrons, maybe? Or is it that the absorption cross-section of U-238 is higher for fast neutrons? Wait, no, U-238 has a higher cross-section for neutron capture at higher energies? Let me think. U-238 tends to capture neutrons more readily at higher energies (in the keV range, maybe), which is the fast spectrum. So, in a fast breeder reactor, the fast neutrons are more likely to be captured by U-238 to produce Pu-239. If you thermalize the neutrons, the capture in U-238 is less likely, and the neutrons are more likely to be absorbed by other materials or cause fission in existing fissile material. But the key is that for breeding, you need those extra neutrons to be captured by fertile material. If the moderator slows the neutrons, then the reactor becomes a thermal reactor, which might not have a high enough η to breed. Because thermal reactors using U-235 have η around 2.07, which is barely enough, but maybe in practice, you need higher η. Alternatively, maybe in fast reactors, the η is higher because the fission of Pu-239 with fast neutrons releases more neutrons per fission. Let me check: For Pu-239, the average number of neutrons per fission (ν) is about 3.0 for fast neutrons, compared to around 2.7 for thermal. So η, which is ν multiplied by the probability that a neutron causes fission rather than being absorbed or leaking, would be higher in a fast reactor. Therefore, to achieve η > 2, you need fast neutrons. Hence, using a moderator like water would reduce neutron energy, lower η, making breeding impossible. Therefore, the constraint is that the reactor must use a fast neutron spectrum, so moderators like water can't be used. Instead, materials that don't slow neutrons much are needed. So the important constraint is that the reactor must operate with fast neutrons, requiring the absence of a moderator. Hence, water cannot be used as a moderator in a breeder reactor.\n\nPutting it all together: breeder reactors produce more fissile material than they consume by converting fertile isotopes. The prerequisite physical constant is the neutron reproduction factor η > 2. The constraint is using materials that don't moderate neutrons, so water isn't suitable as a moderator.\n</think>\n\nA breeder reactor operates by converting non-fissile fertile material (such as Uranium-238 or Thorium-232) into fissile isotopes (Plutonium-239 or Uranium-233) through neutron capture. This process occurs as the reactor generates energy from fission, with excess neutrons absorbed by the fertile material to \"breed\" new fuel.  \n\nThe critical physical constant enabling breeding is the **neutron reproduction factor (η)**, which must exceed 2. This ensures that each fission event produces enough neutrons: one to sustain the chain reaction and at least one more to breed new fissile material.  \n\nA key constraint is that the reactor must operate with **fast neutrons** (high-energy neutrons) rather than thermal neutrons. Fast neutrons optimize the probability of fertile material capturing neutrons while maintaining a high η. Consequently, moderators like water, which slow neutrons to thermal energies, cannot be used. Instead, coolants such as liquid sodium are employed, as they do not significantly moderate neutron energy.  \n\n**Final Answer:**  \nA breeder reactor converts fertile material into fissile fuel. The prerequisite constant is the neutron reproduction factor \\( \\eta > 2 \\). Water cannot be used as a moderator because breeding requires fast neutrons.  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\eta > 2}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\eta > 2"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\eta > 2", "expr2": "\\eta > 2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "eta > 2", "expr2": "eta > 2"}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": "unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'StrictGreaterThan' and 'StrictGreaterThan'"}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-39", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these physics questions one by one. Starting with part (a): What is the energy of the neutrino in a typical beta decay?\n\nHmm, beta decay involves the transformation of a neutron into a proton, emitting an electron and a neutrino. Wait, but in beta decay, the neutrino (or antineutrino, depending on beta minus or plus) is emitted along with the electron. But the energy of the neutrino... I remember that in beta decay, the energy released is shared between the electron, the neutrino, and the recoiling nucleus. However, because the nucleus is much more massive, its recoil energy is negligible. So the total energy available is the Q-value of the decay. But the neutrino's energy would depend on how the energy is partitioned between the electron and neutrino. But wait, in typical beta decay, the electron can have a range of energies up to a maximum, which is the Q-value. But since the neutrino carries away some energy, the electron's energy isn't fixed. So the neutrino's energy would vary from almost zero up to the Q-value. But the question asks for the energy of the neutrino in a typical beta decay. Wait, maybe \"typical\" here refers to the average energy? Or maybe the maximum energy? Wait, but the neutrino can take any energy from zero up to the maximum, so the average might be around half the maximum. But I'm not sure. Wait, but in reality, the energy distribution of the electron is continuous, which led Pauli to propose the existence of the neutrino. So the neutrino's energy would be the Q-value minus the electron's kinetic energy. But if the electron has a maximum kinetic energy equal to Q, then when the electron has maximum energy, the neutrino's energy is zero. Conversely, when the electron has minimal energy, the neutrino takes most of the energy. So the neutrino's energy can vary. But the question is asking for a typical value. Maybe the answer is that the neutrino's energy is of the order of MeV, similar to the Q-value of the decay. For example, in a typical beta decay like the decay of a free neutron, the Q-value is about 0.782 MeV. So the maximum energy the electron can have is around that, but the average might be lower. But the neutrino would then have an average energy of about half of that? Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the neutrino's energy is on the order of MeV, but varies depending on the specific decay. Wait, but the question says \"the energy\" as if there's a specific value. Maybe the answer is that the neutrino's energy is not fixed, but in a typical beta decay, the maximum energy (Q-value) is shared between the electron and neutrino. So the neutrino can have energy up to the Q-value. But the question is phrased as \"the energy of the neutrino\", which might be ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the neutrino's energy is approximately 0.782 MeV, which is the maximum for free neutron decay. But I need to check. Wait, but in reality, the average energy of the neutrino would be around a third of the Q-value. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall: in beta decay, the energy distribution of the electrons is a spectrum, and the neutrino takes away the remaining energy. The maximum electron energy is Q, and the neutrino's energy would be Q minus the electron's kinetic energy. So the neutrino's energy can be anything from zero up to Q. But the question is asking for the energy of the neutrino in a typical beta decay. Maybe \"typical\" here refers to the average. For example, in free neutron decay, the average electron energy is about 0.3 MeV, so the average neutrino energy would be Q (0.782 MeV) minus that, so around 0.48 MeV. But I'm not sure if that's considered typical. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the neutrino's energy is of the same order as the Q-value, which is typically a few MeV. But perhaps the answer is that the neutrino's energy is not fixed and varies from zero up to the maximum energy (Q-value) of the decay. Wait, but the question is part (a), so maybe the answer is that the neutrino's energy is a significant fraction of the Q-value, but varies. However, the question might expect a numerical value. Wait, maybe the answer is that in a typical beta decay, the neutrino's energy is around 0.5 MeV. But I need to check. For example, in the beta decay of Carbon-14, the Q-value is about 0.156 MeV. So the maximum energy the electron can have is 0.156 MeV, and the neutrino would take the rest. But in that case, the neutrino's energy would vary. So perhaps the answer is that the energy of the neutrino in a typical beta decay varies, but the maximum energy is equal to the Q-value of the decay, which is typically on the order of MeV. However, the question is phrased as \"the energy\", so maybe the answer is that the neutrino's energy is approximately half of the Q-value. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the neutrino's energy is not fixed and depends on the decay, but the maximum possible energy is the Q-value. But the question is part (a), so perhaps the answer is that the neutrino's energy is a few hundred keV to a few MeV, depending on the specific decay. But I need to check standard beta decay energies. For example, in the decay of a free neutron, the Q-value is about 0.782 MeV. The average electron energy is about 0.3 MeV, so the average neutrino energy would be around 0.48 MeV. But in other beta decays, like those in nuclear reactors, the Q-values can be higher. For example, the beta decay of ^137Cs has a Q-value around 1.176 MeV, so the neutrino could have up to that energy. But the answer might be that the neutrino's energy is of the order of MeV. However, the question is about a \"typical\" beta decay. So maybe the answer is that the neutrino's energy is on the order of 1 MeV. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me move on to part (b) and come back if needed.\n\nPart (b): What is the dependence on atomic number Z of the lifetime for spontaneous decay of the 2p state in hydrogen-like atoms H, He+, Li++, etc.?\n\nHydrogen-like atoms have a nucleus with charge Ze and a single electron. The spontaneous decay lifetime for an excited state depends on the transition probability. The transition probability for electric dipole (E1) transitions is given by the Einstein coefficient A, which is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element and the cube of the transition frequency. The lifetime τ is inversely proportional to A.\n\nFor hydrogen-like atoms, the transition frequency ν (or angular frequency ω) for a transition from n=2 to n=1 (since 2p is the excited state) would be proportional to Z². Because the energy levels scale as Z² (since E_n ∝ -Z²/n²), so the frequency difference between n=2 and n=1 is proportional to Z².\n\nThe dipole matrix element for the transition from 2p to 1s would involve the integral of r times the wavefunctions. The radial part of the wavefunction for hydrogen-like atoms scales as Z^(-3/2) because the Bohr radius a0 scales as 1/Z. So the radial wavefunction R(n,l) scales as (Z/a0)^(3/2) times some function of r. Therefore, the dipole matrix element (which involves r) would scale as Z^(-1/2). Because the matrix element is proportional to <r> which scales as a0/Z, but wait, let's think again. The dipole operator is e r, so the matrix element would be proportional to the integral of r ψ_1s* ψ_2p. The 1s and 2p wavefunctions for hydrogen-like atoms have radial parts that depend on Z. The 1s wavefunction is proportional to Z^(3/2) exp(-Zr/a0), and the 2p wavefunction is proportional to Z^(3/2) (Zr/a0) exp(-Zr/(2a0)). So when you compute the integral of r times these wavefunctions, the Z dependence would come out. Let's see: the integral would involve terms like Z^(3/2) * Z^(3/2) * (Z/a0) * integral over r of r^3 exp(-Zr/a0 ...). Wait, maybe it's easier to recall that the dipole matrix element for hydrogen-like atoms scales as Z^{-1}. Because the Bohr radius a0 is inversely proportional to Z, so r ~ a0/Z, so the dipole moment e r scales as e a0/Z. Therefore, the matrix element squared would scale as (e a0/Z)^2. Then the Einstein coefficient A is proportional to (matrix element squared) * (frequency^3). The frequency scales as Z², so frequency^3 is Z^6. Therefore, A ∝ (Z^{-2}) * Z^6 = Z^4. Therefore, the transition rate A is proportional to Z^4, so the lifetime τ (which is 1/A) is proportional to Z^{-4}. So the lifetime decreases with Z^4. Therefore, the dependence on Z is τ ∝ 1/Z^4. So the answer for part (b) is that the lifetime is proportional to Z^{-4}, or inversely proportional to Z^4.\n\nNow part (c): What is the electron configuration, total spin S, total orbital angular momentum L, total angular momentum J of the ground state of atomic oxygen?\n\nOxygen has atomic number 8. The electron configuration for neutral oxygen is 1s² 2s² 2p⁴. Since it's a p^4 configuration. For p electrons, l=1. The p subshell can hold 6 electrons (since l=1 has m_l = -1, 0, +1, each with two electrons). But oxygen has 4 p electrons, which is two less than half-filled (which would be 6). Alternatively, sometimes it's considered as two holes in the p subshell. For determining the ground state term symbols, we use Hund's rules. For equivalent p electrons (here, 2p^4), the maximum spin S is achieved by having the maximum number of parallel spins. For p^4, which is equivalent to p^2 holes, Hund's first rule says that the maximum S is achieved by putting the holes (since it's easier to think of holes) with parallel spins. For two holes in p orbitals, the maximum S is 1 (since two spins parallel: each has s=1/2, so total S=1). Then, the maximum L is achieved by arranging the holes to have the maximum possible orbital angular momentum. For two p holes, the possible L values are the same as for two p electrons. The possible L for two p electrons (l=1 each) are L=2, 1, 0. Hund's second rule says to choose the maximum L. So maximum L is 2 (D term). Then, the total spin S=1 (triplet), and L=2 (D), so the term symbol is ^3D. Then, the J value is determined by Hund's third rule. For less than half-filled shells (p^4 is more than half-filled? Wait, p subshell can hold 6 electrons. Half-filled is 3 electrons. So p^4 is more than half-filled. Wait, p^4 is 4 electrons, which is two less than 6. So when the shell is more than half-filled, the lowest J is |L - S|. Wait, Hund's third rule states that for a given term, the level with the lowest J has the lowest energy if the subshell is less than half-filled, and the highest J if the subshell is more than half-filled. Wait, p^4 is more than half-filled (since half is 3), so the ground state term will have J = L + S. So for ^3D term, L=2, S=1. So possible J values are from |2-1| to 2+1, i.e., J=1, 2, 3. Since the subshell is more than half-filled, we choose the highest J, which is 3. Therefore, the term symbol is ^3D_3. But wait, wait. Wait, oxygen's ground state term symbol is actually known to be ^3P. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. For p^4 electrons, which is equivalent to two holes. For two holes, the possible terms are the same as for two electrons. For two p electrons, the possible terms are ^1S, ^1D, ^3P. Wait, no. Wait, for two electrons (or two holes), the possible terms are determined by the Pauli exclusion principle. Let's recall that for two equivalent p electrons (l=1), the possible terms are ^1S, ^1D, and ^3P. Wait, but Hund's first rule says maximum S. So for two electrons, the maximum S is 1 (since two electrons can have parallel spins if they are in different orbitals). Wait, but for two electrons in p orbitals, the maximum S is 1 (each electron has s=1/2, so total S=1). Then, the maximum L is 1 (since for two electrons with m_l values adding to maximum, but with different m_l's). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's do it properly. For two p electrons, the possible combinations are:\n\nTo find the possible terms, we need to consider all possible combinations of m_l and m_s, ensuring the Pauli exclusion principle. But a quicker way is to note that for two electrons in a p subshell, the possible terms are ^1S, ^1D, and ^3P. Hund's rules tell us that the term with the highest spin (^3P) has the lowest energy. So the ground state term for two p electrons is ^3P. But in our case, we have p^4, which is equivalent to two holes. The terms for two holes would be the same as for two electrons. So the ground state term for p^4 is also ^3P. Therefore, the total spin S=1 (since triplet term), L=1 (P term), and then J. Since the subshell is more than half-filled (p^4 is more than half of 6, which is 3), so J = L + S = 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, the term symbol is ^3P_2. Wait, but oxygen's ground state is actually ^3P_2. Let me confirm. Yes, atomic oxygen has a ground state electron configuration of 2p^4. The terms for p^4 are the same as p^2 (since four electrons can be considered as two holes). For p^2, the terms are ^3P, ^1D, ^1S. Hund's first rule says the highest spin (^3P) is the ground state. Then, since the p^4 is more than half-filled, J = L + S. L=1 (P), S=1. So J=2. Therefore, the term symbol is ^3P_2. So the total spin S=1, total orbital angular momentum L=1, total angular momentum J=2. Therefore, the electron configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p⁴, S=1, L=1, J=2.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For p^4:\n\nThe possible terms are the same as p^2 (since 4 = 6 - 2). For p^2, the possible terms are ^1S, ^1D, ^3P. Applying Hund's rules:\n\n1. Maximum S: for p^2, the maximum S is 1 (since two electrons can have parallel spins in different orbitals). So ^3P has S=1.\n\n2. For maximum L given that S=1: the maximum L for p^2 is 1 (P). Because arranging the two electrons in m_l=+1 and 0 would give L=1 (since m_l total is +1 +0 = +1). Alternatively, arranging them in m_l=+1 and -1 would give L=0. But to maximize L, you need to have the highest possible m_l. So putting one electron in m_l=+1 and another in m_l=0 gives total m_l=+1, which corresponds to L=1. So the term with maximum L is P. So the ^3P term.\n\n3. For J: since the subshell is more than half-filled (p^4 is more than half of 6, which is 3), J = L + S = 1 + 1 = 2. So the term symbol is ^3P_2.\n\nTherefore, the answer for part (c) is electron configuration 1s² 2s² 2p⁴, S=1, L=1, J=2.\n\nGoing back to part (a), I think the answer is that the neutrino's energy varies from zero up to the maximum energy (Q-value) of the decay, which is typically around 0.1 to a few MeV. But the question asks for \"the energy\", which might expect a more specific answer. However, since beta decay has a continuous spectrum, the neutrino's energy isn't fixed. So the answer is that the neutrino's energy can range from zero up to the maximum energy available in the decay, which is typically on the order of MeV. But maybe the answer is that the neutrino's energy is approximately equal to the Q-value of the decay. Wait, but that's only when the electron's kinetic energy is zero, which is not typical. Alternatively, the average energy might be around half the Q-value. But I think the correct answer is that the neutrino's energy is not fixed and varies, but the maximum energy is equal to the Q-value of the decay. However, the question might expect a numerical value. For example, in free neutron decay, the maximum neutrino energy is about 0.782 MeV. But in other beta decays, like those in nuclear reactors, the Q-values can be higher. However, the question says \"a typical beta decay\", so maybe the answer is that the neutrino's energy is on the order of 1 MeV. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the answer might be that the neutrino carries away approximately two-thirds of the energy, but I need to check. Wait, in beta decay, the average energy of the neutrino is about 0.26 MeV for neutron decay (Q=0.782 MeV), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the neutrino's energy is of the same order as the beta particle's energy, which is up to the Q-value. But since the question is part (a), perhaps the answer is that the neutrino's energy is up to the maximum energy determined by the decay's Q-value, typically around 0.1 to a few MeV. But the precise answer might be that the energy of the neutrino in a typical beta decay is of the order of 1 MeV. However, I think the more accurate answer is that the neutrino's energy varies from zero to the Q-value, which depends on the specific decay, but in a typical case, it's on the order of MeV. But since the question is part (a), maybe the answer is that the neutrino's energy is approximately 0.5 MeV. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, the answer might be that the neutrino's energy is not fixed and depends on the decay, but the maximum is the Q-value. However, the question might expect a numerical value. Let me check a reference. For example, in the beta decay of the neutron, the maximum energy is about 0.782 MeV, and the average neutrino energy is about 0.48 MeV. So maybe the answer is that the neutrino's energy is approximately 0.5 MeV. But I'm not sure if that's considered typical. Alternatively, the answer is that the neutrino's energy is not fixed and varies, but the maximum is the Q-value. So the answer would be that the neutrino's energy can range from zero up to the Q-value of the decay, which is typically on the order of MeV. But the question says \"the energy\", which might imply a specific value. Hmm. Maybe the answer is that the neutrino's energy is approximately 1 MeV.

Alternatively, the answer might be that the neutrino's energy is not fixed and varies, but the average is about half the Q-value. But I'm not sure. Given that, I'll proceed with the answers I have.\n</think>\n\n(a) In a typical beta decay, the neutrino's energy is not fixed and varies from zero up to the maximum energy available (the Q-value of the decay). The Q-value depends on the specific decay but is typically on the order of 0.1 to a few MeV.

{"id": "atomic/2-9", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these two physics problems. Starting with part (a): calculating the electrostatic energy of a charge Q uniformly distributed throughout a sphere of radius R. Hmm, I remember that the electrostatic energy, or the energy required to assemble the charge distribution, can be found by integrating the electric field's energy density over all space. The formula for energy is (1/2)ε₀ times the integral of E squared over volume. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the electric field inside and outside a uniformly charged sphere. Inside the sphere (r ≤ R), the electric field E should be proportional to r, right? Because for a uniform charge density, the enclosed charge grows with the cube of the radius. So, using Gauss's Law: E * 4πr² = (Q/( (4/3)πR³ )) * (4/3)πr³ ) / ε₀. Let me check that. The charge enclosed within radius r is Q*(r³/R³). So, Gauss's Law gives E = (Q r³)/(4π ε₀ R³ r²) ) = Q r / (4π ε₀ R³) * (1/r²)? Wait, maybe I should re-derive it properly.\n\nThe charge density ρ is Q divided by the volume of the sphere: ρ = 3Q/(4πR³). Then, the charge enclosed in radius r is (4/3)πr³ * ρ = (4/3)πr³ * (3Q/(4πR³)) ) = Q r³/R³. So, applying Gauss's Law: E * 4πr² = Q r³/(ε₀ R³). Solving for E gives E = (Q r)/(4π ε₀ R³). So inside the sphere, E increases linearly with r.\n\nOutside the sphere (r ≥ R), the electric field is the same as a point charge: E = Q/(4π ε₀ r²).\n\nNow, the energy U is (ε₀/2) ∫ E² dV over all space. So we need to split the integral into two parts: from 0 to R (inside the sphere) and from R to infinity (outside). Wait, but wait, the charge is distributed throughout the sphere, so the electric field inside is due to the charge inside, and outside is due to the total charge. But the energy is the work done to assemble the charge, so we need to calculate the energy stored in the entire electric field.\n\nSo, let's compute the integral. First, inside the sphere (0 to R):\n\nE_inside = (Q r)/(4π ε₀ R³) = (k Q r)/R³, where k = 1/(4π ε₀). Wait, maybe better to keep it in terms of ε₀. So E_inside = (Q r)/(4π ε₀ R³). Then, E² = Q² r²/(16 π² ε₀² R^6). The volume element dV is 4π r² dr. So the integral inside becomes:\n\nIntegral from 0 to R of (ε₀/2) * (Q² r²)/(16 π² ε₀² R^6) * 4π r² dr.\n\nSimplify this expression. Let's compute step by step:\n\nFirst, (ε₀/2) * (1/(16 π² ε₀²)) * 4π = (ε₀ / 2) * (4π) / (16 π² ε₀²) ) = (4π ε₀) / (32 π² ε₀²) ) = 1/(8 π ε₀). Then, the remaining terms are Q² r² / R^6 * r² dr = Q² r^4 / R^6 dr. So the integral inside is (1/(8 π ε₀)) * Q² / R^6 ∫ from 0 to R of r^4 dr. The integral of r^4 dr from 0 to R is R^5/5. So the inside integral becomes (1/(8 π ε₀)) * Q² R^5/(5 R^6) ) = Q²/(40 π ε₀ R).\n\nNow, the outside integral (from R to infinity):\n\nE_outside = Q/(4π ε₀ r²). So E² = Q²/(16 π² ε₀² r^4). The integral is (ε₀/2) * ∫ from R to ∞ of [Q²/(16 π² ε₀² r^4)] * 4π r² dr. Let's simplify:\n\n(ε₀/2) * (Q²/(16 π² ε₀²)) * 4π ∫ from R to ∞ of (r² / r^4) dr = (ε₀/2) * (4π Q²)/(16 π² ε₀²) ) * ∫ R to ∞ dr / r².\n\nSimplify coefficients: (4π)/(16 π²) = 1/(4 π), so (ε₀/2) * (1/(4 π ε₀²)) ) = 1/(8 π ε₀). Then, the integral of 1/r² from R to ∞ is [ -1/r ] from R to ∞ = 0 - (-1/R) = 1/R. So the outside integral becomes (1/(8 π ε₀)) * Q² * (1/R). So that's Q²/(8 π ε₀ R).\n\nAdding the two parts together: Q²/(40 π ε₀ R) + Q²/(8 π ε₀ R) = (1/40 + 5/40) Q²/(π ε₀ R) = (6/40) Q²/(π ε₀ R) = (3/20) Q²/(π ε₀ R). Wait, but wait, let me check the coefficients again. Wait, 1/40 + 1/8 = 1/40 + 5/40 = 6/40 = 3/20. So total U = (3/20) Q²/(π ε₀ R). Hmm, but I think the standard result is (3/5) (Q²)/(4π ε₀ R). Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the coefficients.\n\nWait, let's recheck the inside integral. Let's go back step by step.\n\nInside integral:\n\nE_inside = Q r / (4π ε₀ R³)\n\nE² = Q² r² / (16 π² ε₀² R^6)\n\nMultiply by ε₀/2 and dV = 4π r² dr:\n\nIntegral from 0 to R: (ε₀/2) * (Q² r²)/(16 π² ε₀² R^6) * 4π r² dr\n\n= (ε₀/2) * (4π Q² r^4)/(16 π² ε₀² R^6) dr\n\n= (4π Q² r^4)/(32 π² ε₀ R^6) dr\n\n= (Q² r^4)/(8 π ε₀ R^6) dr\n\nIntegrate from 0 to R: Q²/(8 π ε₀ R^6) * ∫0 to R r^4 dr\n\n= Q²/(8 π ε₀ R^6) * [R^5 /5]\n\n= Q² R^5 / (40 π ε₀ R^6)\n\n= Q²/(40 π ε₀ R)\n\nOkay, that's correct. Then the outside integral:\n\nE_outside = Q/(4π ε₀ r²)\n\nE² = Q²/(16 π² ε₀² r^4)\n\nMultiply by ε₀/2 and dV = 4π r² dr:\n\nIntegral from R to ∞: (ε₀/2) * (Q²)/(16 π² ε₀² r^4) * 4π r² dr\n\n= (ε₀/2) * (4π Q²)/(16 π² ε₀²) * ∫ dr / r²\n\n= (4π Q²)/(32 π² ε₀) * ∫ dr / r²\n\n= (Q²)/(8 π ε₀) * [ -1/r ] from R to ∞\n\n= (Q²)/(8 π ε₀) * (1/R)\n\nSo outside integral is Q²/(8 π ε₀ R)\n\nAdding inside and outside:\n\nQ²/(40 π ε₀ R) + Q²/(8 π ε₀ R) = (1 + 5)/40 Q²/(π ε₀ R) = 6/40 Q²/(π ε₀ R) = 3/20 Q²/(π ε₀ R)\n\nBut wait, the standard formula for the energy of a uniformly charged sphere is (3/5) (Q²)/(4π ε₀ R). Let's compute that: (3/5)/(4π ε₀ R) Q² = 3 Q²/(20 π ε₀ R). Which matches our result! Because 3/20 is the same as 3/(20). So yes, 3/(20 π ε₀ R) Q². So the final answer is (3 Q²)/(20 π ε₀ R). Alternatively, since 1/(4π ε₀) is k, the Coulomb constant, so we can write it as (3 k Q²)/(5 R). Because 3/(20 π ε₀ R) Q² = 3/(5) * (1/(4 π ε₀)) * Q²/R = (3/5) k Q²/R. Because k = 1/(4π ε₀). So yes, the standard formula is (3/5) k Q²/R. So the answer is (3/5) (Q²)/(4π ε₀ R) = 3 Q²/(20 π ε₀ R). So part (a) answer is U = (3 Q²)/(20 π ε₀ R) or equivalently (3/5)(k Q²)/R.\n\nNow part (b): Since ²⁷₁₄Si and ²⁷₁₃Al are mirror nuclei, their ground states are identical except for charge. The mass difference is 6 MeV, and we need to estimate their radius, neglecting the proton-neutron mass difference.\n\nMirror nuclei have the same mass number but differ by exchanging a proton and a neutron. For example, here, Si has 14 protons and 13 neutrons (since 27-14=13), and Al has 13 protons and 14 neutrons. The mass difference is due to the Coulomb energy difference because the number of protons differs by one. The idea is that the Coulomb repulsion in Si is higher than in Al because Si has one more proton. The mass difference comes from the difference in electrostatic energy between the two nuclei.\n\nThe mass difference Δm corresponds to the Coulomb energy difference. Since the mass difference is given as 6 MeV, which is the energy difference due to the Coulomb energy. So we can write ΔE = 6 MeV ≈ (3/5) (e²/(4π ε₀ R)) * (Z₁² - Z₂²)/A^(1/3) ? Wait, maybe not exactly. Wait, the Coulomb energy for a nucleus is approximated as (3/5) (Z² e²)/(4π ε₀ R), where R is the radius. For a nucleus, R = r₀ A^(1/3), where r₀ is about 1.2 fm.\n\nBut since these are mirror nuclei, their radii should be the same, so R = r₀ A^(1/3). The Coulomb energy difference between Si and Al would be the difference in their Coulomb energies. Si has Z=14, Al Z=13. So the Coulomb energy for Si is (3/5) (14² e²)/(4π ε₀ R), and for Al it's (3/5)(13² e²)/(4π ε₀ R). The difference ΔE = (3/5)(e²/(4π ε₀ R))(14² -13²) = (3/5)(e²/(4π ε₀ R))(196 -169) = (3/5)(27 e²)/(4π ε₀ R). This ΔE is given as 6 MeV. So we can solve for R.\n\nSo:\n\nΔE = (3/5)(27 e²)/(4π ε₀ R) = 6 MeV.\n\nWe need to compute R. Let's plug in the constants. Let's recall that e²/(4π ε₀) is approximately 1.44 MeV·fm. So e²/(4π ε₀) ≈ 1.44 MeV fm. Then:\n\nΔE = (3/5) * 27 * (1.44 MeV fm) / R = 6 MeV.\n\nCompute the left-hand side:\n\n(3/5)*27 = 81/5 = 16.2\n\nSo 16.2 * 1.44 MeV fm / R = 6 MeV\n\nMultiply 16.2 * 1.44:\n\n16 *1.44 = 23.04, 0.2*1.44=0.288 → total 23.04+0.288=23.328\n\nSo 23.328 MeV fm / R = 6 MeV\n\nSolve for R: R = 23.328 MeV fm /6 MeV = 3.888 fm ≈ 3.89 fm.\n\nBut wait, the radius R is given by r₀ A^(1/3). Here, A=27. So R = r₀ *27^(1/3). 27^(1/3)=3, so R=3 r₀. If we found R≈3.89 fm, then r₀ = R/3 ≈ 1.296 fm, which is close to the standard value of ~1.2 fm. But the question asks to estimate their radius. Wait, but in the problem, we are supposed to find R given that the mass difference is 6 MeV. So according to our calculation, R≈3.89 fm. But maybe there's a factor I missed. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the Coulomb energy for a nucleus is (3/5)(Z² e²)/(4π ε₀ R). The difference between Z=14 and Z=13 is:\n\nΔE = (3/5)(14² -13²)e²/(4π ε₀ R) = (3/5)(196-169)(e²/(4π ε₀ R)) = (3/5)(27)(e²/(4π ε₀ R)).\n\nYes, that's correct. Then substituting e²/(4π ε₀) = 1.44 MeV·fm:\n\nΔE = (3*27/5) * (1.44 MeV·fm)/R = (81/5)*1.44 / R = (16.2 *1.44)/R = 23.328 / R.\n\nSet equal to 6 MeV:\n\n23.328 / R =6 → R=23.328/6 ≈3.888 fm.\n\nSo the radius R is approximately 3.89 fm. Since the question says \"estimate their radius\", and given that typical r₀ is ~1.2 fm, and A=27, R=1.2*3=3.6 fm. Our calculation gives a bit larger, around 3.9 fm. But perhaps the approximation is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the formula uses a different coefficient. Let me check standard Coulomb energy formula.\n\nWait, sometimes the Coulomb energy is written as E_C = a_C * Z²/A^(1/3), where a_C is a constant. For example, in the semi-empirical mass formula, a_C is around 0.715 MeV. But in that case, the Coulomb term is (3/5)(e²/(4π ε₀ R)) Z², and since R = r₀ A^(1/3), then E_C = (3/5)(e²/(4π ε₀ r₀)) Z²/A^(1/3). So a_C = (3/5)(e²/(4π ε₀ r₀)). If we take r₀=1.2 fm, then a_C = (3/5)(1.44 MeV·fm)/(1.2 fm) )= (3/5)(1.2 MeV) = 0.72 MeV, which matches the semi-empirical value. But in our problem, we are not using the semi-empirical formula, but directly calculating the Coulomb energy difference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mass difference is given as 6 MeV, which is the difference in Coulomb energy. So our calculation leads to R≈3.89 fm, which would imply r₀≈1.296 fm. But the standard r₀ is around 1.2 fm. However, the problem says to estimate the radius, so perhaps the answer is approximately 4 fm. But let's check the calculation again for possible errors.\n\nWait, another approach: the Coulomb energy difference is ΔE = (3/5)(e²/(4π ε₀ R))(Z1² - Z2²). Here Z1=14, Z2=13. So ΔE = (3/5)(1.44 MeV fm/R)(14² -13²) = (3/5)(1.44)(27)/R. So 3*1.44*27/(5 R) = (116.64)/(5 R) = 23.328/R. Set to 6 MeV: 23.328/R =6 → R=23.328/6≈3.888 fm. So yes, same result. So the radius R is approximately 3.89 fm. The problem says \"estimate\", so rounding to about 4 fm. But maybe more precisely 3.9 fm. Alternatively, using e²/(4π ε₀) =1.44 MeV fm, and the calculation gives R≈3.888 fm. So the answer is approximately 3.9 fm. But let me check if there's a factor I missed. For example, sometimes the Coulomb energy is calculated with the charge radius, considering protons are distributed in the nucleus. But since the problem states that the nuclei are mirror nuclei, their radii are the same, so the approach should be correct. Therefore, the estimated radius is approximately 3.9 fm.\n</think>\n\n(a) The electrostatic energy of a charge \\( Q \\) uniformly distributed within a sphere of radius \\( R \\) is calculated by integrating the electric field's energy density.

{"id": "atomic/2-26", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to explain why the binding energy per nucleon is highest around iron-56 and much less for uranium-238 using the semiempirical nuclear binding theory. Hmm, first, I should recall the semiempirical binding energy formula. Let me think... The formula, also known as the Bethe-Weizsäcker formula, accounts for different contributions to the binding energy.\n\nRight, the formula has several terms: volume term, surface term, Coulomb term, asymmetry term, and pairing term. Each term contributes either positively or negatively to the binding energy. The total binding energy is the sum of these terms. The volume term is positive and proportional to the number of nucleons, A. The surface term is negative and proportional to A^(2/3), because nucleons on the surface have fewer neighbors. The Coulomb term is negative and comes from the electrostatic repulsion between protons, so it's proportional to Z²/A^(1/3). The asymmetry term accounts for the energy cost of having an imbalance in the number of protons and neutrons, so it's proportional to (N-Z)²/A. The pairing term is a correction for even or odd numbers of protons and neutrons, but maybe I don't need the exact coefficients here.\n\nSo, the formula is something like B = a_V*A - a_S*A^(2/3) - a_C*Z²/A^(1/3) - a_A*(N-Z)²/A + delta(A,Z), where delta is the pairing term. The exact coefficients (a_V, a_S, etc.) are empirical constants, but the question says I don't need to specify their values.\n\nNow, why does the binding energy per nucleon (B/A) peak around Fe-56? Let's think about each term's contribution as A increases. For light nuclei, the surface term and Coulomb term are small. As A increases, the volume term dominates, so B/A increases. But as the nucleus gets larger, the surface term (which is negative) becomes more significant. Also, the Coulomb term, which is proportional to Z²/A^(1/3), increases because Z increases with A. The Coulomb term reduces the binding energy. For heavy nuclei like U-238, the Coulomb repulsion between protons becomes a major factor, lowering the binding energy per nucleon.\n\nThe asymmetry term also plays a role. For heavier nuclei, to maintain stability, more neutrons are needed (N > Z) to counteract the Coulomb repulsion. This increases the (N-Z)² term, which further reduces the binding energy. So, as A increases beyond a certain point (around iron), the negative contributions from Coulomb and asymmetry terms outweigh the positive volume term, causing B/A to decrease.\n\nIron-56 is near the peak because it's where the balance between the volume term (which favors larger A) and the Coulomb and surface terms (which disfavor larger A) is optimal. Beyond iron, adding more nucleons leads to a larger Coulomb repulsion and increased surface area, making the nucleus less tightly bound per nucleon. Uranium-238, being much heavier, has a lower B/A because the Coulomb term is significantly larger, and the asymmetry term is also more negative.\n\nSo, in summary, the semiempirical formula explains the peak at Fe-56 due to the competition between the volume term (favoring binding) and the surface, Coulomb, and asymmetry terms (reducing binding). For heavier nuclei like U-238, the Coulomb term's negative contribution becomes dominant, leading to lower binding energy per nucleon.\n</think>\n\nThe semiempirical nuclear binding energy formula (Bethe-Weizsäcker formula) is given by:\n\n\\[\nB = a_V A - a_S A^{2/3} - a_C \\frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}} - a_A \\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A} + \\delta(A,Z),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(a_V\\), \\(a_S\\), \\(a_C\\), and \\(a_A\\) are coefficients for the volume, surface, Coulomb, and asymmetry terms, respectively, and \\(\\delta(A,Z)\\) is the pairing term. The binding energy per nucleon (\\(B/A\\)) peaks near \\(^{56}\\text{Fe}\\) due to the interplay of these terms:\n\n1. **Volume term (\\(a_V A\\))**: Favors larger \\(A\\) but contributes uniformly per nucleon.\n2. **Surface term (\\(-a_S A^{2/3}\\))**: Reduces binding energy for larger nuclei due to fewer nucleon interactions at the surface.\n3. **Coulomb term (\\(-a_C Z^2/A^{1/3}\\))**: Dominates for heavy nuclei, as proton repulsion grows with \\(Z^2\\), reducing \\(B/A\\).\n4. **Asymmetry term (\\(-a_A (N-Z)^2/A\\))**: Penalizes neutron-proton imbalance, significant in heavy nuclei with \\(N \\gg Z\\).\n\nFor \\(^{56}\\text{Fe}\\), the balance between the volume term and the diminishing returns from surface, Coulomb, and asymmetry terms is optimal.

{"id": "atomic/2-19", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve part (a) of this physics problem. Let me start by recalling what I know about scattering theory and phase shifts. The problem involves calculating the differential cross section dσ/dΩ for elastic scattering of a neutron by a nucleus at a center-of-mass energy of 5 MeV. The given phase shifts are δ₀ = 30° and δ₁ = 10°, with all other phase shifts negligible. I need to plot dσ/dΩ as a function of scattering angle and compute specific values at 30°, 45°, and 90°, as well as find the total cross section σ.\n\nFirst, I remember that the differential cross section for elastic scattering in partial wave analysis is given by the formula:\n\ndσ/dΩ = |f(θ)|²\n\nwhere f(θ) is the scattering amplitude, which is expressed in terms of phase shifts δ_l:\n\nf(θ) = (1/k) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ)\n\nHere, k is the wave number, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. Since the problem states that all phase shifts beyond l=1 are negligible, the sum will only include l=0 and l=1 terms. So, the scattering amplitude simplifies to:\n\nf(θ) = (1/k) [ (2*0 + 1)e^{iδ₀} sinδ₀ P₀(cosθ) + (2*1 + 1)e^{iδ₁} sinδ₁ P₁(cosθ) ]\n\nSimplifying the coefficients:\n\nFor l=0: coefficient is 1 (since 2*0 +1 =1), so term is e^{iδ₀} sinδ₀ P₀(cosθ)\nFor l=1: coefficient is 3 (since 2*1 +1=3), so term is 3 e^{iδ₁} sinδ₁ P₁(cosθ)\n\nBut since we have to multiply each term by (2l +1), so that's correct.\n\nNow, the Legendre polynomials for l=0 and l=1 are:\n\nP₀(x) = 1\nP₁(x) = x\n\nSo, substituting cosθ for x, P₀(cosθ) = 1, and P₁(cosθ) = cosθ.\n\nTherefore, the scattering amplitude becomes:\n\nf(θ) = (1/k) [ e^{iδ₀} sinδ₀ * 1 + 3 e^{iδ₁} sinδ₁ * cosθ ]\n\nBut since we have to compute |f(θ)|², which is the modulus squared of this complex amplitude. Let's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's write f(θ) as:\n\nf(θ) = (1/k) [ A + B cosθ ]\n\nwhere A = e^{iδ₀} sinδ₀ and B = 3 e^{iδ₁} sinδ₁.\n\nTo compute |f(θ)|², we need to compute |A + B cosθ|² divided by k².\n\nThe modulus squared of a sum is |A + B cosθ|² = |A|² + |B|² cos²θ + 2 Re(A B* cosθ)\n\nBut since A and B are complex numbers, their product will involve cross terms.\n\nAlternatively, since A and B have phases δ₀ and δ₁ respectively, we can write:\n\nA = sinδ₀ e^{iδ₀}\nB = 3 sinδ₁ e^{iδ₁}\n\nTherefore, A + B cosθ = sinδ₀ e^{iδ₀} + 3 sinδ₁ e^{iδ₁} cosθ\n\nSo, the modulus squared is:\n\n|A + B cosθ|² = [ sinδ₀ e^{iδ₀} + 3 sinδ₁ e^{iδ₁} cosθ ] [ sinδ₀ e^{-iδ₀} + 3 sinδ₁ e^{-iδ₁} cosθ ]\n\nMultiplying these out:\n\n= sin²δ₀ + 3 sinδ₀ sinδ₁ e^{i(δ₀ - δ₁)} cosθ + 3 sinδ₀ sinδ₁ e^{-i(δ₀ - δ₁)} cosθ + 9 sin²δ₁ cos²θ\n\nSimplify the cross terms:\n\nThe middle terms can be combined as 3 sinδ₀ sinδ₁ [ e^{i(δ₀ - δ₁)} + e^{-i(δ₀ - δ₁)} ] cosθ\n\nWhich is 6 sinδ₀ sinδ₁ cos(δ₀ - δ₁) cosθ\n\nTherefore, the modulus squared becomes:\n\n|A + B cosθ|² = sin²δ₀ + 6 sinδ₀ sinδ₁ cos(δ₀ - δ₁) cosθ + 9 sin²δ₁ cos²θ\n\nTherefore, the differential cross section is:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (1/k²) [ sin²δ₀ + 6 sinδ₀ sinδ₁ cos(δ₀ - δ₁) cosθ + 9 sin²δ₁ cos²θ ]\n\nNow, substituting the given phase shifts δ₀ = 30°, δ₁ = 10°, so δ₀ - δ₁ = 20°, and compute each term.\n\nFirst, compute sinδ₀ and sinδ₁:\n\nsin(30°) = 0.5\nsin(10°) ≈ 0.1736\n\nSo:\n\nsin²δ₀ = (0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\nsinδ₀ sinδ₁ = 0.5 * 0.1736 ≈ 0.0868\n\ncos(δ₀ - δ₁) = cos(20°) ≈ 0.9397\n\nThen, the cross term coefficient:\n\n6 * 0.0868 * 0.9397 ≈ 6 * 0.0816 ≈ 0.4896\n\nThe term with cosθ is 0.4896 cosθ\n\nThe last term is 9 sin²δ₁ cos²θ:\n\n9 * (0.1736)^2 ≈ 9 * 0.0301 ≈ 0.2709\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\ndσ/dΩ ≈ (1/k²) [ 0.25 + 0.4896 cosθ + 0.2709 cos²θ ]\n\nNow, we need to compute k. The wave number k is related to the center-of-mass energy. The energy given is 5 MeV. Since the neutron is much lighter than the nucleus, the reduced mass μ is approximately the neutron mass. The neutron mass is about 939 MeV/c². The wave number k is given by:\n\nk = √(2μE) / ħc\n\nBut in natural units where ħ = c = 1, k = √(2μE). However, to compute k in inverse femtometers (fm⁻¹) or similar, we need to use appropriate constants.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem doesn't specify units for the cross section, perhaps we can express the cross section in terms of 1/k². However, the problem might expect us to compute the numerical value of k to get the cross section in actual units. Let me check.\n\nWait, the problem says \"plot dσ/dΩ as a function of scattering angle\" and calculate it at specific angles. The total cross section is also required. However, without knowing the value of k, we can't compute the absolute values. Wait, but maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of 1/k², but perhaps the actual numerical value of k can be calculated from the given energy.\n\nSo, let's compute k. The neutron's kinetic energy is given as 5 MeV in the center-of-mass frame. The relation between energy and wave number is:\n\nE = (ħ²k²)/(2m)\n\nSolving for k:\n\nk = √(2mE)/ħ\n\nBut in units where ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, and m is the neutron mass, which is about 939.565 MeV/c².\n\nSo, let's compute k:\n\nFirst, compute 2mE: 2 * 939.565 MeV/c² * 5 MeV = 9395.65 (MeV)²/c²\n\nThen, divide by (ħc)² to get k²:\n\nk² = (2mE)/(ħ²c²) = (9395.65 (MeV)^2/c²) / ( (197.33 MeV·fm)^2 )\n\nCalculating denominator: (197.33)^2 ≈ 38944 (MeV²·fm²)\n\nSo, k² = 9395.65 / 38944 ≈ 0.2413 (MeV²/c²) / (MeV²·fm²) ) = 0.2413 / (c² fm²)\n\nBut since c² is (fm/seconds)^2, but units here might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps better to compute k in fm⁻¹.\n\nWait, let's recall that ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. So, rearranging E = (ħ²k²)/(2m):\n\nk = √(2mE)/ħ = √(2 * m * E) / (ħc) * c\n\nBut since we can write:\n\nk² = (2mE)/(ħ²c²) => k = √(2mE)/(ħc)\n\nSo, plugging numbers:\n\nm = 939.565 MeV/c²\n\nE = 5 MeV\n\nSo,\n\nk = √(2 * 939.565 * 5) / (197.33) [MeV]^(1/2) / (MeV·fm) ) ?\n\nWait, let's compute the numerator:\n\n√(2 * 939.565 * 5) = √(9395.65) ≈ 96.93 MeV\n\nThen, divide by ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm:\n\nk ≈ 96.93 / 197.33 ≈ 0.4913 fm⁻¹\n\nTherefore, k ≈ 0.4913 fm⁻¹, so k² ≈ (0.4913)^2 ≈ 0.2414 fm⁻²\n\nTherefore, 1/k² ≈ 4.142 fm²\n\nSo, the differential cross section is:\n\ndσ/dΩ ≈ (4.142 fm²) [0.25 + 0.4896 cosθ + 0.2709 cos²θ ]\n\nTherefore, simplifying:\n\ndσ/dΩ ≈ 4.142 * [0.25 + 0.4896 cosθ + 0.2709 cos²θ ] fm²/sr\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n0.25 * 4.142 ≈ 1.0355\n\n0.4896 * 4.142 ≈ 2.028\n\n0.2709 * 4.142 ≈ 1.122\n\nSo,\n\ndσ/dΩ ≈ [1.0355 + 2.028 cosθ + 1.122 cos²θ] fm²/sr\n\nTherefore, the differential cross section as a function of θ is:\n\ndσ/dΩ = 1.0355 + 2.028 cosθ + 1.122 cos²θ (in fm²/sr)\n\nBut we can also write this in terms of barns per steradian (1 barn = 100 fm²). So, 1 fm² = 0.01 barn. Therefore, converting:\n\n1.0355 fm²/sr = 0.010355 barns/sr\n\n2.028 fm²/sr = 0.02028 barns/sr\n\n1.122 fm²/sr = 0.01122 barns/sr\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify units, so perhaps we can leave it in fm²/sr. However, cross sections for nuclei are typically on the order of barns (10^-24 cm²), which is 100 fm². So, 1 fm² is 0.01 barns. But maybe the answer is expected in terms of 1/k² multiplied by the coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of 1/k², but given that we computed k, we can proceed numerically.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require plugging in the numerical value of k, but just leaving the answer in terms of 1/k². Wait, but part (a) asks to explicitly calculate dσ/dΩ at specific angles. So, we need numerical values, which requires knowing k. So, the previous calculation is necessary.\n\nWait, but let me check if the center-of-mass energy is 5 MeV. The neutron's kinetic energy in the lab frame vs. the center-of-mass frame. However, since the target is a nucleus, which is much heavier, the center-of-mass energy is approximately the same as the lab frame energy. Because the nucleus is heavy, the reduced mass is approximately the neutron mass. Therefore, the calculation of k using the neutron mass is correct.\n\nTherefore, proceeding with k ≈ 0.4913 fm⁻¹, so 1/k² ≈ 4.142 fm².\n\nTherefore, the differential cross section is as above.\n\nNow, compute dσ/dΩ at θ = 30°, 45°, and 90°.\n\nFirst, θ = 30°:\n\ncos30° ≈ √3/2 ≈ 0.8660\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1.0355 + 2.028 * 0.8660 + 1.122 * (0.8660)^2\n\nFirst term: 1.0355\n\nSecond term: 2.028 * 0.8660 ≈ 2.028 * 0.866 ≈ 1.756\n\nThird term: 1.122 * (0.750) ≈ 1.122 * 0.75 ≈ 0.8415\n\nSum: 1.0355 + 1.756 + 0.8415 ≈ 3.633 fm²/sr ≈ 0.03633 barns/sr\n\nSimilarly, θ = 45°:\n\ncos45° ≈ √2/2 ≈ 0.7071\n\nCompute terms:\n\n1.0355 + 2.028 * 0.7071 + 1.122 * (0.7071)^2\n\nSecond term: 2.028 * 0.7071 ≈ 1.434\n\nThird term: 1.122 * 0.5 ≈ 0.561\n\nSum: 1.0355 + 1.434 + 0.561 ≈ 3.0305 fm²/sr ≈ 0.0303 barns/sr\n\nθ = 90°:\n\ncos90° = 0\n\nSo terms:\n\n1.0355 + 0 + 0 = 1.0355 fm²/sr ≈ 0.010355 barns/sr\n\nTherefore, the differential cross sections at these angles are approximately 3.63 fm²/sr at 30°, 3.03 fm²/sr at 45°, and 1.04 fm²/sr at 90°.\n\nNow, the total cross section σ is given by the integral of dσ/dΩ over all solid angles:\n\nσ = ∫ (dσ/dΩ) dΩ\n\nSince the differential cross section depends only on θ (not φ), the integral simplifies to:\n\nσ = 2π ∫₀^π (dσ/dΩ) sinθ dθ\n\nSubstituting the expression for dσ/dΩ:\n\nσ = 2π (1/k²) ∫₀^π [ sin²δ₀ + 6 sinδ₀ sinδ₁ cos(δ₀ - δ₁) cosθ + 9 sin²δ₁ cos²θ ] sinθ dθ\n\nBut integrating term by term:\n\nFirst term: sin²δ₀ ∫ sinθ dθ from 0 to π = sin²δ₀ [ -cosθ ]₀^π = sin²δ₀ ( -(-1) - (-1) ) = sin²δ₀ (2)\n\nSecond term: 6 sinδ₀ sinδ₁ cos(δ₀ - δ₁) ∫ cosθ sinθ dθ from 0 to π\n\nLet u = cosθ, du = -sinθ dθ, so integral becomes ∫ u (-du) from 1 to -1 = ∫ u du from -1 to 1 = [ (1/2)u² ] from -1 to 1 = (1/2)(1 - 1) = 0\n\nThird term: 9 sin²δ₁ ∫ cos²θ sinθ dθ from 0 to π\n\nLet u = cosθ, du = -sinθ dθ, integral becomes ∫ u² (-du) from 1 to -1 = ∫ u² du from -1 to 1 = [ (1/3)u³ ] from -1 to 1 = (1/3)(1 - (-1)) = 2/3\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nσ = 2π (1/k²) [ 2 sin²δ₀ + 0 + 9 sin²δ₁ * (2/3) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 2π (1/k²) [ 2 sin²δ₀ + 6 sin²δ₁ ]\n\n= (4π/k²) sin²δ₀ + (12π/k²) sin²δ₁\n\nBut substituting the values:\n\nsin²δ₀ = 0.25, sin²δ₁ ≈ (0.1736)^2 ≈ 0.0301\n\nSo:\n\nσ ≈ (4π /k²)(0.25) + (12π /k²)(0.0301)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 4π * 0.25 /k² = π /k² ≈ 3.1416 /0.2414 ≈ 13.01 fm²\n\nSecond term: 12π * 0.0301 /k² ≈ 12 * 3.1416 * 0.0301 /0.2414 ≈ (1.134) /0.2414 ≈ 4.70 fm²\n\nTotal σ ≈ 13.01 + 4.70 ≈ 17.71 fm² ≈ 0.177 barns\n\nBut let's check the calculation again:\n\nWait, 1/k² ≈ 4.142 fm²\n\nSo:\n\nFirst term: (4π/k²) sin²δ₀ = 4π * 0.25 * 4.142 ≈ π * 4.142 ≈ 3.1416 *4.142 ≈ 13.01 fm²\n\nSecond term: (12π/k²) sin²δ₁ = 12π * 0.0301 *4.142 ≈ 12 *3.1416 *0.0301 *4.142\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n12 * 0.0301 = 0.3612\n\n0.3612 * 4.142 ≈ 1.497\n\n1.497 * π ≈ 4.70\n\nSo total σ ≈ 13.01 +4.70 ≈17.71 fm², which is 0.177 barns.\n\nBut cross sections for neutron-nucleus scattering are typically on the order of barns, so 0.177 barns seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in units. Wait, 1 barn is 10^-24 cm², and 1 fm² is 10^-30 m² = 10^-26 cm², so 1 fm² = 0.01 barn. Therefore, 17.71 fm² = 0.1771 barns, which is 0.177 barns. That seems plausible.\n\nTherefore, the total cross section σ is approximately 0.177 barns.\n\nBut let me verify the integral again. The total cross section in partial wave analysis is given by:\n\nσ = (4π/k²) Σ_{l=0}^\\infty (2l +1) sin²δ_l\n\nSince only l=0 and l=1 contribute:\n\nσ = (4π/k²)[ (1) sin²δ₀ + (3) sin²δ₁ ]\n\nWhich is exactly what we derived earlier. Therefore, substituting:\n\nσ = (4π/k²)( sin²30° + 3 sin²10° )\n\nCompute sin²30° = 0.25, sin²10° ≈ 0.0301, so:\n\nσ = (4π/k²)(0.25 + 0.0903) = (4π/k²)(0.3403)\n\nThen, 4π/k² ≈ 4 *3.1416 /0.2414 ≈ 12.566 /0.2414 ≈ 52.07 fm²\n\nMultiply by 0.3403: 52.07 *0.3403 ≈17.71 fm², which matches the previous result.\n\nTherefore, the total cross section is approximately 17.7 fm² or 0.177 barns.\n\nNow, summarizing part (a):\n\nThe differential cross section as a function of θ is:\n\ndσ/dΩ ≈ 1.0355 + 2.028 cosθ + 1.122 cos²θ fm²/sr\n\nAt θ = 30°: ~3.63 fm²/sr\n\nAt θ = 45°: ~3.03 fm²/sr\n\nAt θ = 90°: ~1.04 fm²/sr\n\nTotal cross section σ ≈17.7 fm² ≈0.177 barns\n\nFor part (b), the question is about the implication of the higher phase shifts (δ₂, δ₃, ...) being negligible. The idea is that the phase shifts are related to the angular momentum l, which is connected to the impact parameter b via l ≈ kb, where k is the wave number. If higher l phase shifts are negligible, it suggests that the potential has a finite range R beyond which the potential is negligible. The maximum angular momentum that interacts with the potential is l_max ≈ kR. If phase shifts beyond l=1 are zero, then l_max ≈1, so R ≈ l_max /k ≈1/k.\n\nGiven that k ≈0.4913 fm⁻¹, so R ≈1/0.4913 ≈2.04 fm. Therefore, the range of the potential is approximately 2 fm.\n\nBut let me elaborate. The maximum angular momentum for which the phase shift is non-zero is related to the range of the potential. The impact parameter b is related to angular momentum via l = k b. If the potential has a range R, then particles with impact parameters greater than R won't interact, so the maximum l contributing is l_max ≈kR. If all phase shifts beyond l=1 are negligible, then l_max=1, so kR ≈1, hence R≈1/k. Since we found k≈0.4913 fm⁻¹, R≈2.04 fm. Therefore, the range of the potential is approximately 2 fm.\n\nTherefore, part (b) answer: The range of the potential R is approximately 1/k, which with k ≈0.49 fm⁻¹ gives R≈2 fm. Hence, the potential has a short range of about 2 femtometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n(a) The differential cross sections are:\n\nAt $30^\\circ$: $\\boxed{3.63\\ \\text{fm}^2/\\text{sr}}$  \nAt

{"id": "atomic/1-37", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the Lamb shifts for the 1s and 2p levels of the hydrogen atom due to the perturbation term involving r_0 squared times the Laplacian of the Coulomb potential. Let me start by recalling the given potential energy expression:\n\nU(r) = V(r) + (r_0²/6)∇²V(r) + ...\n\nThe Lamb shift comes from the second term here, which is treated as a small perturbation. The main term is the Coulomb potential V(r) = -e²/r. So the perturbation Hamiltonian is (r_0²/6)∇²V(r). \n\nFirst, I need to compute the Laplacian of V(r). Let's calculate ∇²V(r). Since V(r) = -e²/r, which is a function of r only, the Laplacian in spherical coordinates for a radial function is:\n\n∇²V(r) = (1/r²) d/dr [r² dV/dr] \n\nLet me compute that. The first derivative dV/dr is d/dr (-e²/r) = e²/r². Then, multiply by r²: r² * e²/r² = e². Then take the derivative with respect to r: d/dr (e²) = 0. So ∇²V(r) = (1/r²)(0) = 0. Wait, that can't be right. Because the Laplacian of 1/r is -4πδ³(r) in three dimensions. Hmm, maybe I need to be careful here. \n\nWait, the Coulomb potential V(r) = -e²/r. The Laplacian of 1/r is indeed -4πδ³(r). So ∇²(1/r) = -4πδ³(r). Therefore, ∇²V(r) = -e² ∇²(1/r) = 4π e² δ³(r). \n\nOh, right! Because the Laplacian of 1/r is a delta function. So that's important. So the perturbation term is (r_0²/6) * 4π e² δ³(r). So the perturbation Hamiltonian H' is (r_0²/6)(4π e²) δ³(r) = (2π e² r_0² / 3) δ³(r). \n\nTherefore, the first-order energy shift due to this perturbation is the expectation value of H' in the given state. So for a state |ψ>, the energy shift ΔE is <ψ| H' |ψ> = (2π e² r_0² / 3) <ψ| δ³(r) |ψ>.\n\nBut the delta function δ³(r) picks out the value of the wavefunction at r=0. So <ψ| δ³(r) |ψ> = |ψ(0)|². \n\nNow, let's look at the wavefunctions for 1s and 2p states. \n\nThe 1s wavefunction is given as ψ_{1s}(r) = 2 a_B^{-3/2} exp(-r/a_B) Y_0^0. The spherical harmonic Y_0^0 is 1/sqrt(4π). So ψ_{1s}(0) would be 2 a_B^{-3/2} * exp(0) * (1/sqrt(4π)) ) = 2 a_B^{-3/2} / sqrt(4π) = (2 / sqrt(4π)) a_B^{-3/2} = (1 / sqrt(π)) a_B^{-3/2}. \n\nTherefore, |ψ_{1s}(0)|² = (1 / π) a_B^{-3}. \n\nSo the energy shift for 1s is (2π e² r_0² / 3) * (1 / π) a_B^{-3} ) = (2 e² r_0² / 3) a_B^{-3}. \n\nBut wait, let me check the constants again. The perturbation is (r_0²/6) ∇² V(r). Since ∇² V(r) = 4π e² δ³(r), then H' = (r_0²/6)(4π e²) δ³(r) = (4π e² r_0² / 6) δ³(r) = (2π e² r_0² / 3) δ³(r). \n\nThen the expectation value is (2π e² r_0² / 3) |ψ(0)|². \n\nFor the 1s state, |ψ(0)|² is (1/π a_B^3). So multiplying gives (2π e² r_0² / 3) * (1 / π a_B^3) ) = (2 e² r_0² / 3 a_B^3). \n\nNow, for the 2p state. The wavefunction is ψ_{2pm}(r) = a_B^{-5/2} r exp(-r/(2a_B)) Y_1^m / sqrt(24). \n\nBut Y_1^m are the spherical harmonics with l=1. The important thing here is that for p-orbitals (l=1), the wavefunction at r=0 is zero. Because the radial part for 2p is proportional to r, so when r=0, the wavefunction is zero. Therefore, ψ_{2pm}(0) = 0. \n\nTherefore, |ψ_{2pm}(0)|² = 0, so the expectation value of δ³(r) is zero. Therefore, the energy shift for 2p states is zero. \n\nSo the Lamb shift for 1s is (2 e² r_0²)/(3 a_B^3), and for 2p it's zero. \n\nBut let me check if I made any mistakes here. Let's verify the calculation of the Laplacian again. The Coulomb potential V(r) = -e²/r. Then ∇² V(r) = -e² ∇² (1/r) = -e² (-4π δ³(r)) ) = 4π e² δ³(r). That's correct. \n\nThen the perturbation is (r_0²/6) times that, so (r_0²/6)(4π e² δ³(r)) = (2π e² r_0² / 3) δ³(r). \n\nThen the expectation value is (2π e² r_0² / 3) |ψ(0)|². \n\nFor 1s, the wavefunction at r=0 is non-zero. For 2p, since the radial part is proportional to r, it's zero at r=0. Therefore, the energy shift for 2p is zero. \n\nSo the Lamb shift for 1s is (2 e² r_0²)/(3 a_B^3). Let me express this in terms of fundamental constants. Since a_B = ħ²/(m_e e²), so a_B^3 = ħ^6/(m_e^3 e^6). Therefore, 1/a_B^3 = m_e^3 e^6 / ħ^6. \n\nSubstituting back into the energy shift: (2 e² r_0² / 3) * (m_e^3 e^6 / ħ^6) ) = (2 m_e^3 e^8 r_0²) / (3 ħ^6). \n\nBut maybe the problem wants the answer expressed in terms of a_B, so perhaps we can leave it as (2 e² r_0²)/(3 a_B^3). \n\nAlternatively, using a_B = ħ²/(m_e e²), so e² = ħ²/(m_e a_B). Therefore, substituting e² into the expression:\n\n(2 * (ħ²/(m_e a_B)) * r_0² ) / (3 a_B^3) ) = (2 ħ² r_0²) / (3 m_e a_B^4). \n\nBut the problem says to express the result in terms of r_0 and fundamental constants. The fundamental constants here would be e, m_e, ħ, etc. However, since a_B is given as ħ²/(m_e e²), which is a combination of fundamental constants, but maybe the answer is better left in terms of a_B. Let me check the question again. \n\nThe question says: \"Express your result in terms of r_0 and fundamental constants.\" Since a_B is defined as ħ²/(m_e e^2), which is a combination of fundamental constants, so perhaps we can write the answer in terms of a_B. \n\nSo the 1s Lamb shift is (2 e² r_0²)/(3 a_B^3). Alternatively, substituting e² = ħ²/(m_e a_B), then:\n\n(2 * (ħ²/(m_e a_B)) * r_0² ) / (3 a_B^3) ) = (2 ħ² r_0²)/(3 m_e a_B^4). \n\nBut both forms are correct. However, since the problem gives the wavefunctions in terms of a_B, maybe the answer should be expressed using a_B. Let me check the original question's given wavefunctions. \n\nYes, the wavefunctions are given with a_B, so the answer is probably expected in terms of a_B. Therefore, the Lamb shift for 1s is (2 e² r_0²)/(3 a_B^3), and for 2p it's zero. \n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\nFor 1s: ΔE_{1s} = (2 e² r_0²)/(3 a_B³)\n\nFor 2p: ΔE_{2p} = 0\n\nSo boxed answers would be:\n\n1s: \\boxed{\\dfrac{2 e^2 r_0^2}{3 a_B^3}}\n\n2p: \\boxed{0}\n</think>\n\nThe Lamb shift arises from the perturbation term \\(\\frac{r_0^2}{6} \\nabla^2 V(r)\\) in the potential energy. For the Coulomb potential \\(V(r) = -e^2/r\\), the Laplacian \\(\\nabla^2 V(r)\\) is \\(4\\pi e^2 \\delta^3(\\mathbf{r})\\). The perturbation Hamiltonian is thus \\(\\frac{2\\pi e^2 r_0^2}{3} \\delta^3(\\mathbf{r})\\).\n\nThe energy shift is the expectation value of this perturbation. For a wavefunction \\(\\psi\\), this is \\(\\frac{2\\pi e^2 r_0^2}{3} |\\psi(0)|^2\\).\n\n- **1s state**: The wavefunction \\(\\psi_{1s}(0)\\) is non-zero.

{"id": "atomic/2-7", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the minimum energy a proton needs to penetrate the Coulomb barrier of a light nucleus. The options are 1 GeV, 1 MeV, or 1 KeV. Let me start by recalling what the Coulomb barrier is.\n\nThe Coulomb barrier is the electrostatic potential energy that must be overcome for two charged particles, like a proton and a nucleus, to get close enough for the nuclear force to act. Since both are positively charged, they repel each other. The proton needs enough kinetic energy to overcome this repulsion.\n\nThe potential energy at the barrier can be estimated using the formula for electric potential energy between two charges: U = (k * Z1 * Z2 * e²) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, Z1 and Z2 are the atomic numbers of the two particles, e is the elementary charge, and r is the distance between them when they come into contact.\n\nFor a light nucleus, let's say something like carbon or oxygen. The atomic number Z for a light nucleus might be around, say, 6 to 8. The proton has Z=1. The radius r of the nucleus can be approximated by the formula r = r0 * A^(1/3), where r0 is about 1.2 fm (femtometers) and A is the mass number. For a light nucleus, A might be around 12 (carbon), so r would be 1.2 * 12^(1/3). 12^(1/3) is approximately 2.29, so r ≈ 1.2 * 2.29 ≈ 2.75 fm. But wait, when the proton is approaching the nucleus, the distance r would be the sum of the radii of the proton and the nucleus. The proton's radius is about 0.8 fm, so total r ≈ 2.75 + 0.8 ≈ 3.55 fm. Let me convert that to meters: 3.55e-15 m.\n\nPlugging into the formula: U = (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) * (1) * (6) * (1.602e-19 C)² / (3.55e-15 m). Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator: 8.988e9 * 1 * 6 * (1.602e-19)^2. Let's compute (1.602e-19)^2 first: that's approximately 2.566e-38 C². Multiply by 6: 1.5396e-37. Multiply by 8.988e9: 1.5396e-37 * 8.988e9 ≈ 1.383e-27 N·m²/C² * C² = 1.383e-27 N·m². Then divide by 3.55e-15 m: 1.383e-27 / 3.55e-15 ≈ 3.896e-13 N·m, which is Joules.\n\nSo U ≈ 3.896e-13 J. Convert that to electron volts. Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so divide by 1.602e-19: 3.896e-13 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.43e6 eV, which is 2.43 MeV. Hmm, but the options are 1 GeV, 1 MeV, or 1 KeV. Wait, but this is the potential energy. However, in reality, due to the tunnel effect, the required energy can be lower than the barrier height. But the question says \"minimum energy of the order of\", so approximate magnitude.\n\nBut wait, my calculation gave around 2.4 MeV for a nucleus with Z=6. If the nucleus is lighter, say Z=4 (beryllium), then the energy would be lower. Let's check that. For Z=4, the calculation would be 8.988e9 *1*4*(1.602e-19)^2 / (r). Let's recalculate with Z=4 and maybe a smaller radius. Let's take A=9 (beryllium-9), so r = 1.2 * 9^(1/3) ≈ 1.2 * 2.08 ≈ 2.5 fm. Adding proton radius: 2.5 + 0.8 = 3.3 fm. Then U = (8.988e9 *4 * (1.602e-19)^2) / (3.3e-15). Compute numerator: 8.988e9 *4 = 3.595e10. Multiply by (1.602e-19)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38: 3.595e10 * 2.566e-38 ≈ 9.23e-28. Divide by 3.3e-15: 9.23e-28 / 3.3e-15 ≈ 2.8e-13 J. Convert to eV: 2.8e-13 /1.602e-19 ≈ 1.75e6 eV = 1.75 MeV. So even for Z=4, it's around 1.75 MeV. So the order of magnitude is MeV. Therefore, the answer should be (b) 1 MeV.\n\nBut wait, the actual Coulomb barrier for light nuclei is typically around a few MeV. For example, in fusion reactions in stars, protons need to overcome the Coulomb barrier of hydrogen nuclei (protons), but even there, the required temperatures correspond to keV energies, but quantum tunneling allows it at lower energies. However, the question is about the minimum energy required, which would be on the order of the barrier height. But in reality, because of tunneling, particles can penetrate the barrier at energies lower than the barrier. However, the question is phrased as \"must have a minimum energy of the order of\", which might refer to the typical height of the Coulomb barrier, not the actual energy needed considering tunneling. So the answer would be MeV. So option (b) 1 MeV.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the minimum energy a proton needs to penetrate the Coulomb barrier of a light nucleus, we calculate the electrostatic potential energy using the formula:  \n\\[\nU = \\frac{k Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{r},\n\\]  \nwhere \\(k = 8.988 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{N·m}^2/\\text{C}^2\\), \\(Z_1 = 1\\) (proton), \\(Z_2 \\approx 6\\) (light nucleus like carbon), \\(e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C}\\), and \\(r \\approx 3.55 \\, \\text{fm} = 3.55 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}\\).  \n\nSubstituting values:  \n\\[\nU = \\frac{(8.988 \\times 10^9)(1)(6)(1.602 \\times 10^{-19})^2}{3.55 \\times 10^{-15}} \\approx 3.896 \\times 10^{-13} \\, \\text{J}.\n\\]  \nConverting to electron volts:  \n\\[\nU \\approx \\frac{3.896 \\times 10^{-13}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 2.43 \\, \\text{MeV}.\n\\]  \n\nFor lighter nuclei (e.g., \\(Z_2 = 4\\)), the energy reduces to \\(\\sim 1.75 \\, \\text{MeV}\\). The Coulomb barrier height for light nuclei is typically **a few MeV**. While quantum tunneling allows penetration at lower energies, the question asks for the **minimum energy of the order of** the barrier height. Thus, the correct answer is:  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["B"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "B", "expr2": "1 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/2-10", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to estimate the value of r₀ using the given data about the decay of ²⁷₁⁴Si to ²⁷₁₃Al via positron emission. The maximum energy of the positron is given as 3.48 MeV, and the mass difference between the nuclei is attributed to the Coulomb energy. The nuclei are considered uniformly charged spheres with radius R = r₀A¹/³. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in beta-plus decay (positron emission), a proton in the nucleus converts into a neutron, a positron, and a neutrino. The maximum kinetic energy of the positron occurs when the neutrino has negligible energy, so the total energy released (Q-value) is the sum of the positron's kinetic energy and its rest mass energy (m_e c²). The problem states that the maximum (kinetic energy + m_e c²) is 3.48 MeV. So that Q-value is 3.48 MeV. This Q-value should come from the mass difference between the parent and daughter nuclei.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to assume the mass difference is due to the Coulomb energy. So the Coulomb energy difference between the two nuclei is responsible for the Q-value. Therefore, the Coulomb energy difference between ²⁷₁₄Si and ²⁷₁₃Al should equal the Q-value of 3.48 MeV.\n\nCoulomb energy for a uniformly charged sphere is given by the formula: (3/5)(Z² e²)/(4πε₀ R). Since both nuclei have the same mass number A=27, their radii R are the same, R = r₀ A¹/³. The parent nucleus has Z=14 (Si), and the daughter has Z=13 (Al). So the Coulomb energy of the parent is (3/5)(14² e²)/(4πε₀ R), and the daughter is (3/5)(13² e²)/(4πε₀ R). The difference between these two should be the Q-value.\n\nSo the Coulomb energy difference ΔU = (3/5)(14² - 13²)(e²)/(4πε₀ R) = Q = 3.48 MeV.\n\nLet me compute 14² - 13² first. That's (14 - 13)(14 + 13) = 1*27 = 27. So ΔU = (3/5)*27*(e²)/(4πε₀ R) = (81/5)*(e²)/(4πε₀ R).\n\nSo solving for R: R = (81/5)*(e²)/(4πε₀ ΔU). Then since R = r₀ A¹/³, r₀ = R / A¹/³.\n\nBut let's plug in the numbers. Let's recall that e²/(4πε₀) is the Coulomb constant term. The value of e²/(4πε₀) in units of MeV·fm is approximately 1.44 MeV·fm. Wait, because the Coulomb potential between two protons is e²/(4πε₀ r) ≈ 1.44 MeV·fm / r (in fm). So e²/(4πε₀) ≈ 1.44 MeV·fm.\n\nSo substituting into the equation for R:\n\nR = (81/5) * (1.44 MeV·fm) / (3.48 MeV) )\n\nBecause ΔU is 3.48 MeV. The MeV units cancel, so R = (81/5) * 1.44 fm / 3.48.\n\nCompute 81/5 first: 81 ÷ 5 = 16.2.\n\nThen 16.2 * 1.44 = let's calculate that. 16 * 1.44 = 23.04, 0.2 * 1.44 = 0.288, so total 23.04 + 0.288 = 23.328.\n\nThen divide by 3.48: 23.328 / 3.48 ≈ let's see. 3.48 * 6 = 20.88, so 23.328 - 20.88 = 2.448. 2.448 / 3.48 ≈ 0.703. So total is 6 + 0.703 ≈ 6.703. So R ≈ 6.703 fm.\n\nBut wait, A is 27, so A¹/³ = 3. So R = r₀ * 3. Therefore, r₀ = R / 3 ≈ 6.703 / 3 ≈ 2.234 fm.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again step by step to make sure.\n\nFirst, ΔU = (3/5)(Z₁² - Z₂²)(e²)/(4πε₀ R) = Q.\n\nSo solving for R:\n\nR = (3/5)(Z₁² - Z₂²)(e²)/(4πε₀ Q).\n\nPlugging in Z₁=14, Z₂=13, so Z₁² - Z₂²=27. Then:\n\nR = (3/5)*27*(e²/(4πε₀)) / Q.\n\ne²/(4πε₀) is 1.44 MeV·fm. So:\n\nR = (3*27/5) * (1.44 MeV·fm) / (3.48 MeV)\n\nThe MeV cancels, so:\n\nR = (81/5) * 1.44 fm / 3.48\n\nCompute 81/5 = 16.2\n\n16.2 * 1.44 = 23.328\n\n23.328 / 3.48 ≈ 6.703 fm\n\nThen R = r₀ * A^(1/3) => r₀ = R / A^(1/3) = 6.703 fm / 3 ≈ 2.234 fm.\n\nSo approximately 2.23 fm. But let me check if the Coulomb energy difference is correctly calculated.\n\nWait, the Coulomb energy for a nucleus is (3/5)(Z² e²)/(4πε₀ R). So the difference between parent and daughter is (3/5)(Z_parent² - Z_daughter²) e²/(4πε₀ R). That's correct.\n\nBut wait, the Coulomb energy is part of the binding energy. If the parent has higher Z, its Coulomb energy is higher, so the parent is less bound (since Coulomb energy is repulsive). Therefore, the mass of the parent should be higher than the daughter. So when the parent decays to the daughter, the mass difference (which is Q) is the Coulomb energy difference. So yes, the Coulomb energy difference is equal to the Q-value. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nBut let me check the constants again. The value of e²/(4πε₀) in MeV·fm is approximately 1.44 MeV·fm. Yes, because the Coulomb potential between two protons separated by 1 fm is e²/(4πε₀ * 1 fm) = 1.44 MeV. So that's correct.\n\nSo the calculation steps are correct. Then R ≈ 6.703 fm, and since A=27, A^(1/3)=3, so r₀≈6.703/3≈2.234 fm. Rounding to two decimal places, maybe 2.23 fm, but perhaps the answer expects more precise calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute 23.328 divided by 3.48 more accurately.\n\n23.328 ÷ 3.48:\n\n3.48 * 6 = 20.88\n\n23.328 - 20.88 = 2.448\n\nNow, 3.48 * 0.7 = 2.436\n\nSo 6.7 gives 3.48 * 6.7 = 23.316, which is very close to 23.328. The difference is 23.328 -23.316=0.012. Then 0.012 /3.48 ≈0.00345. So total R≈6.7 +0.00345≈6.70345 fm. So R≈6.703 fm.\n\nThen r₀=6.703 /3≈2.2343 fm. So approximately 2.23 fm. But maybe the answer is expected to be around 1.2 fm? Wait, typical r₀ is about 1.2 fm. Wait, this is conflicting. Wait, but in reality, the Coulomb energy is only a part of the binding energy, and the semi-empirical mass formula includes more terms. However, the problem states to assume that the mass difference is due to the Coulomb energy. So perhaps in this approximation, the r₀ comes out larger than the typical 1.2 fm. But maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. The Coulomb energy is (3/5)(Z² e²)/(4πε₀ R). So the difference between parent and daughter is (3/5)(Z_p² - Z_d²) e²/(4πε₀ R). Then set that equal to Q=3.48 MeV.\n\nSo solving for R:\n\nR = (3/5)(Z_p² - Z_d²) (e²/(4πε₀)) / Q.\n\nYes, that's correct. Then plugging in the numbers:\n\n(3/5)*(27)*(1.44 MeV fm) / 3.48 MeV.\n\nYes, the MeV cancels, so R=(3*27*1.44)/(5*3.48) fm.\n\nCalculate numerator: 3*27=81, 81*1.44=116.64.\n\nDenominator:5*3.48=17.4.\n\nSo R=116.64 /17.4 ≈6.7034 fm.\n\nThen R=r₀ A^(1/3), A=27, so A^(1/3)=3. Therefore, r₀=6.7034/3≈2.2345 fm.\n\nBut in reality, the accepted value of r₀ is approximately 1.2 fm. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh, perhaps because the problem assumes that the entire mass difference is due to the Coulomb energy, but in reality, other terms in the binding energy (like the asymmetry term, pairing term, etc.) also contribute. However, the problem explicitly states to assume the mass difference is due to Coulomb energy, so we have to go with that. Therefore, according to this calculation, r₀≈2.23 fm. But that's larger than the standard value. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the Coulomb energy difference is not the entire Q-value. Wait, the Q-value is the mass difference between the parent and daughter, which includes the rest mass of the positron and the neutrino. But in beta decay, the Q-value is (M_parent - M_daughter)c² = energy released. But since the daughter has one less proton and one more neutron, the mass difference would also involve the difference in nuclear binding energy beyond just Coulomb energy. However, the problem states to assume the mass difference is due to Coulomb energy. So perhaps in this hypothetical scenario, the only difference in mass comes from the Coulomb energy. Therefore, the calculation is correct under that assumption, even if it gives a higher r₀ than typical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the sign. Wait, the Coulomb energy is higher for the parent (Z=14) than the daughter (Z=13), so the parent has higher Coulomb energy, which is less binding. Therefore, the parent is less tightly bound, so its mass is higher. Therefore, the mass difference (parent - daughter) should be equal to the Coulomb energy difference. So Q = (M_parent - M_daughter)c² = ΔU_Coulomb. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nBut why does the r₀ come out larger than the empirical value? Because in reality, other terms contribute to the binding energy, so the actual Coulomb energy difference is smaller than the total mass difference. But in this problem, we are told to attribute the entire mass difference to Coulomb energy, leading to a larger r₀. Therefore, the answer according to the problem's assumptions is approximately 2.23 fm. However, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps.\n\nWait, let me check the constants again. The value of e²/(4πε₀) is approximately 1.44 MeV·fm. Yes, because e²/(4πε₀) in SI units is (1.602e-19 C)²/(4π*8.85e-12 F/m) = 2.307e-28 J·m. Converting to MeV·fm: 1 J = 6.242e12 MeV, so 2.307e-28 J·m = 2.307e-28 *6.242e12 MeV·m = 1.44e-15 MeV·m = 1.44 MeV·fm (since 1 m = 1e15 fm). So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation steps are correct. So the answer is r₀≈2.23 fm. But since the problem says \"estimate\", maybe we should round to two significant figures, so 2.2 fm or 2.3 fm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.\n\nWait, another thought: the positron emission also requires the creation of a positron, which has a rest mass of 0.511 MeV. The Q-value is the maximum kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Wait, the problem states \"maximum (kinetic energy + m_e c²) energy of the positron is 3.48 MeV\". So that is the total energy, which is the Q-value. So Q = 3.48 MeV. Therefore, the mass difference between the parent and daughter is Q/c², but since we are equating the Coulomb energy difference to Q, the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Coulomb energy difference is actually the difference in the Coulomb energy of the parent and daughter nuclei. But the Coulomb energy is part of the binding energy. The binding energy is the energy that holds the nucleus together, so a higher Coulomb energy means less binding (since it's repulsive). Therefore, the parent nucleus (higher Z) has higher Coulomb energy, so it's less bound. The difference in binding energy between daughter and parent would be positive (daughter is more bound), which corresponds to the energy released (Q-value). Therefore, ΔU_Coulomb = U_parent - U_daughter = Q. So yes, the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, under the problem's assumptions, r₀≈2.23 fm. But since the standard value is around 1.2 fm, this suggests that the assumption that the entire mass difference is due to Coulomb energy is not accurate, which is expected because other terms in the binding energy formula (like the asymmetry term, volume term, surface term, etc.) also contribute. However, the problem instructs us to ignore those and only consider Coulomb energy, so the answer is 2.23 fm.\n\nBut let me check once more the calculation:\n\nR = (3/5)*(14² -13²)*(e²/(4πε₀)) / Q\n\n= (3/5)*27*1.44 MeV·fm /3.48 MeV\n\n= (81/5)*1.44 /3.48 fm\n\n= 16.2 *1.44 /3.48 fm\n\n16.2 *1.44 = 23.328\n\n23.328 /3.48 ≈6.703 fm\n\nR=6.703 fm\n\nr₀= R /A^(1/3)=6.703 /3≈2.234 fm\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is approximately 2.23 fm. But the problem says \"estimate\", so maybe rounding to one decimal place: 2.2 fm or 2.3 fm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an answer closer to the standard r₀=1.2 fm, but given the problem's constraints, the calculation leads to ~2.23 fm. Therefore, the answer should be \\boxed{2.2 \\text{ fm}} or similar. However, let me check if there's a miscalculation.\n\nWait, another possible error: the Coulomb energy formula. For a uniformly charged sphere, the Coulomb energy is (3/5)(Z²e²)/(4πε₀R). But when we take the difference between two nuclei with different Z but same A (hence same R), the difference is (3/5)(Z₁² - Z₂²)e²/(4πε₀R). Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the charge is (Z-1)e for the daughter? Wait, no. The problem states the nuclei are uniformly charged spheres of charge Ze. So the parent has charge 14e, daughter 13e. Therefore, the Coulomb energies are (3/5)(14² e²)/(4πε₀ R) and (3/5)(13² e²)/(4πε₀ R). The difference is (3/5)(14² -13²)e²/(4πε₀ R). Correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. So the answer is approximately 2.23 fm. But since the problem might expect an answer in terms of r₀ with one decimal place, maybe 2.2 fm or 2.3 fm. Let me compute 6.703 divided by 3 again: 6.703 /3 = 2.234333... So approximately 2.23 fm. But perhaps using more precise constants.\n\nWait, the value of e²/(4πε₀) is approximately 1.439978 MeV·fm. Let's use that instead of 1.44 for more precision.\n\nSo R = (81/5) *1.439978 /3.48\n\nFirst, 81/5=16.2\n\n16.2 *1.439978 ≈16.2*1.44=23.328, but with the exact value:\n\n1.439978 *16 =23.03965, 1.439978*0.2=0.2879956, total=23.03965+0.2879956≈23.3276.\n\nThen 23.3276 /3.48 ≈6.7033 fm. So same result. Therefore, r₀≈2.23 fm.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is approximately 2.2 fm. But let me check if the problem expects the answer in a different unit or if I missed a factor.\n\nWait, another thought: the Coulomb energy difference is the difference in the Coulomb energies of the two nuclei. But when the parent decays, it emits a positron, which is a lepton, so the nuclear charge decreases by 1 (from 14 to 13). However, the Coulomb energy is calculated for the entire nucleus. Therefore, the calculation is correct as done.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mass difference is between the atoms, not the nuclei. But the problem states \"nucleus\" decays to \"mirror nucleus\", so it's nucleus to nucleus. Therefore, atomic mass difference would include the electrons, but since it's positron emission, the daughter has one less proton, so the atom would have one less electron. But the problem says to consider the nuclei, so electrons are not considered here. Therefore, the calculation remains correct.\n\nTherefore, the estimated r₀ is approximately 2.23 fm. Rounding to two significant figures, 2.2 fm. So the final answer is \\boxed{2.2 \\text{ fm}}.\n</think>\n\nThe nucleus \\(^{27}_{14}\\text{Si}\\) decays to \\(^{27}_{13}\\text{Al}\\) via positron emission with a maximum energy (kinetic energy + \\(m_e c^2\\)) of 3.48 MeV.

{"id": "atomic/2-17", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve part (a) and (b) of this physics problem. Let's start with part (a). The question is about using the Born approximation to calculate the scattering cross section σ for a given potential energy V. The potential is given as V = (qQ e^{-αr}) / r. \n\nFirst, I remember that the Born approximation formula for the scattering amplitude f is given by:\n\nf = - (1/(4π)) ∫ e^{-i Δk · r} (2m/ħ²) V(r) d³r\n\nHere, Δk is the momentum transfer vector, which is equal to k' - k, where k is the initial wave vector and k' is the scattered wave vector. But in elastic scattering, the magnitude of k and k' are the same, so |k| = |k'|. The magnitude of Δk can be related to the scattering angle θ. I think the magnitude |Δk| is 2k sin(θ/2), right? Because in elastic scattering, the momentum transfer is related to the angle through that formula. But maybe for the integral, I need to express it in terms of the variable q, which is often used as the magnitude of Δk. Let me confirm: yes, sometimes they use q = |Δk| = 2k sin(θ/2). But maybe for the integral, I can just keep it as Δk for now.\n\nThe potential here is V(r) = (qQ e^{-αr}) / r. So substituting this into the Born approximation integral:\n\nf = - (1/(4π)) * (2m/ħ²) * qQ ∫ e^{-i Δk · r} (e^{-αr}/r) d³r\n\nSo the integral becomes ∫ [e^{-i Δk · r} * e^{-αr} / r] d³r. Hmm, this looks like a standard integral in 3D. I think this is similar to the Fourier transform of the Yukawa potential. The Yukawa potential is exactly of the form e^{-αr}/r, and its Fourier transform is known. Let me recall: the Fourier transform of e^{-αr}/r in 3D is 4π / (α² + |k|²). Wait, let me check that.\n\nThe integral ∫ e^{-i k · r} (e^{-μ r}/r) d³r. Let's use spherical coordinates. Let’s set the z-axis along the vector k, so that k · r = kr cosθ. Then the integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^∞ ∫₀^π ∫₀^{2π} e^{-i k r cosθ} e^{-μ r} / r * r² sinθ dφ dθ dr\n\nThe φ integral gives 2π. Then the θ integral: ∫₀^π e^{-i k r cosθ} sinθ dθ. Let’s substitute u = cosθ, du = -sinθ dθ. Then the integral becomes ∫_{-1}^1 e^{-i k r u} du = [e^{-i k r u} / (-i k r)] from -1 to 1 = (1/( -i k r ))[e^{-i k r} - e^{i k r}] = (1/( -i k r ))[ -2i sin(kr) ] = (2 sin(kr))/(k r)\n\nSo the integral becomes 2π * ∫₀^∞ [2 sin(kr)/(k r)] e^{-μ r} r² dr / r\n\nSimplify: 2π * (2/k) ∫₀^∞ sin(kr) e^{-μ r} dr\n\nThe integral ∫₀^∞ sin(kr) e^{-μ r} dr is a standard integral. The integral of sin(ax) e^{-bx} dx from 0 to ∞ is a/(a² + b²). So here, a = k, b = μ. Therefore, the integral is k/(k² + μ²). \n\nPutting it all together: 2π * (2/k) * [k/(k² + μ²)] = 2π * 2/(k² + μ²) = 4π/(k² + μ²)\n\nTherefore, the Fourier transform of e^{-μ r}/r is 4π/(μ² + k²). So in our case, the integral ∫ e^{-i Δk · r} (e^{-α r}/r) d³r = 4π/(α² + |Δk|²)\n\nTherefore, substituting back into the expression for f:\n\nf = - (1/(4π)) * (2m/ħ²) * qQ * [4π/(α² + |Δk|²)]\n\nSimplify this: The 4π cancels with the 1/(4π), so we get:\n\nf = - (2m q Q)/(ħ²) * 1/(α² + |Δk|²)\n\nBut wait, the Born approximation formula might have a negative sign here. Let me check the original formula. The formula given is:\n\nf = - (1/(4π)) ∫ e^{-i Δk · r} (2m/ħ²) V(r) d³r\n\nSo substituting V(r) = qQ e^{-α r}/r, then:\n\nf = - (1/(4π)) * (2m/ħ²) * qQ * ∫ e^{-i Δk · r} (e^{-α r}/r) d³r\n\nWhich we found the integral to be 4π/(α² + |Δk|²). Therefore:\n\nf = - (1/(4π)) * (2m q Q / ħ²) * (4π)/(α² + |Δk|²) = - (2m q Q / ħ²) * (1)/(α² + |Δk|²)\n\nBut the negative sign here. Wait, the Born approximation formula already has a negative sign. So the final f is:\n\nf = - (2m q Q)/(ħ² (α² + |Δk|²))\n\nBut wait, the integral gave a positive 4π/(α² + |Δk|²), and then multiplied by - (1/(4π)) * (2m q Q / ħ²). So the negatives cancel? Let me check:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nf = - (1/(4π)) * (2m/ħ²) * qQ * [4π/(α² + |Δk|²)]\n\nSo the 4π in the numerator cancels with the 1/(4π) in the denominator, leaving:\n\nf = - (2m q Q / ħ²) * 1/(α² + |Δk|²)\n\nBut wait, the negative sign is still there. So f is equal to - (2m q Q)/(ħ² (α² + |Δk|²)). But in scattering cross sections, the differential cross section is |f|². So the sign might not matter, but let's just keep it as is.\n\nNow, the differential cross section dσ/dΩ is |f|². Therefore:\n\ndσ/dΩ = |f|² = [ (2m q Q)/(ħ² (α² + |Δk|²)) ]²\n\nBut we need to express |Δk| in terms of the scattering angle θ. As I mentioned earlier, in elastic scattering, |Δk| = 2k sin(θ/2). Let me confirm this. The momentum transfer Δk = k' - k. The magnitude squared is |Δk|² = |k' - k|² = k² + k² - 2k k' cosθ. Since |k| = |k'| = k (elastic scattering), this becomes 2k²(1 - cosθ) = 4k² sin²(θ/2). Therefore, |Δk| = 2k sin(θ/2). So |Δk|² = 4k² sin²(θ/2).\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for dσ/dΩ:\n\ndσ/dΩ = [ (2m q Q)/(ħ² (α² + 4k² sin²(θ/2)) ) ]²\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (4 m² q² Q²)/(ħ^4 (α² + 4k² sin²(θ/2))² )\n\nTherefore, the total cross section σ would be the integral of dσ/dΩ over all solid angles. But the problem just says \"calculate the scattering cross section σ\". Depending on the context, sometimes σ refers to the differential cross section, but more likely here, since part (a) says \"calculate the scattering cross section σ\", maybe they just want the differential cross section expression. But let me check. Wait, the scattering cross section σ is often the total cross section, but in scattering problems, especially in Born approximation, they usually ask for the differential cross section. However, the question says \"scattering cross section σ\", which is a bit ambiguous. Wait, but in part (a), the formula given is for f, which is the scattering amplitude, and the cross section is |f|², so maybe they just want the differential cross section. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"(a) Use the Born approximation [...] to calculate the scattering cross section σ.\" So maybe they just want the differential cross section as a function of θ. So the answer would be the expression for dσ/dΩ as above. But let me make sure. Alternatively, if they want the total cross section, we need to integrate over all angles. But integrating the differential cross section over the solid angle would give the total cross section. However, given that the potential here is the Yukawa potential, the total cross section might be a standard result. But the problem might just be asking for the differential cross section. Let me check standard Born approximation results. The cross-section in Born approximation for Yukawa potential is indeed proportional to 1/(α² + q²)^2, where q is the momentum transfer. So the differential cross section is [something] / (α² + q²)^2, which is what we have here. Therefore, the answer for part (a) is the differential cross section as derived.\n\nSo putting it all together, the differential scattering cross section is:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (4 m² q² Q²)/(ħ^4 (α² + 4k² sin²(θ/2))² )\n\nAlternatively, since k is related to the energy of the incident particle. Recall that k = p/ħ = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but maybe we can leave it in terms of k. However, the problem might want the answer expressed in terms of the scattering angle θ. So the final expression is as above.\n\nTherefore, part (a) is done. Now part (b): How should α depend on the nuclear charge Z?\n\nHmm. The problem states that α⁻¹ is the screening length of the atomic electrons. So α is the inverse screening length. The screening is due to the atomic electrons around the nucleus. For a nucleus with charge Ze, the electrons will screen it. In atoms, the screening effect depends on the electron cloud. For example, in the Thomas-Fermi model, the screening length depends on Z. The Thomas-Fermi screening wave number is proportional to Z^(1/3). Wait, but let me think. The screening length is related to the electron density. For a higher Z, the atom has more electrons, so the electron density is higher. In Thomas-Fermi theory, the screening length (or the inverse screening parameter) scales as Z^(-1/3). Wait, the Thomas-Fermi screening wavevector is given by k_TF ~ (Z^(1/3))/a_0, where a_0 is the Bohr radius. Therefore, the screening length λ = 1/k_TF ~ a_0 Z^(-1/3). Therefore, α = 1/λ ~ Z^(1/3)/a_0. Therefore, α is proportional to Z^(1/3). So α ∝ Z^(1/3). Therefore, the dependence is α ~ Z^(1/3). \n\nAlternatively, in a hydrogen-like atom, the screening might be different, but in a multi-electron atom, the Thomas-Fermi model suggests that the screening length decreases with increasing Z, so α increases with Z as Z^(1/3). Therefore, the answer is that α is proportional to Z^(1/3). So α ∝ Z^{1/3}.\n\nBut let me think again. The screening length is the distance over which the electric field of the nucleus is screened by the electrons. For higher Z, more electrons are present, so the screening is more effective, meaning the screening length is shorter. Since α is the inverse screening length, a shorter screening length means a larger α. So α increases with Z. The Thomas-Fermi model predicts that the screening wave number k_TF is proportional to (Z/(a_0))^(1/3), so α ~ Z^{1/3}. Therefore, the correct dependence is α ∝ Z^{1/3}.\n\nTherefore, part (b) answer is that α is proportional to Z^{1/3}, so α ∝ Z^{1/3}.\n</think>\n\n(a) Using the Born approximation, the scattering amplitude \\( f \\) is calculated by substituting the given potential \\( V(r) = \\frac{qQ e^{-\\alpha r}}{r} \\) into the integral. The Fourier transform of the Yukawa potential \\( \\frac{e^{-\\alpha r}}{r} \\) is known to be \\( \\frac{4\\pi}{\\alpha^2 + |\\Delta \\mathbf{k}|^2} \\). Substituting this result into the Born approximation formula and simplifying yields the scattering amplitude:\n\n\\[\nf = -\\frac{2m qQ}{\\hbar^2 (\\alpha^2 + |\\Delta \\mathbf{k}|^2)}.\n\\]\n\nThe differential scattering cross section \\( \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} \\) is the square of the scattering amplitude:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left( \\frac{2m qQ}{\\hbar^2 (\\alpha^2 + |\\Delta \\mathbf{k}|^2)} \\right)^2.\n\\]\n\nExpressing \\( |\\Delta \\mathbf{k}| \\) in terms of the scattering angle \\( \\theta \\), where \\( |\\Delta \\mathbf{k}| = 2k \\sin(\\theta/2) \\), the differential cross section becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{4m^2 q^2 Q^2}{\\hbar^4 \\left( \\alpha^2 + 4k^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\right)^2}.\n\\]\n\n(b) The screening length \\( \\alpha^{-1} \\) depends on the nuclear charge \\( Z \\). In the Thomas-Fermi model, the screening length decreases with increasing \\( Z \\), leading to \\( \\alpha \\propto Z^{1/3} \\). This arises because higher \\( Z \\) increases electron density, enhancing screening and reducing the screening length. Thus, \\( \\alpha \\) scales as:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\alpha \\propto Z^{1/3}}.\n\\]\n\nFor part (a), the final differential scattering cross section is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{4m^2 q^2 Q^2}{\\hbar^4 \\left( \\alpha^2 + 4k^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\right)^2}}.\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\alpha \\propto Z^{1/3}", "\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{4m^2 q^2 Q^2}{\\hbar^4 \\left( \\alpha^2 + 4k^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\right)^2}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\alpha \\propto Z^{1/3}", "expr2": "\\sigma = \\frac{16 \\pi m^2 Q^2 q^2}{\\hbar^4 \\alpha^2 (4k_0^2 + \\alpha^2)}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "Z**(1/3)*alpha*propto", "expr2": "16*Q**2*m**2*pi*q**2/(alpha**2*hbar**4*(alpha**2 + 4*k**2))"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\alpha \\propto Z^{1/3}", "expr2": "\\text{\\(\\alpha\\) is an increasing function of \\(Z\\)}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{4m^2 q^2 Q^2}{\\hbar^4 \\left( \\alpha^2 + 4k^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\right)^2}", "expr2": "\\sigma = \\frac{16 \\pi m^2 Q^2 q^2}{\\hbar^4 \\alpha^2 (4k_0^2 + \\alpha^2)}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "4*Q**2*m**2*q**2/(hbar**4*(alpha**2 + 4*k**2*sin(theta/2)**2)**2)", "expr2": "16*Q**2*m**2*pi*q**2/(alpha**2*hbar**4*(alpha**2 + 4*k**2))"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{4m^2 q^2 Q^2}{\\hbar^4 \\left( \\alpha^2 + 4k^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\right)^2}", "expr2": "\\text{\\(\\alpha\\) is an increasing function of \\(Z\\)}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-30", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which of the options (a), (b), or (c) is correct regarding the hyperfine structure of hydrogen. Let me start by recalling what hyperfine structure means. From what I remember, hyperfine structure in atomic spectra refers to the small shifts and splittings in energy levels that are due to interactions between the electron and the nucleus. But wait, the main fine structure comes from relativistic effects and spin-orbit coupling, right? Hyperfine must be even smaller than that.\n\nNow, the question is about hydrogen's hyperfine structure. The options are about whether it's too small to detect, arises from nuclear spin, or from finite nuclear size. Let me think. The hyperfine structure is indeed very small, which is why it's called \"hyperfine.\" But is it too small to detect? I think it's detectable because the 21 cm line in hydrogen, which is due to hyperfine splitting, is actually observed in radio astronomy. So option (a) might be incorrect because it is detected.\n\nThen, option (b) says it arises from nuclear spin. The nucleus has spin, and the interaction between the electron's magnetic moment and the nuclear magnetic moment would cause splitting. That sounds right. The electron's spin interacts with the nucleus's spin, leading to hyperfine splitting. So (b) seems correct.\n\nOption (c) is about finite nuclear size. Finite nuclear size effects usually contribute to other shifts, like the Lamb shift, which is part of the fine structure corrections but not hyperfine. The finite size would affect the electric potential the electron experiences, but hyperfine is more about magnetic interactions between the nucleus and electron. So (c) might not be the right answer here.\n\nPutting it all together: Hyperfine structure in hydrogen arises from the interaction between the electron and the nucleus's spin (magnetic dipole interaction), which is option (b). The 21 cm line is a result of this, so it's definitely detectable, ruling out (a). Finite nuclear size is a different effect, so (c) is incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer should be (b).\n</think>\n\nThe hyperfine structure in hydrogen arises due to the interaction between the magnetic moments of the electron and the nucleus. This interaction is influenced by the nuclear spin, which creates a small splitting in energy levels. The 21 cm hydrogen line, a well-known observational feature in radio astronomy, is a direct consequence of this hyperfine splitting, confirming its detectability. Finite nuclear size effects, on the other hand, contribute to shifts like the Lamb shift but are unrelated to hyperfine structure.

{"id": "atomic/2-28", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking about the binding energy of nuclei and whether it's proportional to A (mass number) or A squared. Then there are follow-up questions about the coefficient, the reasoning behind the A dependence, the property of nucleon-nucleon forces involved, and why neutrons in nuclei are stable against decay while lambda particles in hypernuclei aren't. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what binding energy is. Binding energy is the energy required to split a nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons. The more binding energy per nucleon, the more stable the nucleus. \n\nFrom what I remember, the semi-empirical mass formula (Bethe-Weizsäcker formula) models the binding energy of nuclei. The formula has several terms: volume, surface, Coulomb, asymmetry, and pairing. The leading term is the volume term, which is proportional to A. That suggests that binding energy is more nearly proportional to A, not A squared. But wait, the volume term is positive and contributes to binding, so the total binding energy increases with A, but how exactly?\n\nWait, the formula is B = a_V*A - a_S*A^(2/3) - a_C*Z^2/A^(1/3) - a_A*(A-2Z)^2/A + ... So the dominant term is a_V*A. Therefore, the binding energy is approximately proportional to A. So the answer should be that it's proportional to A.\n\nBut the question says \"more nearly proportional to A or A^2\". Since the leading term is linear in A, the answer is A. The surface term is a correction that reduces the binding energy, but the main dependence is A. \n\nNext, the numerical value of the coefficient. The volume term coefficient a_V is around 15.5 MeV. But wait, the total binding energy is approximately 15.5 MeV per nucleon times A, so the coefficient would be about 15.5 MeV per nucleon. Wait, but the question is about the coefficient when binding energy is proportional to A. So if B ≈ a_V*A, then the coefficient is a_V, which is around 15.5 MeV. But actually, the total binding energy is around 15.5 MeV multiplied by A. For example, for a nucleus with A=200, B≈15.5*200 = 3100 MeV. But the actual binding energy per nucleon peaks around 8.8 MeV for iron, so maybe I'm mixing up the terms here. Wait, the semi-empirical formula gives the total binding energy. The volume term is a_V*A, where a_V is about 15.5 MeV. Then the surface term subtracts something like a_S*A^(2/3), which is about 17 MeV*(A^(2/3)), but the coefficients might be different. Wait, let me check the typical values for the coefficients in the Bethe-Weizsäcker formula. \n\nThe standard coefficients are approximately:\na_V (volume term) ≈ 15.5 MeV\na_S (surface term) ≈ 16.8 MeV\na_C (Coulomb term) ≈ 0.715 MeV\na_A (asymmetry term) ≈ 23 MeV\na_P (pairing term) ≈ 34 MeV (but this is for even-even nuclei, etc.)\n\nSo the volume term is +15.5*A MeV. The next term is -16.8*A^(2/3) MeV. So the leading term is indeed proportional to A, so the binding energy is more nearly proportional to A. Therefore, the coefficient is approximately 15.5 MeV. But wait, the actual binding energy per nucleon is around 8 MeV for heavy nuclei because of the other terms. But the question is about the coefficient involved when considering the proportionality. So if B ≈ a_V*A, then the coefficient is a_V ≈ 15.5 MeV. But the actual total binding energy is less than that due to the other terms. However, the question is asking for the coefficient involved in the proportionality. So the answer would be approximately 15 MeV per nucleon? Wait, no. The coefficient is 15.5 MeV, but since the binding energy is proportional to A, the coefficient is 15.5 MeV multiplied by A? Wait, no. Let me think again. If B is proportional to A, then B = k*A, so k is the coefficient. The units would be MeV, because B is in MeV, and A is dimensionless. Wait, no. If B = k*A, then k has units of MeV. For example, if A=1 (a single nucleon), then B=k*1. But a single nucleon has zero binding energy. Hmm, maybe the coefficient is in MeV per nucleon. Wait, the binding energy per nucleon is B/A ≈ 8 MeV, but the volume term contributes 15.5 MeV per nucleon, and the other terms subtract from that. So the coefficient in the proportionality (the volume term) is 15.5 MeV per nucleon. But when you say the binding energy is proportional to A, the coefficient would be 15.5 MeV per nucleon. So the coefficient is 15.5 MeV. Wait, but if B = 15.5*A MeV, then the units of the coefficient are MeV. Because A is a number. So the coefficient is 15.5 MeV. But actually, the volume term is a_V*A, where a_V is 15.5 MeV. So the coefficient is 15.5 MeV. So the answer is that the binding energy is more nearly proportional to A, with a coefficient of approximately 15.5 MeV. \n\nNow, how can this A dependence be understood? The volume term comes from the idea that each nucleon interacts with its nearest neighbors, so the binding energy is proportional to the number of nucleons. This is similar to a liquid drop model, where each molecule contributes to the cohesive energy. This implies that the nuclear force is short-ranged, meaning that each nucleon only interacts with nearby nucleons, not all nucleons in the nucleus. If the force had a long range, like the Coulomb force, then each proton would interact with all others, leading to a term proportional to Z(Z-1), which is more like A^2 if Z is proportional to A. But since the nuclear force is short-ranged, the total binding energy scales with A. Therefore, the important property is that the nuclear force is short-ranged or saturates. This is called saturation. The nuclear force saturates, meaning that each nucleon only interacts with a limited number of neighbors, leading to binding energy proportional to A. \n\nFinally, why is a neutron bound in a nucleus stable against decay while a lambda particle in a hypernucleus is not? A free neutron is unstable and decays via beta decay with a half-life of about 10 minutes. But when a neutron is in a nucleus, the Pauli exclusion principle plays a role. The decay of a neutron into a proton, electron, and antineutrino is only possible if there's an available state for the proton. In many nuclei, the proton energy levels are filled up to a certain point, so the decay is blocked because the resulting proton would have to occupy an already filled state. Additionally, the binding energy of the nucleus makes the decay energetically unfavorable. \n\nFor a lambda particle in a hypernucleus, the lambda is a hyperon (composed of up, down, strange quarks). The lambda can decay via the weak interaction into a nucleon and a pion (for example, Λ → p + π^- or n + π^0). However, in a hypernucleus, the lambda is embedded in the nucleus. But unlike the neutron, the lambda's decay is not suppressed by the Pauli exclusion principle because the decay products (nucleon and pion) don't necessarily have their states blocked. The nucleon produced might have an available state, but the main difference is that the lambda's decay is a weak interaction process, and the timescale is much shorter compared to the strong interaction timescales that govern nuclear binding. However, wait, the lambda's lifetime in free space is about 2.6×10^-10 seconds, which is much shorter than the neutron's 10 minutes. But even in the hypernucleus, the lambda still decays because the weak interaction is not suppressed enough by the nuclear environment. The Pauli exclusion principle doesn't prevent the decay because the decay products include a pion, which is a boson and doesn't obey the exclusion principle, and the nucleon might find an available state. Alternatively, the binding energy of the lambda in the hypernucleus isn't sufficient to prevent the decay. The neutron in a nucleus is stabilized because the decay would require the resulting proton to be in a lower energy state, but if all lower states are filled, the decay is energetically forbidden. The lambda, however, doesn't have such a suppression mechanism, so it decays despite being in a hypernucleus.\n</think>\n\nThe binding energy of nuclei is more nearly proportional to \\( A \\) (the mass number) rather than \\( A^2 \\). This proportionality arises from the **saturation** property of the nuclear force, where each nucleon interacts only with its nearest neighbors, leading to a binding energy that scales linearly with \\( A \\). \n\nThe numerical value of the coefficient in the dominant volume term of the semi-empirical mass formula is approximately **15.5 MeV**. This term reflects the average binding energy contribution per nucleon due to the short-range nuclear force.\n\nThe \\( A \\)-dependence is understood through the **liquid drop model**, where the nucleus behaves like a droplet of incompressible nuclear fluid. The saturation property implies that nucleon-nucleon forces are **short-ranged** and **saturating**, meaning nucleons interact only with nearby neighbors, preventing the binding energy from scaling with \\( A^2 \\).\n\nA neutron bound in a nucleus is stable against decay due to the **Pauli exclusion principle** and energy conservation. The decay products (proton, electron, antineutrino) must occupy available quantum states, which are often blocked in a filled nucleus. In contrast, a lambda particle in a hypernucleus decays via the weak interaction (e.g., \\( \\Lambda \\to p + \\pi^- \\)) because its decay products (pion and nucleon) are not Pauli-blocked, and the nuclear environment does not provide sufficient energy to inhibit the decay.\n\nFinal answers:  \nBinding energy proportionality: \\[ \\boxed{A} \\]  \nCoefficient: \\[ \\boxed{15.5\\ \\text{MeV}} \\]  \nProperty of nuclear force: \\[ \\boxed{\\text{Saturation}} \\]  \nNeutron stability: Pauli exclusion and energy conservation; lambda decay: weak interaction dominance.", "final_answers": ["A", "15.5\\ \\text{MeV}", "\\text{Saturation}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "A", "expr2": "\\text{Binding energy is proportional to } A \\text{ with a coefficient of } 15.6 \\text{ MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "A", "expr2": "\\text{Nucleon-nucleon forces are called short-range forces}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "15.5\\ \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "\\text{Binding energy is proportional to } A \\text{ with a coefficient of } 15.6 \\text{ MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "15.5\\ \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "\\text{Nucleon-nucleon forces are called short-range forces}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Saturation}", "expr2": "\\text{Binding energy is proportional to } A \\text{ with a coefficient of } 15.6 \\text{ MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Saturation}", "expr2": "\\text{Nucleon-nucleon forces are called short-range forces}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/2-43", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these questions one by one. Starting with part (a). The question is about the type of reaction in a nuclear fission reactor. I remember that nuclear reactors use fission, which is the splitting of heavy nuclei. So, fission reactions involve a heavy nucleus like uranium or plutonium absorbing a neutron and then splitting into lighter nuclei. That process releases energy. So the answer here should be nuclear fission, specifically the splitting of heavy nuclei when they absorb neutrons.\n\nMoving to part (b), why is energy released and how much per reaction. From what I recall, energy is released due to the binding energy per nucleon. When a heavy nucleus splits into lighter ones, the products have higher binding energy per nucleon, which means the total mass is less than the original, and the mass difference is converted into energy via E=mc². The energy per fission reaction is on the order of millions of electron volts. I think each fission event releases about 200 MeV, but I need to confirm that. Yeah, typical is around 200 MeV per fission.\n\nPart (c) asks why the reaction products are radioactive. The fission products are usually neutron-rich isotopes. These isotopes are unstable because they have too many neutrons compared to stable isotopes of their elements. To become stable, they undergo beta decay, where a neutron converts into a proton, emitting an electron (beta particle) and an antineutrino. So the radioactivity comes from the decay of these unstable isotopes.\n\nFor part (d), the moderator's necessity. The moderator slows down the neutrons produced during fission. Fission reactions release fast neutrons, but thermal neutrons (slower) are more effective in causing further fission in uranium-235. The moderator, like water or graphite, slows neutrons through collisions. Light elements are better moderators because they can transfer more kinetic energy per collision. Heavy nuclei won't slow neutrons as efficiently because they have similar mass, so lighter nuclei like hydrogen in water or carbon in graphite are preferred. Wait, but why exactly? Because when a neutron collides with a nucleus of similar mass, like in hydrogen, it loses more energy. If the nucleus is heavy, like lead, the neutron just bounces off without losing much speed. So light elements are better for slowing down neutrons effectively. Hence, moderators use light elements.\n</think>\n\n(a) A nuclear fission reactor operates on the principle of **nuclear fission**, where a heavy nucleus (e.g., uranium-235 or plutonium-239) absorbs a neutron, becomes unstable, and splits into lighter nuclei (fission products), releasing additional neutrons and energy.\n\n(b) Energy is released because the total binding energy per nucleon of the fission products is higher than that of the original heavy nucleus.

{"id": "atomic/4-2", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The problem involves a relativistic meson whose properties change after losing energy. We need to find its rest mass and kinetic energies before and after slowing down. \n\nFirst, I remember that the curvature radius (ρ) of a charged particle's trajectory in a magnetic field is related to its momentum. The formula is ρ = p/(qB), where p is momentum, q is charge, and B is the magnetic field. The product (ρB) would then be p/q. Since the charge q is the same before and after (it's the same particle), the ratio of (ρB) values gives the ratio of momenta. \n\nGiven (ρB)₁ = 2.7 T·m and (ρB)₂ = 0.34 T·m. So, p₁/p₂ = 2.7 / 0.34 ≈ 7.941. That's the momentum ratio before and after slowing down.\n\nNext, after slowing down, the meson's speed is given as v₂ = 1.8e8 m/s. Let's compute the Lorentz factor γ₂ for the slow meson. The speed is 1.8e8 m/s, which is 0.6c (since c ≈ 3e8 m/s). So, β₂ = v₂/c = 0.6. Then γ₂ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.\n\nFor the slow meson, the total energy is E₂ = γ₂ m c², and the momentum p₂ = γ₂ β₂ m c. Since we have p₂ = (ρB)₂ * q, but since q is constant and we can work in units where q=1 (since it cancels out in ratios), maybe we can express m in terms of p₂ and γ₂ β₂.\n\nWait, let's write the momentum expressions. For the slow meson:\n\np₂ = γ₂ β₂ m c\n\nSimilarly, for the fast meson:\n\np₁ = γ₁ β₁ m c\n\nWe know p₁/p₂ = 2.7 / 0.34 ≈ 7.941. So,\n\n(γ₁ β₁) / (γ₂ β₂) = 7.941\n\nBut we know γ₂ = 1.25 and β₂ = 0.6. So, γ₂ β₂ = 1.25 * 0.6 = 0.75. Therefore,\n\nγ₁ β₁ = 7.941 * 0.75 ≈ 5.956\n\nSo, γ₁ β₁ ≈ 5.956. Let's denote this as equation (1).\n\nWe need another equation to relate γ₁ and β₁. Since γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²), we can express β in terms of γ. Let's let x = γ₁. Then β₁ = sqrt(1 - 1/x²). So,\n\nx * sqrt(1 - 1/x²) ≈ 5.956\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\nx² (1 - 1/x²) = (5.956)^2\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nx² - 1 = (5.956)^2 ≈ 35.47\n\nSo, x² ≈ 35.47 + 1 = 36.47 → x ≈ sqrt(36.47) ≈ 6.04. Therefore, γ₁ ≈ 6.04.\n\nThen β₁ = sqrt(1 - 1/x²) = sqrt(1 - 1/(6.04)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/36.48) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.0274) ≈ sqrt(0.9726) ≈ 0.986. So, β₁ ≈ 0.986c.\n\nNow, we can find the rest mass m. Let's use the slow meson data. From p₂ = γ₂ β₂ m c. We have p₂ = (ρB)₂ = 0.34 T·m (assuming q=1, since charge is same and units are in SI, but wait, actually, in SI units, the formula is ρ = p/(qB), so (ρB) = p/q. Therefore, p = q (ρB). But since the charge q for a meson is typically e (elementary charge), but maybe here they are using units where q is in terms of e, but since we don't know, perhaps we need to express m in terms of known quantities. Wait, but maybe the charge cancels out. Let me check.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify the charge of the meson. Hmm. But in particle physics, often for a singly charged particle (like a pion), q = e. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we can assume that the charge is e. Let's proceed with that assumption. So, q = e = 1.602e-19 C.\n\nThen, p = e (ρB). So, for the slow meson, p₂ = e * 0.34 T·m. Let's compute that.\n\nBut first, let's compute m. From p₂ = γ₂ β₂ m c. Solving for m:\n\nm = p₂ / (γ₂ β₂ c) = (e * 0.34) / (1.25 * 0.6 * c)\n\nPlugging in numbers:\n\ne = 1.602e-19 C\n\n0.34 T·m * e = 0.34 * 1.602e-19 C·T·m. Wait, Tesla is kg/(s²·A), so T·m = kg/(s²·A) * m = kg·m/(s²·A). Then, C·T·m = (C)·kg·m/(s²·A). Since 1 A = 1 C/s, so C·kg·m/(s²·C/s) ) = kg·m/s. Which is kg·m/s, which is the unit of momentum. So, yes, p has units kg·m/s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula p = 0.3 B ρ (GeV/c) when B is in Tesla, ρ in meters. Wait, that's a common approximation. Let me recall: For a charged particle in a magnetic field, the momentum in GeV/c is approximately p ≈ 0.3 B ρ (where B in Tesla, ρ in meters). So, if (Bρ) is given in T·m, then p (GeV/c) ≈ 0.3 (Bρ). So, for example, (ρB)_1 = 2.7 T·m, so p₁ ≈ 0.3 * 2.7 = 0.81 GeV/c. Similarly, p₂ ≈ 0.3 * 0.34 = 0.102 GeV/c. \n\nWait, that's a useful shortcut. If that's the case, then p₁ = 0.81 GeV/c and p₂ = 0.102 GeV/c. Then, the ratio p₁/p₂ ≈ 0.81 / 0.102 ≈ 7.94, which matches our earlier calculation. So, this seems correct.\n\nTherefore, using this approximation, we can compute the momentum in GeV/c directly. Then, using the relativistic energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But since we are working in units where c=1 (GeV/c for momentum, GeV for energy), then E² = p² + m². \n\nBut wait, the meson's total energy is E = γ m c², and kinetic energy K = (γ - 1) m c². So, we need to find m (rest mass), then compute K₁ and K₂.\n\nGiven that for the slow meson, we have p₂ = 0.102 GeV/c, and we also know its speed v₂ = 0.6c. Let's use the relation between momentum and velocity: p = γ β m. So, p₂ = γ₂ β₂ m. Since γ₂ = 1.25, β₂ = 0.6, then p₂ = 1.25 * 0.6 * m = 0.75 m. Therefore, m = p₂ / 0.75. Since p₂ = 0.102 GeV/c, then m = 0.102 / 0.75 ≈ 0.136 GeV/c². \n\nWait, but GeV/c² is a unit of mass. Converting that to MeV/c², 0.136 GeV = 136 MeV. So, the rest mass m ≈ 136 MeV/c². Let me check that calculation again.\n\nYes: p₂ = γ β m. So, m = p₂ / (γ β). For the slow meson, γ = 1.25, β = 0.6. So, γ β = 0.75. Therefore, m = p₂ / 0.75. If p₂ is 0.102 GeV/c, then m = 0.102 / 0.75 ≈ 0.136 GeV/c² = 136 MeV/c². That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's verify this with the fast meson. For the fast meson, p₁ = 0.81 GeV/c. Using the same rest mass, we can compute γ₁ and β₁. \n\nFrom p₁ = γ₁ β₁ m. So, γ₁ β₁ = p₁ / m = 0.81 / 0.136 ≈ 5.955. Which matches our earlier calculation (equation 1). Then, as before, solving γ β = 5.955. Using γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²), so:\n\nγ β = 5.955 → β = 5.955 / γ. But γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²). Substitute β:\n\nγ = 1/sqrt(1 - (5.955/γ)^2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(1 - (5.955/γ)^2 ):\n\n1 = γ sqrt(1 - (5.955/γ)^2 )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n1 = γ² (1 - (5.955²)/γ² )\n\n1 = γ² - 5.955²\n\nSo, γ² = 1 + 5.955² ≈ 1 + 35.47 ≈ 36.47 → γ ≈ 6.04, which matches our previous result. So, this checks out.\n\nTherefore, the rest mass is approximately 136 MeV/c². Let's keep that as 140 MeV/c² for two-figure accuracy? Wait, 0.136 GeV is 136 MeV. So, 140 MeV/c² when rounded to two significant figures. Wait, but 136 is two figures as 1.4e2, which is 140. But 136 is actually three figures. Wait, the problem says 2-figure accuracy. So, 140 MeV/c².\n\nWait, 136 rounded to two figures is 140. So, m ≈ 140 MeV/c².\n\nNow, compute the kinetic energies before and after.\n\nFor the slow meson (after slowing down):\n\nK₂ = (γ₂ - 1) m c². γ₂ = 1.25, so K₂ = (0.25) * 140 MeV ≈ 35 MeV.\n\nFor the fast meson (before slowing down):\n\nγ₁ ≈ 6.04, so K₁ = (6.04 - 1) * 140 MeV ≈ 5.04 * 140 ≈ 705.6 MeV ≈ 710 MeV (rounded to two figures).\n\nSo, rest mass is approximately 140 MeV, K₁ ≈ 710 MeV, K₂ ≈ 35 MeV.\n\nBut let's check the exact calculation. Let's use m = 136 MeV/c².\n\nThen K₂ = (1.25 - 1) * 136 = 0.25 * 136 = 34 MeV. Rounded to two figures, 34 MeV is 34, which is two figures. Similarly, K₁ = (6.04 - 1) * 136 = 5.04 * 136 ≈ 5 * 136 = 680, plus 0.04*136=5.44 → total 685.44 MeV ≈ 690 MeV. But since the problem says two-figure accuracy, 690 would be 6.9e2, which is two figures as 6.9e2 → 690, but two significant figures would be 6.9e2 → 690, but wait, 6.04 is approximately 6.0 (two figures), so 6.0 -1 =5.0, 5.0 * 140 =700. So, maybe the answer is 700 MeV and 35 MeV. But given that m is 136, which is two figures as 140, but perhaps the problem expects us to use more precise numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps the exact calculation with m=136 MeV:\n\nK₁ = (6.04 -1)*136 =5.04*136= Let's compute 5*136=680, 0.04*136=5.44, total 685.44 MeV. Rounded to two figures, that's 690 MeV. Similarly, K₂=34 MeV, which is two figures. So, the answers would be m=140 MeV (two figures), K₁=690 MeV, K₂=34 MeV. But 34 is two figures, 690 is two as well (6.9e2). Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use more precise values. Let me check the exact numbers again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should not approximate m as 136 but keep more decimals. Let's see:\n\nFrom the slow meson:\n\np₂ = 0.102 GeV/c. Then m = p₂ / (γ₂ β₂) = 0.102 / (1.25 * 0.6) = 0.102 / 0.75 = 0.136 GeV/c² = 136 MeV/c². So, exact value is 136. So, two figures would be 140 MeV/c². But maybe the problem expects three figures? Wait, the problem states 2-figure accuracy. So, 140 MeV/c² for mass, 690 MeV and 34 MeV for kinetic energies. But 34 is two figures, 690 is two (since 6.9e2). Alternatively, 6.9e2 is two significant figures (6 and 9), but 690 is three digits. Wait, no: 690 with two significant figures would be 6.9e2. If it's two figures, it's 6.9e2, which is two significant figures. Similarly, 34 is two. So, the answers would be:\n\nRest mass: 140 MeV (two figures)\n\nK₁: 690 MeV (two figures)\n\nK₂: 34 MeV (two figures)\n\nBut let's check if there's another approach. Maybe using exact formulas.\n\nAlternatively, using the relation for both particles. Since we have two states, maybe we can set up equations.\n\nFor the slow meson:\n\np₂ = γ₂ β₂ m\n\nFor the fast meson:\n\np₁ = γ₁ β₁ m\n\nWe have p₁/p₂ = 2.7 / 0.34 ≈ 7.941. So,\n\nγ₁ β₁ / (γ₂ β₂) = 7.941\n\nWe know γ₂ and β₂: γ₂ = 1.25, β₂ = 0.6. So,\n\nγ₁ β₁ = 7.941 * 1.25 * 0.6 ≈ 7.941 * 0.75 ≈ 5.956\n\nBut we also have γ₁ = 1/sqrt(1 - β₁²). So, substituting:\n\nγ₁ β₁ = 5.956 → β₁ / sqrt(1 - β₁²) = 5.956\n\nLet x = β₁. Then:\n\nx / sqrt(1 - x²) = 5.956\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nx² / (1 - x²) = 35.47\n\nx² = 35.47 (1 - x²)\n\nx² = 35.47 - 35.47 x²\n\nx² + 35.47 x² = 35.47\n\nx² (1 + 35.47) = 35.47\n\nx² = 35.47 / 36.47 ≈ 0.9726\n\nx ≈ sqrt(0.9726) ≈ 0.9862 → β₁ ≈ 0.9862\n\nThen γ₁ = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9862²) ≈ 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9726) ≈ 1/sqrt(0.0274) ≈ 1/0.1655 ≈ 6.04\n\nSo, γ₁ ≈ 6.04.\n\nNow, using the slow meson data to find m:\n\np₂ = γ₂ β₂ m → m = p₂ / (γ₂ β₂)\n\nBut p₂ = 0.34 * 0.3 GeV/c = 0.102 GeV/c (using the approximation p = 0.3 Bρ). So,\n\nm = 0.102 GeV/c / (1.25 * 0.6) = 0.102 / 0.75 ≈ 0.136 GeV/c² = 136 MeV/c².\n\nSo, m = 136 MeV/c². Rounded to two figures, that's 140 MeV/c².\n\nThen, K₁ = (γ₁ - 1) m c² = (6.04 - 1) * 136 ≈ 5.04 * 136 ≈ 685.44 MeV ≈ 690 MeV (two figures).\n\nK₂ = (γ₂ - 1) m c² = (1.25 - 1) * 136 ≈ 0.25 * 136 = 34 MeV.\n\nSo, the answers are:\n\nRest mass: 140 MeV/c²\n\nK₁: 690 MeV\n\nK₂: 34 MeV\n\nBut let's check if using exact p = e B ρ. Maybe the 0.3 approximation is causing some error. Let's compute p using SI units.\n\nThe formula is p = q B ρ. For a charge q = e (assuming it's a singly charged particle), then p = e B ρ. So, (ρB) is given, so p = e (ρB). Let's compute p in SI units, then convert to MeV/c.\n\nFor the slow meson, (ρB)_2 = 0.34 T·m. So,\n\np₂ = e * 0.34 = 1.602e-19 C * 0.34 T·m\n\nBut T = kg/(s²·A), so T·m = kg·m/(s²·A). Then,\n\np₂ = 1.602e-19 C * kg·m/(s²·A) \n\nSince 1 A = 1 C/s, so 1/(A) = s/C. Therefore,\n\np₂ = 1.602e-19 C * kg·m/(s²) * s/C = 1.602e-19 kg·m/s * 0.34\n\nWait, that's p₂ = 0.34 * 1.602e-19 kg·m/s ≈ 5.4468e-20 kg·m/s\n\nNow, convert this to units of MeV/c.\n\n1 MeV/c = (1.602e-13 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 1.602e-13 kg·m²/s² / (3e8 m/s) = 5.34e-22 kg·m/s\n\nSo, p₂ in MeV/c is (5.4468e-20 kg·m/s) / (5.34e-22 kg·m/s per MeV/c) ≈ 102 MeV/c. Which matches the approximation earlier (0.102 GeV/c = 102 MeV/c). So, the approximation is valid. Therefore, the previous calculation using p = 0.3 Bρ GeV/c is accurate enough for this purpose.\n\nThus, the rest mass is indeed approximately 136 MeV/c², which rounds to 140 MeV/c² for two figures. The kinetic energies are approximately 690 MeV and 34 MeV.\n\nNow, part (b). The slow meson has a 50% probability of decaying in 4 meters. We need to compute the intrinsic half-life in its rest frame and the distance for the initial full-energy mesons.\n\nFirst, the 50% probability implies that the proper half-life (τ) is related to the lab frame half-life. The distance traveled is related to the speed and the dilated lifetime. \n\nThe lab frame distance for decay is L = v γ τ, where τ is the proper half-life. But wait, the particle's lifetime is dilated by γ. So, if the half-life in the rest frame is τ, then in the lab frame, the half-life is γ τ. The distance traveled would be L = v γ τ.\n\nGiven that for the slow meson, 50% decay in 4 meters. So, L = 4 m = v₂ γ₂ τ. We can solve for τ.\n\nv₂ = 1.8e8 m/s = 0.6c. γ₂ = 1.25. So,\n\n4 m = 0.6c * 1.25 * τ → τ = 4 / (0.6c * 1.25) = 4 / (0.75c) \n\nc ≈ 3e8 m/s, so:\n\nτ = 4 / (0.75 * 3e8) = 4 / (2.25e8) ≈ 1.777e-8 seconds.\n\nConvert to proper half-life τ. But wait, this is already the calculation. So, τ = 4 / (0.75c) ≈ 4 / (2.25e8) ≈ 1.777e-8 s. \n\nBut we need to express this in appropriate units, maybe seconds or convert to other units. However, the problem asks for the intrinsic half-life in its rest frame, which is τ. So, τ ≈ 1.78e-8 seconds. But perhaps convert to meters using c. Since τ is in seconds, and 1 s = 3e8 m/c. So, τ in meters is τ*c = 1.777e-8 s * 3e8 m/s ≈ 5.333 meters. Wait, but the half-life is a time, so maybe they want it in seconds. Alternatively, particle physicists often use cτ, which is the distance light travels in the lifetime. For example, the pion's cτ is about 7.8 meters. \n\nBut the problem asks for the intrinsic half-life in its own rest frame. So, τ is the proper half-life. So, τ ≈ 1.78e-8 seconds. But maybe convert to more convenient units like nanoseconds. 1.78e-8 s = 17.8 ns. But let's compute it precisely.\n\nτ = 4 / (0.6c * 1.25) = 4 / (0.75c) = 4 / (0.75 * 3e8) = 4 / (2.25e8) ≈ 1.777...e-8 seconds ≈ 17.8 ns.\n\nNow, for the second part: the distance that 50% of the initial full-energy mesons would travel in the lab frame. Here, the initial mesons are the fast ones with γ₁ ≈ 6.04. The proper half-life is τ, so the lab frame half-life is γ₁ τ. The distance is L = v₁ γ₁ τ.\n\nFirst, compute v₁. Earlier, we found β₁ ≈ 0.986, so v₁ ≈ 0.986c ≈ 2.958e8 m/s.\n\nThen, L = v₁ γ₁ τ = 0.986c * 6.04 * τ. But τ is 1.777e-8 s. Let's compute:\n\nL = 0.986 * 3e8 m/s * 6.04 * 1.777e-8 s\n\nFirst compute the constants:\n\n0.986 * 3e8 ≈ 2.958e8 m/s\n\n6.04 * 1.777e-8 ≈ 1.073e-7 s\n\nMultiply them:\n\n2.958e8 m/s * 1.073e-7 s ≈ (2.958 * 1.073) * 1e1 ≈ 3.175 * 10 ≈ 31.75 meters.\n\nSo, approximately 32 meters. Rounded to two figures, that's 32 meters. But let's check the exact calculation.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\nτ = 4 / (0.75c) = 4 / (0.75 * 3e8) = 4 / (2.25e8) ≈ 1.777...e-8 s\n\nThen, L = v₁ γ₁ τ = β₁ c γ₁ τ. Since β₁ γ₁ = 0.986 * 6.04 ≈ 5.955 (from earlier, since p = γ β m c, and we had γ β ≈5.956). So, β₁ γ₁ ≈5.955. Therefore, L = 5.955 * c * τ.\n\nBut c * τ = 3e8 m/s * 1.777e-8 s ≈ 5.333 m. Then, L ≈5.955 *5.333 ≈31.73 meters. So, approximately 32 meters. Rounded to two figures, 32 meters.\n\nBut let's compute it more accurately:\n\nc * τ = 3e8 * 1.777e-8 = 3 * 1.777 = 5.331 m\n\nThen, β₁ γ₁ = 5.955 (from earlier), so L =5.955 *5.331 ≈31.73 m ≈32 m.\n\nTherefore, the answers for part (b):\n\nIntrinsic half-life τ ≈1.78e-8 seconds or 17.8 ns.\n\nDistance for full-energy mesons: ≈32 meters.\n\nBut the problem asks for the intrinsic half-life in its rest frame, which is τ, and the distance for the initial mesons. So, boxed answers would be τ and L.\n\nBut let's confirm the calculation once more. The decay length L is v * γ * τ. For the slow meson, L₂ = v₂ γ₂ τ =4 m. For the fast meson, L₁ = v₁ γ₁ τ. We can compute L₁ = (v₁ γ₁ / (v₂ γ₂)) * L₂. From the slow meson, L₂ =4 m = v₂ γ₂ τ. So, τ = L₂ / (v₂ γ₂). Then, L₁ = v₁ γ₁ * (L₂ / (v₂ γ₂)) ) = L₂ * (v₁ / v₂) * (γ₁ / γ₂)\n\nCompute (v₁ / v₂) = (0.986c) / (0.6c) ≈1.643\n\n(γ₁ / γ₂) =6.04 /1.25≈4.832\n\nMultiply them:1.643 *4.832≈7.94\n\nThen, L₁=4 m *7.94≈31.76 m≈32 m. Which matches the previous result.\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\n(a) Rest mass: 140 MeV/c², K₁=690 MeV, K₂=34 MeV.\n\n(b) τ=17.8 ns (1.78e-8 s), L=32 m.\n\nBut let's present τ in seconds with two figures. 1.78e-8 s is approximately 1.8e-8 s, which is two figures. Similarly, 32 m is two figures.\n\nSo, final answers:\n\n(a) Rest mass: 140 MeV/c², K₁=690 MeV, K₂=34 MeV.\n\n(b) τ=1.8e-8 s, L=32 m.\n</think>\n\n(a) The rest mass of the meson is determined using the momentum and velocity after slowing down. Using relativistic relations, the rest mass is found to be approximately **140 MeV/c²**. The kinetic energies before and after slowing down are calculated using the Lorentz factors, yielding **690 MeV** and **34 MeV**, respectively.\n\n(b) The intrinsic half-life in the rest frame is computed using the decay distance and velocity of the slow meson, resulting in **1.8×10⁻⁸ s**. For the full-energy mesons, the dilated lifetime and velocity lead to a decay distance of **32 meters**.\n\n### Final Answers\n\n(a)  \nRest mass: \\[ \\boxed{140\\ \\text{MeV}/c^2} \\]  \nInitial kinetic energy: \\[ \\boxed{690\\ \\text{MeV}} \\]  \nFinal kinetic energy: \\[ \\boxed{34\\ \\text{MeV}} \\]\n\n(b)  \nIntrinsic half-life: \\[ \\boxed{1.8 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{s}} \\]  \nLaboratory frame distance: \\[ \\boxed{32\\ \\text{m}} \\]", "final_answers": ["140\\ \\text{MeV}/c^2", "690\\ \\text{MeV}", "34\\ \\text{MeV}", "1.8 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{s}", "32\\ \\text{m}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "140\\ \\text{MeV}/c^2", "expr2": "0.14 \\, \\text{GeV/}c^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "690\\ \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "0.14 \\, \\text{GeV/}c^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "690\\ \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "0.68 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "690\\ \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "0.033 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "690\\ \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "2.6 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{s}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "690\\ \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "31 \\, \\text{m}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "34\\ \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "0.14 \\, \\text{GeV/}c^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "34\\ \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "0.68 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "34\\ \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "0.033 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "34\\ \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "2.6 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{s}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "34\\ \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "31 \\, \\text{m}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "1.8 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{s}", "expr2": "0.14 \\, \\text{GeV/}c^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "1.8 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{s}", "expr2": "0.68 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "1.8 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{s}", "expr2": "0.033 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "1.8 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{s}", "expr2": "2.6 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{s}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "1.8 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{s}", "expr2": "31 \\, \\text{m}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "32\\ \\text{m}", "expr2": "0.14 \\, \\text{GeV/}c^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "32\\ \\text{m}", "expr2": "0.68 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "32\\ \\text{m}", "expr2": "0.033 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "32\\ \\text{m}", "expr2": "2.6 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{s}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "32\\ \\text{m}", "expr2": "31 \\, \\text{m}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.2}
{"id": "atomic/4-5", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this muon problem. So, the question is about figuring out how much energy a muon needs to have a fair chance of circling the Earth before it decays. Also, we need to check if Earth's magnetic field is strong enough to keep it in orbit. Hmm, let's start breaking this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that muons are elementary particles similar to electrons but much heavier. Their rest mass is given as 100 MeV/c², and their lifetime at rest is about 2 microseconds. But when they move at relativistic speeds, their lifetime gets extended due to time dilation. That must be key here because if the muon is moving fast enough, from our perspective on Earth, its lifetime would be longer, allowing it to travel further.\n\nThe problem mentions circumnavigating the Earth. So, I need to figure out the distance around the Earth. Let me recall that the Earth's circumference is roughly 40,075 kilometers, which is about 40,075,000 meters. So, the muon needs to travel that distance before decaying. But wait, the muon's lifetime in our frame of reference has to be long enough for it to cover that distance.\n\nBut wait, the muon is moving in a circular orbit due to the Earth's magnetic field. So, the magnetic force provides the centripetal force required for circular motion. Let me remember the formula for the magnetic force: F = qvB, where q is the charge, v is the velocity, and B is the magnetic field. The centripetal force is mv²/r, so setting them equal: qvB = mv²/r. Simplifying, we get r = mv/(qB). So, the radius of the orbit depends on the momentum of the muon, its charge, and the magnetic field strength.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the energy needed, so maybe I need to relate the momentum to the energy. The total energy of a relativistic particle is E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The momentum p is γmv. But since v is close to c for relativistic particles, maybe we can approximate p ≈ γmc. Wait, but actually, the relation between energy and momentum is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². So, if I can find the required momentum to have a certain radius, then I can relate that to energy.\n\nBut first, let's think about the time dilation. The muon's lifetime in the lab frame (Earth's frame) is τ = γτ₀, where τ₀ is the proper lifetime (2 microseconds). The distance it travels is vτ. So, vγτ₀ should be equal to the circumference of the Earth. Wait, but the muon is moving in a circular orbit, so the time to circumnavigate would be the circumference divided by its speed. But the number of times it can go around before decaying would be the total lifetime divided by the orbital period. Wait, maybe I need to ensure that the total time the muon exists in our frame is at least equal to the time it takes to go around once. So, τ = γτ₀ ≥ T, where T is the orbital period.\n\nBut the orbital period T is the circumference divided by the speed: T = (2πr)/v. But from the magnetic force equation, we have r = mv/(qB). So substituting r into T: T = (2πmv/(qB))/v = 2πm/(qB). So T = 2πm/(qB). Therefore, the orbital period is independent of velocity? Wait, that seems odd. Wait, let's check the derivation again.\n\nFrom the magnetic force equation: qvB = mv²/r → r = mv/(qB). Then, the orbital period T is (2πr)/v = (2πmv/(qB))/v = 2πm/(qB). So yes, T is 2πm/(qB), which is independent of velocity. That's interesting. So, regardless of how fast the muon is moving, the orbital period is the same? That seems counterintuitive. Wait, but if the velocity increases, the radius increases (since r = mv/(qB)), so even though the muon is moving faster, it has to go around a larger circle, so the period remains the same. Hmm, that's a key point. So, the orbital period T is fixed once the magnetic field B and mass m are fixed. Therefore, the time it takes to go around once is T = 2πm/(qB). Therefore, the number of orbits the muon can complete before decaying is τ / T = (γτ₀) / T. So, to have a fair chance of completing the journey, we need γτ₀ ≥ T. Wait, but maybe just one orbit? So, τ ≥ T. So, γτ₀ ≥ T. Therefore, γ ≥ T / τ₀.\n\nBut T is 2πm/(qB). So, substituting, γ ≥ (2πm/(qB)) / τ₀. Therefore, γ ≥ (2πm)/(qB τ₀). Then, the energy E = γmc². So, substituting γ from above, E ≥ (2πm²c²)/(qB τ₀). Wait, but this seems a bit complicated. Let me check the units. Let's see, m is in MeV/c², so m²c² would be (MeV²/c⁴) * c² = MeV²/c². Then, denominator is qB τ₀. Charge q for a muon is the same as the electron charge, so e. B is in tesla, τ₀ is in seconds. Hmm, need to make sure the units work out. Maybe I need to express everything in SI units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this. Let's start over.\n\nWe need the muon to live long enough to go around the Earth. The proper lifetime is τ₀ = 2e-6 seconds. The dilated lifetime is γτ₀. During that time, the muon travels a distance approximately equal to the circumference of the Earth. Wait, but if it's moving in a circular orbit, the distance it travels before decaying is v * γτ₀. But to complete the circumnavigation, this distance should be at least equal to the Earth's circumference, which is about 40,075 km. So:\n\nv * γτ₀ ≥ 40,075,000 meters.\n\nBut since the muon is moving at relativistic speeds, v ≈ c. Let's approximate v ≈ c. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nc * γτ₀ ≥ 40,075,000 m.\n\nSo, solving for γ:\n\nγ ≥ 40,075,000 / (c * τ₀).\n\nCompute the right-hand side. c is 3e8 m/s, τ₀ is 2e-6 s.\n\nSo:\n\nγ ≥ 40,075,000 / (3e8 * 2e-6) = 40,075,000 / (6e2) = 40,075,000 / 600 ≈ 66,791.666...\n\nWait, that's a huge gamma factor. Let me check the calculation:\n\n40,075,000 meters divided by (3e8 m/s * 2e-6 s) = 40,075,000 / (3e8 * 2e-6) = 40,075,000 / (6e2) = 40,075,000 / 600 ≈ 66,791.666...\n\nYes, that's correct. So γ ≈ 66,792. Then, the energy E = γmc². The rest mass is 100 MeV/c², so E ≈ 66,792 * 100 MeV ≈ 6,679,200 MeV ≈ 6.68 TeV. That's a very high energy. But wait, is this approach correct?\n\nWait, but earlier I considered the orbital period T, which depends on the magnetic field. But in this approach, I didn't use the magnetic field at all. So, perhaps this is missing the point. Because the magnetic field is necessary to keep the muon in orbit. So, even if the muon has enough energy to live long enough, if the magnetic field isn't strong enough, it can't bend the muon's path into a circular orbit. So, we need to consider both factors: the time dilation to live long enough and the magnetic field strength to provide the necessary centripetal force.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct approach is to first find the required gamma factor so that the muon can travel the circumference, then find the required momentum, and then check if the Earth's magnetic field can provide the necessary centripetal force for that momentum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured such that the required energy is determined by the time dilation needed to survive the trip, and then check if the Earth's magnetic field can bend that muon into a circular path with radius equal to Earth's radius. Wait, but the Earth's radius is about 6,371 km, so the orbit would be at that radius. Wait, but the problem says \"circumnavigate the earth\", so the orbital radius would be approximately Earth's radius. So, the radius r is about 6.371e6 meters.\n\nSo, combining both requirements: the muon must have enough energy to live long enough (gamma factor) and the magnetic field must be strong enough to bend it into a circular orbit of radius ~ Earth's radius.\n\nSo, first, calculate the required gamma factor for the muon to live long enough to travel the circumference. As before, using v ≈ c, then:\n\nTime needed to travel circumference: T_needed = circumference / speed ≈ (40,075,000 m) / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 0.1336 seconds.\n\nBut the muon's lifetime in lab frame is γτ₀. So, γτ₀ ≥ T_needed → γ ≥ T_needed / τ₀ = 0.1336 s / 2e-6 s ≈ 66,800. So, same as before. So, γ ≈ 6.68e4. Then, energy E = γ m c² = 6.68e4 * 100 MeV = 6.68e6 MeV = 6.68 TeV. That's the energy needed.\n\nBut now, we need to check if Earth's magnetic field can keep a muon with that energy in orbit. For that, we need to relate the momentum of the muon to the magnetic field and radius.\n\nThe magnetic force provides the centripetal acceleration: qvB = (γ m v²)/r. Solving for B: B = (γ m v)/(q r). Since for relativistic particles, v ≈ c, so B ≈ (γ m c)/(q r).\n\nLet's compute B. Gamma is 6.68e4, m is 100 MeV/c². Let's convert m to kg. Wait, but maybe it's easier to use natural units where c=1, but perhaps better to use SI units.\n\nWait, m = 100 MeV/c². To convert to kg, 1 MeV/c² is approximately 1.7827e-30 kg. So, 100 MeV/c² = 1.7827e-28 kg.\n\nCharge q of muon is same as electron: 1.602e-19 C.\n\nRadius r is Earth's radius: ~6.371e6 meters.\n\nSo, plugging into B ≈ (γ m c)/(q r):\n\nB ≈ (6.68e4 * 1.7827e-28 kg * 3e8 m/s) / (1.602e-19 C * 6.371e6 m)\n\nLet's compute numerator and denominator step by step.\n\nNumerator: 6.68e4 * 1.7827e-28 * 3e8\n\nFirst, 6.68e4 * 1.7827e-28 = 6.68 * 1.7827 * 1e4 * 1e-28 = approx 11.89 * 1e-24 = 1.189e-23.\n\nThen multiply by 3e8: 1.189e-23 * 3e8 = 3.567e-15.\n\nDenominator: 1.602e-19 * 6.371e6 = 1.602 * 6.371 * 1e-19 * 1e6 = approx 10.21 * 1e-13 = 1.021e-12.\n\nSo, B ≈ 3.567e-15 / 1.021e-12 ≈ 0.00349 Tesla, or about 3.49 milliTesla.\n\nBut Earth's magnetic field is on the order of 25 to 65 microTesla (0.025 to 0.065 milliTesla) at the surface. So, 3.49 milliTesla is about 100 times stronger than Earth's magnetic field. Therefore, Earth's magnetic field is not strong enough to keep the muon in orbit.\n\nTherefore, the muon would need an energy of approximately 6.68 TeV, but Earth's magnetic field is insufficient by about two orders of magnitude.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again for B. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.\n\nLet me recompute B:\n\nNumerator: gamma * m * c = 6.68e4 * 1.7827e-28 kg * 3e8 m/s\n\nFirst, 6.68e4 * 1.7827e-28 = 6.68 * 1.7827 = approx 11.89, so 11.89e4-28 = 11.89e-24 = 1.189e-23.\n\nMultiply by 3e8: 1.189e-23 * 3e8 = 3.567e-15 kg·m/s.\n\nDenominator: q * r = 1.602e-19 C * 6.371e6 m = 1.602 * 6.371 = approx 10.21, so 10.21e-19+6 = 10.21e-13 = 1.021e-12 C·m.\n\nSo, B = 3.567e-15 / 1.021e-12 = 3.567 / 1.021 * 1e-3 ≈ 3.49 * 1e-3 T = 3.49 mT.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3.49 mT. Earth's field is about 50 microTesla (0.05 mT). So, 3.49 mT is about 70 times larger. Therefore, Earth's field is way too weak.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the muon needs about 6.7 TeV of energy, but Earth's magnetic field is insufficient.\n\nBut let me check if there's another approach. Maybe using the relation between momentum, magnetic field, and radius.\n\nThe radius of curvature for a charged particle in a magnetic field is given by r = (p)/(qB), where p is the momentum. So, p = qBr.\n\nBut the momentum p for a relativistic particle is approximately E/c, since E ≈ pc for high energies. Wait, but actually, E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². If the energy is much larger than the rest mass (which it is here, since 6.7 TeV vs 100 MeV), then E ≈ pc. So, p ≈ E/c.\n\nBut in our case, the muon's total energy is E = γmc² = 6.68e4 * 100 MeV = 6.68e6 MeV = 6.68 TeV. So, p ≈ E/c = (6.68e12 eV) / (3e8 m/s) * (1.602e-19 J/eV) → Wait, maybe better to compute p in SI units.\n\nAlternatively, since p = γmv, and for relativistic speeds, v ≈ c, so p ≈ γmc. Then, p = γmc = (6.68e4)(100 MeV/c²)c = 6.68e4 * 100 MeV/c. Since 1 MeV/c is equivalent to 5.34e-21 kg·m/s. So, 6.68e4 * 100 * 5.34e-21 = 6.68e6 * 5.34e-21 = approx 3.57e-14 kg·m/s.\n\nThen, using r = p/(qB), solving for B: B = p/(q r) = (3.57e-14 kg·m/s)/(1.602e-19 C * 6.371e6 m) = 3.57e-14 / (1.02e-12) ≈ 0.035 T = 35 mT. Wait, this is different from the previous 3.49 mT. Wait, why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the unit conversions. Let's try again.\n\nGiven that p = γmv. For a muon with γ = 6.68e4, m = 100 MeV/c². Let's compute p in units of MeV/c. Since p = γmv, and m = 100 MeV/c², v ≈ c, so p ≈ γ m c = γ * 100 MeV/c² * c = γ * 100 MeV/c. Because when you multiply by c, the c cancels one in the denominator: (MeV/c²) * c = MeV/c. So, p ≈ 6.68e4 * 100 MeV/c = 6.68e6 MeV/c = 6.68 TeV/c.\n\nBut 1 MeV/c is equal to (1e6 eV) / (c) ≈ (1e6 * 1.602e-19 J) / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 1.602e-13 J·s/m / 3e8 m/s → Wait, maybe better to use the conversion factor: 1 MeV/c ≈ 5.344e-22 kg·m/s.\n\nSo, 6.68e6 MeV/c * 5.344e-22 kg·m/s per MeV/c = 6.68e6 * 5.344e-22 ≈ 3.57e-15 kg·m/s.\n\nThen, B = p/(q r) = (3.57e-15 kg·m/s)/(1.602e-19 C * 6.371e6 m) = 3.57e-15 / (1.02e-12) ≈ 3.5e-3 T = 3.5 mT. Ah, so this matches the previous result. So, B ≈ 3.5 mT. So, same as before. Therefore, Earth's field is about 0.05 mT, which is much smaller. Therefore, the required B is about 70 times larger than Earth's field.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the muon needs about 6.7 TeV of energy, and Earth's magnetic field is not strong enough.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"assuming that the earth’s magnetic field is strong enough to keep it in orbit\". Wait, the first part of the question is asking for the energy needed under the assumption that the magnetic field is sufficient. Then, the second part is asking if Earth's field is actually strong enough. So, maybe the first part is just based on the time dilation, and the second part checks the magnetic field.\n\nBut the way the question is phrased: \"How much energy would a muon need to circumnavigate the earth with a fair chance of completing the journey, assuming that the earth’s magnetic field is strong enough to keep it in orbit? Is the earth’s field actually strong enough?\"\n\nSo, first, compute the energy required, assuming B is sufficient. Then, check if B is sufficient. So, perhaps the first part only requires considering the time dilation, and the second part checks the B.\n\nBut in reality, both are connected. If you need a certain gamma to live long enough, then that gamma gives a certain momentum, which requires a certain B to bend it into orbit. So, the energy is determined by the gamma needed for time dilation, and then the required B is computed from that momentum. If the required B is higher than Earth's, then the answer is no.\n\nSo, the energy needed is ~6.7 TeV, and Earth's B is insufficient.\n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\nEnergy needed: ~6.7 TeV.\n\nEarth's field is not strong enough.\n\nBut let me check if there's a standard approach to this. For example, in cosmic rays, muons are created in the upper atmosphere and reach the Earth's surface due to time dilation. Their typical energies are much lower than TeV, but they still can reach the surface because even with moderate gamma factors, their lifetime extends enough. For example, a muon with gamma=10 would live 20 microseconds, traveling about 600 meters at nearly light speed. But to go around the Earth, which is 40,075 km, you need a much higher gamma.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects using the circumference as the path length, so L = gamma * c * tau_0. So, L = gamma c tau_0. Therefore, gamma = L/(c tau_0) = 40,075,000 / (3e8 * 2e-6) ≈ 66,800. Then, energy is gamma * m c² = 66,800 * 100 MeV = 6.68 TeV. Then, for the magnetic field, using r = gamma m v / (q B). Assuming v ≈ c, so r = gamma m c / (q B). Solving for B: B = gamma m c / (q r). Plugging numbers, as before, gives B ≈ 3.5 mT, which is much larger than Earth's ~50 microTesla.

{"id": "atomic/2-44", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question about nuclear reactions in controlled thermonuclear fusion. First, I need to recall the three main reactions considered. From what I remember, the most common ones are deuterium-tritium (D-T), deuterium-deuterium (D-D), and deuterium-helium-3 (D-He3). Let me confirm that.\n\nThe D-T reaction is probably the most talked about because it has the highest cross section, meaning it occurs more readily at lower temperatures. The cross section refers to the probability of the reaction happening. So among the three, D-T should have the largest cross section. \n\nNow, the energies released. Each reaction releases different amounts of energy. For D-T, the products are a helium nucleus (alpha particle) and a neutron. The energy is split between them. The neutron carries about 14.1 MeV, and the alpha gets 3.5 MeV. Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think. The total energy is around 17.6 MeV. The neutron, being less massive, would carry most of the energy. So yes, neutron gets 14.1 MeV, alpha 3.5 MeV.\n\nFor D-D reactions, there are two possible branches. One produces tritium and a proton, the other helium-3 and a neutron. The energy released in each branch is different. The first branch (D + D → T + p) releases about 4.03 MeV, and the second (D + D → He3 + n) around 3.27 MeV. Wait, maybe I mixed up the numbers. Let me check. Another source says the first branch gives 4.03 MeV (proton gets 3.02 MeV, tritium 1.01 MeV), and the second gives 3.27 MeV (neutron 2.45 MeV, He3 0.82 MeV). So total energy per reaction is around 4.03 and 3.27 MeV respectively. But since D-D reactions have two branches, maybe the average is considered, but the question asks for the energies in each reaction, so I should list both branches.\n\nThen the D-He3 reaction. That would be D + He3 → He4 + p. The energy here is about 18.3 MeV. The proton would carry most of that, maybe around 14.7 MeV and the alpha (He4) 3.6 MeV. Wait, but I need to get the exact numbers right. Let me verify. The total energy for D-T is 17.6 MeV, D-He3 is 18.3 MeV. So the energies are approximately 17.6, around 4 (for D-D branches), and 18.3 MeV.\n\nNow, the cross section part. The cross section is a measure of the likelihood of the reaction. D-T has the largest cross section at lower temperatures compared to D-D and D-He3. That's why most current fusion research like ITER uses D-T fuel.\n\nRegarding the neutrons produced: in D-T, the neutron is high energy (14.1 MeV). These neutrons are uncharged, so they escape the plasma and can be captured in a lithium blanket, breeding tritium. The kinetic energy of neutrons is converted into heat, which can then be used to generate electricity. In D-D reactions, one of the branches produces neutrons (2.45 MeV), which would also need to be handled similarly. D-He3 produces a proton and He4, which are charged, so fewer neutrons, but He3 is rare on Earth. The use of neutrons would primarily be for breeding tritium (in D-T) and for heat capture.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThree reactions:\n1. D + T → He4 + n (17.6 MeV)\n2. D + D → T + p (4.03 MeV) and D + D → He3 + n (3.27 MeV)\n3. D + He3 → He4 + p (18.3 MeV)\n\nLargest cross section: D-T.\n\nEnergies: 17.6, ~3-4, 18.3 MeV.\n\nNeutrons are used for breeding tritium via lithium blankets and generating heat for electricity.\n</think>\n\nThe three primary nuclear reactions considered for controlled thermonuclear fusion are:\n\n1. **Deuterium-Tritium (D-T) Reaction**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{D} + \\text{T} \\rightarrow {}^4\\text{He} \\, (3.5\\,\\text{MeV}) + \\text{n} \\, (14.1\\,\\text{MeV}) \\quad (\\text{Total: } 17.6\\,\\text{MeV})\n   \\]  \n   This reaction has the **largest cross section** at achievable plasma temperatures (~100–200 million Kelvin), making it the most feasible for near-term reactors like ITER.\n\n2. **Deuterium-Deuterium (D-D) Reactions**:  \n   Two branches occur with roughly equal probability:  \n   - \\[\n     \\text{D} + \\text{D} \\rightarrow \\text{T} \\, (1.01\\,\\text{MeV}) + \\text{p} \\, (3.02\\,\\text{MeV}) \\quad (\\text{Total: } 4.03\\,\\text{MeV})\n     \\]  \n   - \\[\n     \\text{D} + \\text{D} \\rightarrow {}^3\\text{He} \\, (0.82\\,\\text{MeV}) + \\text{n} \\, (2.45\\,\\text{MeV}) \\quad (\\text{Total: } 3.27\\,\\text{MeV})\n     \\]\n\n3. **Deuterium-Helium-3 (D-He³) Reaction**:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{D} + {}^3\\text{He} \\rightarrow {}^4\\text{He} \\, (3.6\\,\\text{MeV}) + \\text{p} \\, (14.7\\,\\text{MeV}) \\quad (\\text{Total: } 18.3\\,\\text{MeV})\n   \\]  \n\n**Neutron Utilization**:  \n- In D-T and D-D reactions, high-energy neutrons escape the plasma due to their lack of charge. These neutrons are absorbed in a **lithium blanket** surrounding the reactor, breeding tritium (via \\( \\text{n} + {}^6\\text{Li} \\rightarrow \\text{T} + {}^4\\text{He} \\)) and converting their kinetic energy into heat for electricity generation.  \n- The D-He³ reaction produces minimal neutrons, reducing radiation hazards, but \\({}^3\\text{He}\\) is scarce on Earth.\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe three reactions are:  \n1. D-T (\\(17.6\\,\\text{MeV}\\)),  \n2. D-D (\\(4.03\\,\\text{MeV}\\) and \\(3.27\\,\\text{MeV}\\)),  \n3. D-He³ (\\(18.3\\,\\text{MeV}\\)).  \n\nThe **D-T reaction** has the largest cross section. Resulting neutrons are used for tritium breeding and heat capture.  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Reactions:} \\\\\n&1.\\ \\text{D + T → } ^4\\text{He + n (17.6 MeV)} \\\\\n&2.\\ \\text{D + D → T + p (4.03 MeV) or } ^3\\text{He + n (3.27 MeV)} \\\\\n&3.\\ \\text{D + } ^3\\text{He → } ^4\\text{He + p (18.3 MeV)} \\\\\n&\\text{Largest cross section: D-T} \\\\\n&\\text{Neutrons used for tritium breeding and power generation.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Reactions:} \\\\\n&1.\\ \\text{D + T → } ^4\\text{He + n (17.6 MeV)} \\\\\n&2.\\ \\text{D + D → T + p (4.03 MeV) or } ^3\\text{He + n (3.27 MeV)} \\\\\n&3.\\ \\text{D + } ^3\\text{He → } ^4\\text{He + p (18.3 MeV)} \\\\\n&\\text{Largest cross section: D-T} \\\\\n&\\text{Neutrons used for tritium breeding and power generation.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Reactions:} \\\\\n&1.\\ \\text{D + T → } ^4\\text{He + n (17.6 MeV)} \\\\\n&2.\\ \\text{D + D → T + p (4.03 MeV) or } ^3\\text{He + n (3.27 MeV)} \\\\\n&3.\\ \\text{D + } ^3\\text{He → } ^4\\text{He + p (18.3 MeV)} \\\\\n&\\text{Largest cross section: D-T} \\\\\n&\\text{Neutrons used for tritium breeding and power generation.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "D + D \\rightarrow {}^3He + n + 3.25 \\text{ MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Reactions:} \\\\\n&1.\\ \\text{D + T → } ^4\\text{He + n (17.6 MeV)} \\\\\n&2.\\ \\text{D + D → T + p (4.03 MeV) or } ^3\\text{He + n (3.27 MeV)} \\\\\n&3.\\ \\text{D + } ^3\\text{He → } ^4\\text{He + p (18.3 MeV)} \\\\\n&\\text{Largest cross section: D-T} \\\\\n&\\text{Neutrons used for tritium breeding and power generation.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "D + D \\rightarrow T + p + 4.0 \\text{ MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Reactions:} \\\\\n&1.\\ \\text{D + T → } ^4\\text{He + n (17.6 MeV)} \\\\\n&2.\\ \\text{D + D → T + p (4.03 MeV) or } ^3\\text{He + n (3.27 MeV)} \\\\\n&3.\\ \\text{D + } ^3\\text{He → } ^4\\text{He + p (18.3 MeV)} \\\\\n&\\text{Largest cross section: D-T} \\\\\n&\\text{Neutrons used for tritium breeding and power generation.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "D + T \\rightarrow {}^4He + n + 17.6 \\text{ MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-29", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the hyperfine splitting in the hydrogen ground state and determine which of the given options (10^{-7}, 10^{-5}, 10^{-3}, 10^{-1} eV) is correct. Hmm, let me start by recalling what hyperfine splitting is. \n\nFrom what I remember, hyperfine splitting arises due to the interaction between the magnetic moments of the electron and the nucleus, which in hydrogen is a proton. The electron has a magnetic moment because of its spin, and the proton also has a spin magnetic moment. The interaction between these two causes a small energy difference between the singlet and triplet states, leading to the hyperfine structure. This splitting is responsible for the 21 cm hydrogen line, which is a famous spectral line in astronomy.\n\nNow, the ground state of hydrogen is the 1s orbital, which has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l=0. Since there's no orbital angular momentum, the splitting here must be purely due to the spin-spin interaction between the electron and proton. The energy difference for hyperfine splitting is much smaller than the fine structure splitting. Fine structure splitting is on the order of 10^{-4} eV, so hyperfine should be even smaller. Wait, but the options here are 10^{-7}, 10^{-5}, etc. So maybe hyperfine is smaller than fine structure.\n\nI think the formula for the hyperfine splitting energy is something like ΔE ≈ (α^4 * m_e / m_p) * Rydberg constant, where α is the fine-structure constant, m_e is the electron mass, m_p is the proton mass, and the Rydberg constant is about 13.6 eV. Let me check that. \n\nThe fine-structure constant α ≈ 1/137. So α^4 would be (1/137)^4 ≈ 1/(137^4). Let me compute that. 137^2 is 18,769, so 137^4 is (18,769)^2 ≈ 3.52×10^8. So 1/3.52×10^8 ≈ 2.84×10^{-9}. Then multiply by m_e/m_p. The mass ratio is about 1/1836. So 2.84×10^{-9} * (1/1836) ≈ 1.55×10^{-12}. Then multiply by the Rydberg constant (13.6 eV). So 1.55×10^{-12} * 13.6 ≈ 2.1×10^{-11} eV. Wait, that's way smaller than any of the options given. Hmm, maybe I messed up the formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hyperfine splitting is given by a different formula. Let me think. The hyperfine splitting energy can also be approximated using the Fermi contact interaction. The formula is ΔE = (8/3) * μ_0/(4π) * g_e * g_p * μ_B * μ_N / (a_0^3) * (1/(m_e c))^2. Wait, that seems complicated. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, μ_0/(4π) is the magnetic constant, which is 1×10^{-7} H/m. The g-factors: for the electron, g_e ≈ 2, and for the proton, g_p ≈ 5.586. The Bohr magneton μ_B is eħ/(2m_e) ≈ 9.27×10^{-24} J/T. The nuclear magneton μ_N is eħ/(2m_p) ≈ 5.05×10^{-27} J/T. The Bohr radius a_0 is about 5.29×10^{-11} m. Then, putting all these into the formula:\n\nΔE = (8/3) * (1e-7 H/m) * 2 * 5.586 * (9.27e-24 J/T) * (5.05e-27 J/T) / (5.29e-11 m)^3 * (1/(m_e c))^2.\n\nWait, this seems too involved. Maybe there's a simpler way. Alternatively, I remember that the hyperfine splitting in hydrogen is about 6 GHz in frequency. To convert that to energy, use E = h f. Planck's constant h is 4.135667696×10^{-15} eV·s. So 6 GHz is 6e9 Hz. Then E = 4.1357e-15 eV·s * 6e9 Hz = 2.4814e-5 eV. Oh, so that's approximately 2.5e-5 eV. Looking at the options, 10^{-5} eV is the closest. So the answer should be 10^{-5} eV.\n\nWait, but the actual value is around 5.9e-6 eV, which is about 6 microelectronvolts. So 6e-6 eV is 6 times 10^{-6}, which is closer to 1e-5 (which is 10^{-5}) but maybe the options are approximate. So among the given options, 10^{-5} eV is the correct order of magnitude. Therefore, the answer is 10^{-5} eV.\n</think>\n\nThe hyperfine splitting in the hydrogen ground state arises from the interaction between the magnetic moments of the electron and proton. This splitting is responsible for the 21 cm spectral line. The energy difference can be estimated using the known frequency of this transition (~1.4 GHz or ~6 GHz when considering the splitting). Converting this frequency to energy via \\( E = h f \\), where \\( h \\approx 4.1357 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{eV·s} \\), gives approximately \\( 6 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{eV} \\).

{"id": "atomic/1-16", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the temperature below which the scattering between hydrogen atoms is essentially s-wave. Hmm, I remember that s-wave scattering is dominant when the thermal de Broglie wavelength is much larger than the range of the potential. That makes sense because if the wavelength is large compared to the potential's range, higher angular momentum states (like p-wave, d-wave, etc.) are suppressed. \n\nFirst, the de Broglie wavelength is given by λ = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum. In thermal equilibrium, the average momentum should be related to the temperature via the thermal energy. So maybe I can use the equipartition theorem or something like that. Wait, but for a gas in thermal equilibrium, the average kinetic energy is (3/2)k_B T, where k_B is Boltzmann's constant. So the kinetic energy per particle is (3/2)k_B T. \n\nBut the kinetic energy is also p²/(2m), so setting those equal: (3/2)k_B T = p²/(2m). Solving for p, we get p = sqrt(3 m k_B T). Then the de Broglie wavelength λ = h / sqrt(3 m k_B T). \n\nBut wait, maybe I should use the thermal de Broglie wavelength formula. Let me recall. The thermal de Broglie wavelength is usually given by λ = h / sqrt(2 π m k_B T). But I might have to check the exact formula. Different sources might have different factors like 2π or not. Let me think. The exact expression might depend on the context. For example, in statistical mechanics, the thermal wavelength often has a factor of sqrt(2π) in the denominator. But perhaps for the purpose of estimating when the wavelength is comparable to the potential range, the exact factor isn't critical. However, since the problem asks for a numerical estimate, I need to be careful with the constants.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the criterion is that the wavelength λ is on the order of the range of the potential, which is given as 4 Å (4 angstroms). So when λ is larger than or comparable to the range of the potential, the scattering is s-wave dominated. Wait, actually, the opposite: when the wavelength is much larger than the range of the potential, the particles don't have enough resolution to probe the details of the potential, so only the s-wave (l=0) contributes. Because higher angular momenta require the wavelength to be smaller so that the particle can have a non-zero impact parameter. \n\nSo the condition for s-wave scattering is that the thermal wavelength λ_th is much larger than the range of the potential, which is 4 Å here. So we need λ_th >> 4 Å. Then, solving for the temperature T where λ_th ≈ 4 Å. The temperature below this would have λ_th larger than 4 Å, so s-wave dominates. \n\nSo let's write the thermal wavelength formula. The thermal de Broglie wavelength is given by:\n\nλ_th = h / sqrt(2 π m k_B T)\n\nWhere:\n- h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J s)\n- m is the mass of a hydrogen atom (approximately 1.67 x 10^-27 kg)\n- k_B is Boltzmann's constant (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K)\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin\n\nWe want λ_th ≈ 4 Å = 4 x 10^-10 m. So set up the equation:\n\n4 x 10^-10 m = 6.626 x 10^-34 J s / sqrt(2 π * 1.67 x 10^-27 kg * 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K * T)\n\nLet me compute the denominator first. Let's compute the product inside the square root:\n\n2 π * 1.67e-27 kg * 1.38e-23 J/K = 2 * 3.1416 * 1.67e-27 * 1.38e-23\n\nFirst multiply 2 * π ≈ 6.2832\n\nThen 6.2832 * 1.67e-27 ≈ 1.67e-27 * 6.2832 ≈ 1.049e-26\n\nThen multiply by 1.38e-23: 1.049e-26 * 1.38e-23 ≈ 1.447e-49\n\nSo the denominator is sqrt(1.447e-49 * T). Wait, no. Wait, the expression is sqrt(2 π m k_B T). So the denominator is sqrt(2 π m k_B T). So when we set up the equation:\n\n4e-10 = 6.626e-34 / sqrt(2 π * 1.67e-27 * 1.38e-23 * T)\n\nLet me compute the denominator inside the square root:\n\n2 π * 1.67e-27 kg * 1.38e-23 J/K = 2 * π * 1.67e-27 * 1.38e-23 ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 1.67 * 1.38 * 1e-50\n\nCalculating the numerical part:\n\n2 * 3.1416 ≈ 6.2832\n\n1.67 * 1.38 ≈ 2.3046\n\nSo 6.2832 * 2.3046 ≈ 14.48\n\nSo total is 14.48 * 1e-50 = 1.448e-49\n\nTherefore, the denominator inside the sqrt is 1.448e-49 * T\n\nSo sqrt(1.448e-49 * T) = sqrt(1.448e-49) * sqrt(T) ≈ 3.806e-25 * sqrt(T)\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n4e-10 = 6.626e-34 / (3.806e-25 * sqrt(T))\n\nMultiply both sides by 3.806e-25 * sqrt(T):\n\n4e-10 * 3.806e-25 * sqrt(T) = 6.626e-34\n\nCompute left side:\n\n4 * 3.806 = 15.224\n\n15.224e-35 * sqrt(T) = 6.626e-34\n\nDivide both sides by 15.224e-35:\n\nsqrt(T) = (6.626e-34) / (15.224e-35) ≈ (6.626 / 15.224) * 10^( -34 + 35 ) ≈ 0.435 * 10^1 = 0.435 * 10 = 4.35\n\nTherefore, sqrt(T) ≈ 4.35\n\nThen T ≈ (4.35)^2 ≈ 18.9 K\n\nSo approximately 19 K. But wait, let me check the calculation again step by step to make sure.\n\nStarting from:\n\n4e-10 = 6.626e-34 / sqrt(2 π m k_B T)\n\nRearranged:\n\nsqrt(2 π m k_B T) = 6.626e-34 / (4e-10)\n\nCompute RHS:\n\n6.626e-34 / 4e-10 = 1.6565e-24\n\nSo sqrt(2 π m k_B T) = 1.6565e-24\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n2 π m k_B T = (1.6565e-24)^2\n\nCompute RHS squared:\n\n(1.6565e-24)^2 ≈ 2.744e-48\n\nThen solve for T:\n\nT = (2.744e-48) / (2 π m k_B )\n\nCompute denominator:\n\n2 π m k_B = 2 * 3.1416 * 1.67e-27 kg * 1.38e-23 J/K\n\nCompute 2*3.1416 ≈ 6.2832\n\n6.2832 * 1.67e-27 ≈ 1.049e-26\n\n1.049e-26 * 1.38e-23 ≈ 1.447e-49\n\nSo denominator is 1.447e-49\n\nTherefore, T ≈ 2.744e-48 / 1.447e-49 ≈ (2.744 / 1.447) * 10^( -48 + 49 ) ≈ 1.896 * 10^1 ≈ 18.96 K\n\nSo approximately 19 K. Therefore, the temperature below which scattering is essentially s-wave is around 19 K. But since the question says \"numerical estimate\", maybe we can round it to 20 K or keep it as 19 K. But let me check if I used the correct formula for the thermal wavelength. \n\nWait, another formula for thermal wavelength is λ = h / sqrt(2 π m k_B T). So that's the same as what I used. So the calculation seems correct. \n\nBut wait, the range of the potential is 4 Å. The thermal wavelength should be larger than this for s-wave scattering. So when λ_th ≈ 4 Å, that's the threshold. So temperatures below that would have λ_th larger than 4 Å, hence s-wave scattering. Therefore, the temperature T is approximately 19 K. So the answer should be around 20 K. But let me check the constants again.\n\nWait, let me recompute the denominator in the T calculation:\n\nAfter squaring both sides:\n\n2 π m k_B T = (6.626e-34 / 4e-10)^2\n\nCompute 6.626e-34 / 4e-10 = 1.6565e-24\n\nSquare that: (1.6565e-24)^2 = 2.744e-48\n\nThen T = 2.744e-48 / (2 π m k_B )\n\nCompute 2 π m k_B:\n\n2 * π ≈ 6.283\n\n6.283 * 1.67e-27 kg = 1.049e-26 kg\n\n1.049e-26 kg * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.447e-49 J kg / K\n\nWait, J is kg m²/s², so units here: kg * J/K = kg*(kg m²/s²)/K = kg² m²/(s² K). Not sure if that's important, but the numerical value is 1.447e-49.\n\nSo T = 2.744e-48 / 1.447e-49 ≈ 18.96 K. So approximately 19 K.\n\nTherefore, the temperature is approximately 19 K. So the answer is \\boxed{20 \\text{ K}} as an estimate, but since the calculation gives ~19 K, maybe boxed as \\boxed{20 \\text{ K}} considering significant figures. Alternatively, if precise, 19 K. But let me check constants again.\n\nWait, let's plug in all the constants step by step:\n\nh = 6.62607015e-34 J s (exact value, since 2019 definition, but for estimation, 6.626e-34 is fine)\n\nm = mass of hydrogen atom: approximately 1.6735575e-27 kg (proton mass is about 1.67e-27 kg, but hydrogen atom is proton plus electron, but electron mass is ~1/1836, so negligible. So m ≈ 1.67e-27 kg.\n\nk_B = 1.380649e-23 J/K\n\nSo let's compute the denominator in T:\n\n2 * π * m * k_B = 2 * 3.1415926536 * 1.6735575e-27 kg * 1.380649e-23 J/K\n\nFirst compute 2 * π ≈ 6.283185307\n\n6.283185307 * 1.6735575e-27 ≈ 1.6735575e-27 * 6.283185307 ≈\n\n1.6735575 * 6.283185307 ≈ 10.517 (since 1.6735 * 6 = 10.041, 1.6735 * 0.283 ≈ 0.474, total ≈ 10.515)\n\nSo 10.515e-27 ≈ 1.0515e-26\n\nThen multiply by 1.380649e-23:\n\n1.0515e-26 * 1.380649e-23 ≈ 1.0515 * 1.380649e-49 ≈ 1.452e-49\n\nSo denominator is 1.452e-49 J kg / K (units might be messy, but the numerical value is 1.452e-49)\n\nThen T = 2.744e-48 / 1.452e-49 ≈ (2.744 / 1.452) * 10^( -48 + 49 ) ≈ 1.89 * 10^1 ≈ 18.9 K\n\nSo approximately 18.9 K, which is about 19 K. So the answer is approximately 19 K. Depending on rounding, maybe 20 K. But since the problem says \"numerical estimate\", 20 K is acceptable. Alternatively, if precise, 19 K. Let me check if the original potential range was given as approximately 4 Å, so maybe the answer should be an order of magnitude. But 19 K is already a precise number. However, in exams, sometimes such estimates are given to one significant figure, so 20 K. But the exact calculation gives ~19 K. Let me see if there's a standard expression for this.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the criterion is that the thermal wavelength λ should be larger than the interaction range a, so the temperature T is given by k_B T ≈ h²/(2 m a²). Let's check this.\n\nIf we set (h²)/(2 m a²) ≈ k_B T, then T ≈ h²/(2 m a² k_B)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J s\n\nm = 1.67e-27 kg\n\na = 4e-10 m\n\nk_B = 1.38e-23 J/K\n\nCompute h²: (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s²\n\nDenominator: 2 * m * a² * k_B = 2 * 1.67e-27 kg * (4e-10 m)^2 * 1.38e-23 J/K\n\nCompute a²: (4e-10)^2 = 16e-20 m²\n\nSo denominator: 2 * 1.67e-27 * 16e-20 * 1.38e-23 = 2 * 1.67 * 16 * 1.38 * 1e-27-20-23 = 2 * 1.67*16*1.38 * 1e-70\n\nCompute 1.67*16 = 26.72\n\n26.72 * 1.38 ≈ 26.72 * 1 + 26.72 * 0.38 ≈ 26.72 + 10.15 ≈ 36.87\n\nThen 2 * 36.87 ≈ 73.74\n\nSo denominator ≈ 73.74e-70 ≈ 7.374e-69\n\nTherefore, T ≈ 4.39e-67 / 7.374e-69 ≈ (4.39 / 7.374) * 10^( -67 + 69 ) ≈ 0.595 * 100 ≈ 59.5 K\n\nWait, that's different. So using this formula gives about 60 K. But this contradicts the previous result. Hmm, why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, the two different approaches: one using thermal de Broglie wavelength λ = h / sqrt(2 π m k_B T), setting λ ≈ a, leading to T ≈ h²/(2 π m k_B a²), which gave ~19 K. The other approach, setting k_B T ≈ h²/(2 m a²), gives T ≈ h²/(2 m a² k_B) ≈ 60 K. So which one is correct?\n\nI think the correct criterion is that the thermal wavelength λ_th is comparable to the interaction range a. The thermal wavelength λ_th is given by h / sqrt(2 π m k_B T). So setting λ_th ≈ a gives T ≈ h²/(2 π m k_B a²). Which is the first approach, leading to ~19 K. \n\nThe second approach assumes that the thermal energy k_B T is comparable to the energy scale associated with the potential range, which is h²/(2 m a²). But this might be a different criterion. So which one is appropriate for determining when s-wave scattering dominates?\n\nI think the first approach is correct. Because s-wave scattering dominates when the de Broglie wavelength is large compared to the range of the potential. The thermal de Broglie wavelength being larger than the potential range implies that the particles' wavefunctions are spread out enough that they don't probe the short-range details, hence higher angular momentum partial waves are negligible. \n\nTherefore, the correct temperature should be around 19 K. However, the second approach gives a higher temperature. So why the difference? Let's see:\n\nFirst approach: T ≈ h²/(2 π m k_B a²) ≈ (6.626e-34)^2 / (2 * π * 1.67e-27 * 1.38e-23 * (4e-10)^2 )\n\nCompute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67\n\nDenominator: 2 * π * 1.67e-27 * 1.38e-23 * 16e-20 ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 1.67 * 1.38 * 16 * 1e-27-23-20 ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 1.67 * 1.38 * 16 * 1e-70\n\nCompute constants:\n\n2 * 3.1416 ≈ 6.2832\n\n1.67 * 1.38 ≈ 2.3046\n\n2.3046 * 16 ≈ 36.874\n\n6.2832 * 36.874 ≈ 231.7\n\nSo denominator ≈ 231.7e-70 ≈ 2.317e-68\n\nThus T ≈ 4.39e-67 / 2.317e-68 ≈ 4.39 / 2.317 * 10^( -67 + 68 ) ≈ 1.895 * 10^1 ≈ 18.95 K, which matches the previous result.\n\nThe second approach, which equates k_B T to h²/(2 m a²), gives T ≈ h²/(2 m a² k_B) ≈ (6.626e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.67e-27 * (4e-10)^2 * 1.38e-23 )\n\nCompute numerator: same as before, 4.39e-67\n\nDenominator: 2 * 1.67e-27 * 16e-20 * 1.38e-23 ≈ 2 * 1.67 * 16 * 1.38 * 1e-27-20-23 ≈ 2 * 1.67*16*1.38 * 1e-70\n\n1.67*16 = 26.72\n\n26.72*1.38 ≈ 36.87\n\n2*36.87 ≈73.74\n\nDenominator ≈73.74e-70 ≈7.374e-69\n\nThus T ≈4.39e-67 /7.374e-69 ≈4.39/7.374 *1e2 ≈0.595*100≈59.5 K\n\nSo this gives ~60 K. But why the discrepancy?\n\nThe difference is a factor of π in the denominator. The first approach includes a factor of 2 π in the thermal wavelength formula, while the second approach does not. Therefore, the correct formula to use is the one involving the thermal de Broglie wavelength, which includes the 2 π factor, leading to ~19 K. \n\nThe confusion arises because different sources might define the thermal wavelength with or without the 2 π factor. For example, in the context of the ideal gas, the thermal wavelength is often defined as h / sqrt(2 π m k_B T), which comes from the partition function. Therefore, using this definition, the correct temperature is ~19 K. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 20 K when rounded, but the precise calculation gives ~19 K. Since the problem asks for a numerical estimate, either 20 K or 19 K is acceptable. However, given that constants have some approximations (e.g., mass of hydrogen, the exact value of the range), 20 K is a reasonable estimate. But the precise calculation gives ~19 K, so I should go with that.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the temperature below which atom-atom scattering is essentially s-wave, we compare the thermal de Broglie wavelength \\( \\lambda_{\\text{th}} \\) to the range of the potential (4 Å). S-wave scattering dominates when \\( \\lambda_{\\text{th}} \\) is much larger than the potential range. The thermal de Broglie wavelength is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi m k_B T}}\n\\]\n\nSetting \\( \\lambda_{\\text{th}} \\approx 4 \\, \\text{Å} = 4 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m} \\), we solve for \\( T \\):\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m} = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J s}}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi (1.67 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\text{kg}) (1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J/K}) T}}\n\\]\n\nRearranging and solving for \\( T \\):\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{h^2}{2 \\pi m k_B (4 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m})^2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting constants:\n- \\( h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J s} \\)\n- \\( m = 1.67 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n- \\( k_B = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J/K} \\)\n- \\( a = 4 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m} \\)\n\nCalculations yield:\n\n\\[\nT \\approx 19 \\, \\text{K}\n\\]\n\nThus, the temperature below which s-wave scattering dominates is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{20 \\, \\text{K}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["20 \\text{ K}", "20 \\text{ K}", "20 \\, \\text{K}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "20 \\text{ K}", "expr2": "T \\leq 1 \\, \\text{K}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "20 \\text{ K}", "expr2": "T \\leq 1 \\, \\text{K}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "20 \\, \\text{K}", "expr2": "T \\leq 1 \\, \\text{K}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/2-36", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The problem gives a modified semiempirical mass formula for nuclear binding energy that includes an eccentricity term ε. The question asks to interpret the equation and find a limiting condition involving Z and A for prompt spontaneous fission, using Plutonium-240 as an example.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the standard semiempirical mass formula (SEMF). The usual terms are volume, surface, Coulomb, asymmetry, and pairing. Here, the given formula seems to modify the surface and Coulomb terms with an eccentricity ε. The surface term is proportional to A^(2/3) and is increased by a factor (1 + 2/5 ε²), while the Coulomb term, proportional to Z²/A^(1/3), is decreased by (1 - 1/5 ε²). \n\nSpontaneous fission occurs when the nucleus becomes unstable to deformation, leading to a split into two daughter nuclei. For spontaneous fission to be prompt, the nucleus must be in a state where any small deformation (non-zero ε) leads to a decrease in the binding energy, making the deformation energetically favorable. This would mean that the binding energy B decreases as ε increases from zero. So, the condition would be that the derivative of B with respect to ε² at ε=0 is negative. Wait, maybe we need to look at the second derivative or the sign of the coefficient of ε² in the expansion of B. Let me think.\n\nThe binding energy is given as:\n\nB = αA - βA^(2/3)(1 + (2/5)ε²) - γZ²A^(-1/3)(1 - (1/5)ε²)\n\nIf we expand this around ε=0, the terms involving ε² will determine the stability. The idea is that if the coefficient of ε² is negative, then increasing ε² (deforming the nucleus) lowers the binding energy, making the deformation favorable. So, the condition for instability (spontaneous fission) is that the coefficient of ε² in B is negative.\n\nLet's compute the coefficient of ε². Let's write B as:\n\nB = [αA - βA^(2/3) - γZ²A^(-1/3)] + ε² [ -βA^(2/3)*(2/5) + γZ²A^(-1/3)*(1/5) ]\n\nSo the coefficient of ε² is:\n\n(1/5)γZ²A^(-1/3) - (2/5)βA^(2/3)\n\nFor spontaneous fission to be possible, this coefficient must be negative. Therefore:\n\n(1/5)γZ²A^(-1/3) - (2/5)βA^(2/3) < 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 to eliminate denominators:\n\nγZ²A^(-1/3) - 2βA^(2/3) < 0\n\nRearranged:\n\nγZ²A^(-1/3) < 2βA^(2/3)\n\nMultiply both sides by A^(1/3):\n\nγZ² < 2βA\n\nSo:\n\nZ²/A < 2β/(γ)\n\nGiven that β =13 MeV and γ=0.6 MeV, substituting:\n\nZ²/A < (2*13)/0.6 = 26 / 0.6 ≈ 43.333...\n\nSo the condition is Z²/A < 43.33. If this is satisfied, then the coefficient of ε² is negative, meaning that increasing ε decreases the binding energy, leading to instability against deformation (spontaneous fission).\n\nFor Plutonium-240, Z=94, A=240. Let's compute Z²/A:\n\n94² / 240 = (8836)/240 ≈ 36.8167\n\nWhich is less than 43.33. Wait, but that would mean the condition is satisfied, so the coefficient of ε² is negative, implying that the nucleus is unstable to deformation. But Plutonium-240 does undergo spontaneous fission, but maybe this is a simplified model. However, the actual condition for spontaneous fission might require a certain critical value. Wait, perhaps the condition here is that when Z²/A exceeds a certain value, spontaneous fission is possible. Wait, but according to the calculation, if Z²/A is less than 43.33, then the coefficient is negative. But in reality, higher Z²/A (more protons relative to A) would lead to higher Coulomb repulsion, making fission more likely. So maybe the condition here is that when Z²/A exceeds 43.33, the nucleus is stable against spontaneous fission? Wait, no, because the coefficient being negative would mean that increasing ε lowers the energy, making deformation favorable. So if Z²/A is less than 43.33, then the coefficient is negative, leading to instability. But in reality, higher Z²/A (like for heavy nuclei) would lead to higher Coulomb repulsion, hence more likely to fission. So perhaps there's a contradiction here. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the inequality.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the steps. The coefficient of ε² is (1/5 γ Z² A^{-1/3} - 2/5 β A^{2/3}). For this to be negative:\n\n(1/5 γ Z² A^{-1/3}) < (2/5 β A^{2/3})\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\nγ Z² A^{-1/3} < 2 β A^{2/3}\n\nMultiply both sides by A^{1/3}:\n\nγ Z² < 2 β A\n\nThen:\n\nZ²/A < (2 β)/(γ)\n\nSo substituting the given values β=13, γ=0.6:\n\nZ²/A < (2*13)/0.6 = 26/0.6 ≈ 43.333...\n\nSo if Z²/A is less than ~43.33, then the coefficient is negative, leading to instability. But Plutonium-240 has Z=94, A=240, so Z²/A = 94² /240 ≈ 8836 /240 ≈ 36.82, which is less than 43.33, so according to this model, it would be unstable. But in reality, Pu-240 does undergo spontaneous fission, but perhaps in the model, this condition is the threshold. Wait, but maybe the actual condition is that when Z²/A exceeds a certain value, the nucleus is unstable. There's a confusion here. Let me check standard spontaneous fission conditions.\n\nIn the standard liquid drop model, the fissility parameter is given by Z²/(A), and when this exceeds a certain value (around 45-50), the nucleus becomes unstable to spontaneous fission. For example, the critical fissility parameter is around 45. So if Z²/A > ~45, then spontaneous fission is possible. But according to our calculation here, the condition is Z²/A < 43.33. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the model here is different because of the eccentricity terms. Let me think again.\n\nIn the given formula, the Coulomb term is modified by (1 - ε²/5), so increasing ε reduces the Coulomb energy. The surface term is increased by (1 + 2ε²/5), so increasing ε increases the surface energy (which is a negative term in the binding energy, so increasing surface energy makes the binding energy less negative, i.e., less bound). So the total effect of ε is that increasing ε makes the surface term less binding and the Coulomb term more binding. Wait, but the Coulomb term is subtracted, so if the Coulomb term is multiplied by (1 - ε²/5), then the actual Coulomb energy (which is subtracted) becomes smaller in magnitude when ε increases, meaning the total binding energy becomes more negative (more binding) if Coulomb term is smaller. Wait, no: the Coulomb term is -γ Z² A^{-1/3} (1 - ε²/5). So if ε increases, the Coulomb term becomes less negative (since (1 - ε²/5) decreases), so the total binding energy increases (less negative). Wait, but binding energy is usually defined as positive when the nucleus is bound. Wait, the formula here is written as B = ... So higher B means more binding. Let me check the formula again.\n\nThe formula is written as B = α A - β A^{2/3}(1 + 2/5 ε²) - γ Z² A^{-1/3}(1 - 1/5 ε²). So each term is positive, and B is the binding energy. The surface term (second term) is subtracted, so increasing ε increases the surface term's subtraction, making B smaller. The Coulomb term (third term) is also subtracted, but increasing ε decreases the Coulomb term's subtraction (because (1 - 1/5 ε²) becomes smaller as ε increases), so the Coulomb term's contribution to B is less subtracted, making B larger. So the effect of ε is two-fold: increasing surface term subtraction (bad for B) and decreasing Coulomb term subtraction (good for B). The net effect on B is the combination of these two.\n\nThe coefficient of ε² in B is then:\n\nFrom surface term: -β A^{2/3}*(2/5)\n\nFrom Coulomb term: + γ Z² A^{-1/3}*(1/5)\n\nSo total coefficient: (1/5 γ Z² A^{-1/3} - 2/5 β A^{2/3})\n\nIf this coefficient is positive, then increasing ε² increases B (more binding), which would stabilize the nucleus against deformation. If it's negative, increasing ε² decreases B, making deformation favorable (less binding), leading to instability. Therefore, the condition for instability (spontaneous fission) is that this coefficient is negative, which gives:\n\n(1/5 γ Z² A^{-1/3} - 2/5 β A^{2/3}) < 0\n\nMultiply by 5:\n\nγ Z² A^{-1/3} - 2 β A^{2/3} < 0\n\nMultiply both sides by A^{1/3}:\n\nγ Z² - 2 β A < 0\n\nSo:\n\nγ Z² < 2 β A\n\nWhich rearranges to:\n\nZ²/A < (2 β)/γ\n\nPlugging in the given values β=13 MeV, γ=0.6 MeV:\n\nZ²/A < (2*13)/0.6 ≈ 43.333...\n\nSo when Z²/A is less than approximately 43.33, the nucleus is unstable to deformation (spontaneous fission). But in reality, higher Z²/A (more protons relative to mass number) leads to higher Coulomb repulsion and thus higher tendency for fission. So there's a discrepancy here. Wait, perhaps the model here is inverted. Let me check with actual values.\n\nTake Uranium-238: Z=92, A=238. Z²/A ≈ 92²/238 ≈ 8464/238 ≈ 35.56, which is less than 43.33. According to the model, it should be unstable. But U-238 does undergo spontaneous fission, but it's a rare process; its primary decay mode is alpha decay. Similarly, Pu-240 has Z²/A ≈ 36.8, which is less than 43.33, so according to the model, it's unstable. But in reality, spontaneous fission is a possible decay mode but not the dominant one. So perhaps the model here is a simplified version where when Z²/A exceeds 43.33, the nucleus is stable against spontaneous fission, and below that, it's unstable. But that contradicts the standard fissility parameter where higher Z²/A implies higher tendency for fission. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the inequality.\n\nWait, let's re-express the condition. The coefficient of ε² is (γ Z²)/(5 A^{1/3}) - (2 β A^{2/3})/5. For this to be negative:\n\n(γ Z²)/(5 A^{1/3}) < (2 β A^{2/3})/5\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\nγ Z² / A^{1/3} < 2 β A^{2/3}\n\nMultiply both sides by A^{1/3}:\n\nγ Z² < 2 β A\n\nSo:\n\nZ²/A < (2 β)/γ\n\nGiven β=13, γ=0.6:\n\nZ²/A < 26/0.6 ≈43.33\n\nSo if Z²/A is less than 43.33, then the coefficient is negative, leading to instability. But in reality, higher Z²/A (more charged nucleus) should be more prone to fission. So this model seems to suggest the opposite. Maybe the model is considering that when the Coulomb term is strong enough, the nucleus is more stable against deformation? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the model is considering that when the surface energy penalty for deformation is outweighed by the Coulomb energy gain, leading to instability. Let's think physically.\n\nThe surface term increases with deformation (higher surface area, hence higher surface energy, which in the SEMF is a term that reduces binding energy). The Coulomb term decreases with deformation (if the nucleus elongates, the protons are further apart, reducing Coulomb repulsion, hence the Coulomb term becomes less negative, increasing binding energy). So the competition is between the surface energy (which resists deformation) and Coulomb energy (which favors deformation). If the Coulomb term's gain (i.e., reduction in Coulomb energy subtraction) is larger than the surface term's loss (increase in surface energy subtraction), then the net effect is that deformation lowers the total binding energy (i.e., the nucleus becomes less bound, which is unfavorable). Wait, no: if deformation causes B to decrease (less binding), that's unfavorable. Wait, but in the formula, B is the binding energy. If B decreases, the nucleus is less bound, so it's more likely to undergo fission. Wait, but actually, fission is a process where the nucleus splits into two, which is more bound (higher binding energy). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, when the nucleus deforms, the binding energy changes. If the binding energy decreases (B becomes smaller), that means the deformed state is less stable than the original, so the deformation is not favored. But if the binding energy increases (B becomes larger) upon deformation, the deformed state is more stable, so the nucleus will tend to deform further, leading to fission.\n\nWait, no. Binding energy is the energy released when forming the nucleus. A higher binding energy means more stable. If deforming the nucleus (increasing ε) leads to a higher B, then the nucleus is more stable when deformed, so it will tend to deform further, leading to fission. Conversely, if deforming leads to lower B, the nucleus is less stable when deformed, so it resists deformation.\n\nBut according to the given formula, when the coefficient of ε² is positive, then B increases with ε², so deformation is favored. If the coefficient is negative, B decreases with ε², so deformation is not favored. Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nThe binding energy B is given by:\n\nB = ... - [terms with ε²]\n\nIf the coefficient of ε² is positive, then increasing ε² increases B (more binding), so the nucleus becomes more stable when deformed, leading to spontaneous deformation (fission). If the coefficient is negative, increasing ε² decreases B, making the nucleus less stable when deformed, so it resists deformation.\n\nWait, no. Let's take the expression for B:\n\nB(ε) = B0 + C * ε²\n\nWhere B0 is the binding energy at ε=0, and C is the coefficient we calculated.\n\nIf C is positive, then B increases with ε², so the nucleus is more bound (more stable) when deformed. This would mean that the nucleus will tend to deform spontaneously to lower its energy, leading to fission. If C is negative, then deforming the nucleus (increasing ε) lowers B, making it less stable, so the nucleus prefers to stay spherical.\n\nTherefore, the condition for spontaneous fission (instability) is that C > 0. Wait, but earlier we found that the coefficient C is (1/5 γ Z² A^{-1/3} - 2/5 β A^{2/3}). So if C > 0, then B increases with ε², leading to spontaneous deformation. Therefore, the condition for instability is C > 0, which would be:\n\n(1/5 γ Z² A^{-1/3} - 2/5 β A^{2/3}) > 0\n\nMultiply by 5:\n\nγ Z² A^{-1/3} - 2 β A^{2/3} > 0\n\nMultiply by A^{1/3}:\n\nγ Z² - 2 β A > 0\n\nSo:\n\nZ²/A > (2 β)/γ\n\nAh! Here's the mistake. Earlier, I thought the condition was C < 0, but actually, if C > 0, then increasing ε increases B, leading to instability. Therefore, the correct condition is Z²/A > (2 β)/γ.\n\nGiven β=13, γ=0.6:\n\n(2*13)/0.6 = 26/0.6 ≈43.333...\n\nSo when Z²/A > 43.33, the nucleus is unstable to spontaneous fission. This aligns with the standard fissility parameter where higher Z²/A implies higher tendency for fission. For example, for Z²/A > ~45, nuclei are more prone to fission. So in this model, the critical value is ~43.33. Therefore, the limiting condition is Z²/A > (2β)/γ.\n\nFor part (a), the answer is that the limiting condition is Z²/A > (2β)/γ, which evaluates to Z²/A > 43.33. For Pu-240, Z²/A ≈36.8, which is less than 43.33, so according to this model, it's below the threshold and thus stable against spontaneous fission. But in reality, Pu-240 does undergo spontaneous fission, albeit with a low probability. This discrepancy suggests that the model might be simplified and doesn't account for other factors like shell effects or the potential barrier. However, the question asks for the condition based on the given formula, so we proceed with the derived condition.\n\nNow, part (b) discusses fission shape isomers and spontaneous fission from ground states, implying a more complex potential energy function V(ε). The question asks about simple nuclear excitations accounting for two sets of states in Pu-240, similarities/differences, implications for V(ε), and to sketch V(ε).\n\nFission shape isomers are metastable states where the nucleus is deformed but trapped in a potential minimum. The ground state is usually spherical or slightly deformed, but there can be a second minimum in the potential energy curve at a larger deformation (ε). These two minima correspond to the ground state and the shape isomer. The two sets of states likely refer to states in the first (ground state) minimum and the second (isomeric) minimum.\n\nSimilarities: Both sets of states are quantized nuclear states with specific energy levels. Differences: The shape isomer has a much larger deformation, leading to different moments of inertia and thus different rotational band structures. The potential barrier between the two minima allows the shape isomer to exist for a measurable time before fissioning.\n\nImplications for V(ε): The potential energy function V(ε) must have two minima—one at small ε (ground state) and another at larger ε (shape isomer)—separated by a potential barrier. At ε=0 (spherical), there's the ground state minimum. As ε increases, V(ε) rises to a maximum (barrier), then decreases into a second minimum at higher ε. Beyond the second minimum, V(ε) might decrease further, leading to fission.\n\nA rough sketch would show V(ε) starting at a minimum at ε=0, rising to a peak (barrier), then dipping into a second minimum at some ε >0, and then decreasing for larger ε (towards fission). This double-humped potential explains the existence of shape isomers in the second well.\n</think>\n\n(a) The modified semiempirical mass formula accounts for nuclear deformation via eccentricity \\(\\varepsilon\\). The surface term increases with \\(\\varepsilon^2\\), reducing binding energy, while the Coulomb term decreases with \\(\\varepsilon^2\\), increasing binding energy. For spontaneous fission to occur, the nucleus must be unstable to deformation, meaning the coefficient of \\(\\varepsilon^2\\) in \\(B\\) must be positive. This leads to the condition:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Z^2}{A} > \\frac{2\\beta}{\\gamma} \\approx 43.33 \\quad \\text{(using \\(\\beta = 13\\) MeV, \\(\\gamma = 0.6\\) MeV)}.\n\\]\n\nFor \\(^{240}_{94}\\text{Pu}\\), \\(\\frac{Z^2}{A} \\approx 36.8\\), which is below the threshold, suggesting stability against prompt fission in this model. However, real-world spontaneous fission in Pu-240 arises from quantum tunneling and other effects not captured here.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{Z^2}{A} > \\frac{2\\beta}{\\gamma}}\n\\]\n\n(b) The two sets of states in \\(^{240}_{94}\\text{Pu}\\) correspond to the ground state (small \\(\\varepsilon\\)) and a fission shape isomer (large \\(\\varepsilon\\)). **Similarities**: Both states are quantized nuclear configurations. **Differences**: The isomer has a highly deformed shape, distinct rotational bands, and a longer fission pathway. The potential \\(V(\\varepsilon)\\) exhibits a double-humped structure: a primary minimum at \\(\\varepsilon = 0\\), a barrier at intermediate \\(\\varepsilon\\), and a secondary minimum at large \\(\\varepsilon\\) (shape isomer). Beyond the secondary minimum, \\(V(\\varepsilon)\\) decreases, leading to fission. This explains metastable isomers and spontaneous fission from the ground state via tunneling.\n\n**Sketch of \\(V(\\varepsilon)\\)**:  \n- Minimum at \\(\\varepsilon = 0\\) (ground state).  \n- Rises to a local maximum (barrier).  \n- Dips into a secondary minimum (shape isomer).  \n- Decreases monotonically for \\(\\varepsilon > \\varepsilon_{\\text{isomer}}\\) (fission path).  \n\nThe double-humped potential implies competing energy contributions: surface tension stabilizes the ground state, while Coulomb repulsion drives deformation.", "final_answers": ["\\frac{Z^2}{A} > \\frac{2\\beta}{\\gamma}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{Z^2}{A} > \\frac{2\\beta}{\\gamma}", "expr2": "\\frac{Z^2}{A} \\geq 43.3"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "2*beta/gamma < Z**2/A", "expr2": "Z**2/A >= 43.3"}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": "unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'StrictLessThan' and 'GreaterThan'"}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{Z^2}{A} > \\frac{2\\beta}{\\gamma}", "expr2": "\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2J} \\approx 7 \\text{ MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{Z^2}{A} > \\frac{2\\beta}{\\gamma}", "expr2": "\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2J} \\approx 3.3 \\text{ MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-18", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the typical lifetime of an excited atom. The options given are 10^-1, 10^-8, 10^-13, and 10^-23 seconds. Hmm, let me recall what I know about atomic transitions and excited states.\n\nFirst, atoms get excited when their electrons absorb energy and jump to higher energy levels. These excited states are temporary, and the electrons eventually return to lower energy levels, emitting photons in the process. The time they stay in these excited states is called the lifetime of the excited state.\n\nI remember that for electronic transitions in atoms, especially the ones that result in visible or ultraviolet light emission, the typical lifetimes are on the order of nanoseconds. Wait, a nanosecond is 10^-9 seconds. But the options here are 10^-8, which is 10 nanoseconds, and 10^-13, which is much shorter. Then there's 10^-1, which is a tenth of a second, way longer, and 10^-23, which is extremely short, like the timescale of nuclear reactions maybe?\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up different types of transitions. Let me think. The lifetime depends on the type of transition. Electric dipole transitions are the most common, and their lifetimes are around 10^-8 to 10^-9 seconds. But if the transition is forbidden, like a magnetic dipole or electric quadrupole, the lifetime can be much longer. For example, some metastable states can last milliseconds or even seconds, but those are exceptions, not typical.\n\nSo the question is about the \"typical\" lifetime. So the answer should be 10^-8 seconds. But wait, why isn't 10^-9 there? The options given are 10^-1, 10^-8, 10^-13, 10^-23. So 10^-8 is the closest. But maybe I should verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm confusing spontaneous emission rates. The Einstein A coefficient is the inverse of the lifetime. For electric dipole transitions, A is about 10^8 s^-1, so the lifetime is about 10^-8 seconds. That matches. So yes, 10^-8 seconds is the typical lifetime for an excited atom undergoing an electric dipole transition, which is the most common case.\n\nThe other options: 10^-1 seconds is way too long unless it's a metastable state, which isn't typical. 10^-13 seconds is more like vibrational or rotational transitions in molecules, maybe? Or perhaps nuclear energy levels, but atoms' electronic transitions are slower. 10^-23 seconds is way too fast, that's the timescale of strong interactions or particle decays, not atomic transitions.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 10^-8 seconds.\n</think>\n\nThe typical lifetime of an excited atom depends on the type of transition. For common electric dipole transitions, the lifetime is governed by the Einstein A coefficient, which corresponds to a timescale of approximately \\(10^{-8}\\) seconds. This aligns with the majority of atomic transitions in the visible or ultraviolet range. Longer lifetimes (e.g., \\(10^{-1}\\) seconds) are atypical and associated with metastable states, while shorter lifetimes like \\(10^{-13}\\) or \\(10^{-23}\\) seconds pertain to molecular vibrations or nuclear processes, respectively. Thus, the most representative value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10^{-8}\\ \\text{sec}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["10^{-8}\\ \\text{sec}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "10^{-8}\\ \\text{sec}", "expr2": "10^{-8} \\, \\text{s}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/2-38", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to estimate the ratio of the energy released when 1 gram of uranium undergoes fission compared to 1 gram of TNT exploding. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about energy release in both processes. \n\nFirst, nuclear fission. Uranium-235, when it undergoes fission, releases a lot of energy. I remember that each fission event releases around 200 MeV (mega-electron volts) of energy. But wait, I need to convert that into a more usable unit, like joules, to compare with TNT's energy. \n\nLet me think. One electron volt is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So 200 MeV would be 200 million eV. So 200 x 10^6 eV. Multiply that by 1.602e-19 J/eV. Let me calculate that: 200e6 * 1.602e-19 = 3.204e-11 J per fission event. \n\nBut how many atoms are in 1 gram of uranium-235? To find that, I need Avogadro's number, which is 6.022e23 atoms per mole. The molar mass of U-235 is 235 grams per mole. So 1 gram would be 1/235 moles. Therefore, the number of atoms is (1/235) * 6.022e23 ≈ 6.022e23 / 235 ≈ 2.56e21 atoms. \n\nBut not all of these atoms undergo fission. Wait, the question says \"when 1 g of uranium undergoes fission,\" so maybe assuming all of it undergoes fission? Because in reality, in a nuclear bomb or reactor, not all of it fissions, but the question says \"undergoes fission,\" so perhaps we can assume 100% efficiency here. \n\nSo total energy from uranium would be number of atoms times energy per fission. So 2.56e21 atoms * 3.204e-11 J/atom. Let me compute that: 2.56e21 * 3.204e-11 = (2.56 * 3.204) x 10^(21-11) = 8.202e10 J. So approximately 8.2e10 joules. \n\nNow, TNT. The energy released by TNT is a chemical reaction, so much less than nuclear reactions. I recall that 1 gram of TNT releases about 4184 joules (since 1 kiloton of TNT is roughly 4.184e12 joules, and 1 ton is 1e6 grams, so 1 gram would be 4.184e12 / 1e6 = 4.184e6 J? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1 ton of TNT is 1e6 grams, so 1 kiloton is 1e9 grams. Then 1 kiloton TNT = 4.184e12 J. Therefore, 1 gram of TNT is 4.184e12 J / 1e9 grams = 4.184e3 J per gram. So 4184 J/g. Yeah, that's right. So 1 gram TNT is about 4.184e3 J. \n\nSo the ratio would be energy from uranium divided by energy from TNT. So 8.2e10 J / 4.184e3 J/g. Wait, but both are per gram. So the ratio is (8.2e10) / (4.184e3) ≈ (8.2 / 4.184) x 10^(10-3) ≈ approximately 2 x 10^7. Wait, 8.2 divided by 4.184 is roughly 2. So 2e7. So the ratio is about 10^7. \n\nBut wait, let me check the numbers again. Let's do the exact calculation. \n\nUranium energy: 2.56e21 atoms * 3.204e-11 J/atom = 2.56 * 3.204 = 8.202, so 8.202e10 J. \n\nTNT energy: 4.184e3 J/g. \n\nSo ratio: 8.202e10 / 4.184e3 ≈ (8.202 / 4.184) * 10^(10-3) ≈ 1.96 * 10^7 ≈ 2e7. So the ratio is approximately 2 x 10^7. But the question says order of magnitude, so 10^7. \n\nWait, but sometimes the energy per fission is approximated as 200 MeV, but maybe some sources use 200 MeV per fission, but maybe considering that each fission actually releases more energy because of the decay products? Wait, no, the prompt energy from fission is around 200 MeV. But maybe some sources use 200 MeV per fission. Let me confirm. \n\nYes, typically, each U-235 fission releases about 200 MeV of energy. So that part is correct. \n\nAvogadro's number is 6.022e23. Molar mass 235 g/mol. So 1 gram is 1/235 mol. So atoms = 6.022e23 / 235 ≈ 2.56e21. Correct. \n\nEnergy per gram U-235: 2.56e21 * 200 MeV. Wait, but earlier I converted 200 MeV to joules. Let me check that again. \n\n200 MeV = 200e6 eV. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 200e6 * 1.602e-19 = 3.204e-11 J per fission. Correct. \n\nSo 2.56e21 * 3.204e-11 = 8.2e10 J. \n\nTNT: 1 gram is 4184 J. \n\nSo 8.2e10 / 4.184e3 ≈ 1.96e7. So approximately 2e7. But order of magnitude is 10^7. \n\nSo the ratio is on the order of 10^7. \n\nBut wait, sometimes TNT's energy is approximated as 4.2e3 J/g, so that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the ratio is approximately 10^7. So the answer is 10^7, so boxed as \\boxed{10^7}.\n</think>\n\nTo estimate the ratio of the energy released when 1 g of uranium undergoes fission to the energy released when 1 g of TNT explodes:\n\n1. **Energy from Uranium Fission:**\n   - Each fission of uranium-235 releases approximately \\(200 \\text{ MeV}\\).\n   - Convert \\(200 \\text{ MeV}\\) to joules:  \n     \\[\n     200 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV} \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J/eV} = 3.204 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ J/fission}\n     \\]\n   - Number of uranium atoms in 1 g:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{1 \\text{ g}}{235 \\text{ g/mol}} \\times 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ atoms/mol} \\approx 2.56 \\times 10^{21} \\text{ atoms}\n     \\]\n   - Total energy from 1 g of uranium:  \n     \\[\n     2.56 \\times 10^{21} \\text{ atoms} \\times 3.204 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ J/atom} \\approx 8.2 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ J}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Energy from TNT Explosion:**\n   - Energy released by 1 g of TNT:  \n     \\[\n     4.184 \\times 10^3 \\text{ J/g}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Ratio Calculation:**\n   - Ratio of energy released:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{8.2 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ J}}{4.184 \\times 10^3 \\text{ J/g}} \\approx 1.96 \\times 10^7\n     \\]\n   - Order of magnitude: \\(10^7\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10^7}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["10^7", "10^7"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "10^7", "expr2": "2 \\times 10^7"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "10000000", "expr2": "20000000"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "10^7", "expr2": "2 \\times 10^7"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "10000000", "expr2": "20000000"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-20", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what happens when you swap the spatial coordinates of two electrons in a state with total spin 0. Let me start by recalling some basic quantum mechanics principles. \n\nFirst, electrons are fermions, which means they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Their overall wave function must be antisymmetric under the exchange of the particles. The overall wave function is a product of the spatial part and the spin part. So, when you swap two electrons, both the spatial and spin parts contribute to the symmetry of the total wave function.\n\nThe problem states that the total spin is 0. A total spin of 0 corresponds to a singlet state. The singlet state is antisymmetric under exchange of the spins. Let me remember: the singlet spin state is (up down - down up)/√2, right? So if I swap the spins, the spin part changes sign. That means the spin wave function is antisymmetric.\n\nNow, the total wave function has to be antisymmetric. Since the spin part is antisymmetric, the spatial part must be symmetric to compensate. Because when you swap the electrons, the spin part gives a minus sign, and the spatial part must also give a minus sign when combined to make the total antisymmetric. Wait, no. Wait, the total wave function is the product of spatial and spin parts. So if the spin part is antisymmetric, the spatial part must be symmetric so that when you swap the particles, the spatial part doesn't change sign and the spin part does, resulting in the total wave function being antisymmetric. Let me check that again.\n\nIf you swap the two electrons, the spatial part ψ(r1, r2) becomes ψ(r2, r1), and the spin part χ(s1, s2) becomes χ(s2, s1). The total wave function is ψ(r1, r2)χ(s1, s2). For fermions, swapping must give -total wave function. So:\n\nψ(r2, r1)χ(s2, s1) = -ψ(r1, r2)χ(s1, s2)\n\nIf the spin part is antisymmetric, then χ(s2, s1) = -χ(s1, s2). So substituting that in:\n\nψ(r2, r1)(-χ(s1, s2)) = -ψ(r1, r2)χ(s1, s2)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nψ(r2, r1)χ(s1, s2) = ψ(r1, r2)χ(s1, s2)\n\nWhich implies ψ(r2, r1) = ψ(r1, r2). So the spatial part must be symmetric. Therefore, the spatial wave function is symmetric under exchange when the spin part is antisymmetric.\n\nNow, the question is: If we interchange the spatial coordinates of the two electrons, what happens to the wave function? The spatial part is symmetric, so swapping r1 and r2 leaves the spatial part unchanged. But wait, the question is about interchanging the spatial coordinates. So if the spatial wave function is symmetric, then swapping the coordinates doesn't change the spatial part. Therefore, the spatial part remains the same. But the spin part is antisymmetric. However, the question is only about interchanging the spatial coordinates. Wait, but when you swap the electrons, you swap both their spatial coordinates and their spins. But the problem here says \"interchanges the spatial coordinates of two electrons\". Does that mean we are only swapping their positions and not their spins? Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Because in reality, exchanging particles would swap both their positions and spins. But the question specifically says interchanging the spatial coordinates. So maybe we are only swapping their positions (r1 and r2) but leaving their spins as they are? Or does the spin get swapped as well?\n\nWait, the problem states: \"interchanges the spatial coordinates of two electrons in a state of total spin 0\". So perhaps the spin state is already fixed as the singlet (total spin 0), which is antisymmetric. So when we swap the spatial coordinates, we are performing an exchange of the particles' positions but keeping their spins the same? Or is the exchange operator P that swaps both position and spin?\n\nThis is a crucial point. The exchange operator for identical particles swaps all the coordinates, which includes both spatial and spin parts. But the question here is phrased as interchanging the spatial coordinates. So maybe they are only swapping the spatial coordinates and not the spin coordinates. But in reality, when you exchange two electrons, you swap all their coordinates. So perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous. But given that the total spin is 0, which is a spin singlet, which is antisymmetric under exchange of spins. So if we swap the spatial coordinates, perhaps the spin coordinates are also swapped. But the problem says \"interchanges the spatial coordinates\", so maybe the spin coordinates are not swapped. Wait, but electrons are identical particles, so exchanging them would swap all their coordinates. However, the problem might be considering a scenario where only the spatial parts are swapped. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using \"interchanging the spatial coordinates\" as a way to refer to exchanging the particles, which would swap both spatial and spin coordinates. But given that the spin state is already given as total spin 0, which is antisymmetric, then the spatial part must be symmetric. Therefore, swapping both spatial and spin coordinates would result in the total wave function being antisymmetric. But the question is about swapping the spatial coordinates. If the spin coordinates are not swapped, then the effect would be different. But I think the standard exchange operator swaps both spatial and spin coordinates. However, the problem's wording is a bit unclear. Let me think again.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, when you exchange two identical particles, you exchange all their coordinates: position, spin, etc. So the exchange operator P swaps both spatial and spin coordinates. Therefore, the total wave function must be antisymmetric under P. But in this problem, the total spin is 0, so the spin part is antisymmetric, and the spatial part is symmetric. Therefore, under the exchange operator P (swapping both spatial and spin), the spatial part remains the same (symmetric) and the spin part changes sign (antisymmetric), so the total wave function changes sign. But the question is about interchanging the spatial coordinates. If that means only swapping the spatial coordinates and not the spin coordinates, then the effect would be different. But that's not the usual exchange. So perhaps the problem is using \"interchanging the spatial coordinates\" as a shorthand for exchanging the particles, which includes spin. But given that the spin state is fixed as singlet, maybe the spin part is already accounted for. Wait, the problem says \"a state of total spin 0\". So the spin part is the singlet state. Therefore, the total wave function is the product of spatial and spin parts. The spin part is antisymmetric. Therefore, the spatial part must be symmetric. So when you exchange the particles (both spatial and spin coordinates), the spatial part is symmetric (doesn't change) and the spin part is antisymmetric (changes sign), so the total wave function changes sign. But the question is about interchanging the spatial coordinates. If we only swap the spatial coordinates and not the spin coordinates, then the effect would be different. Let me clarify.\n\nSuppose we have two electrons with coordinates (r1, s1) and (r2, s2). The exchange operator swaps both: (r2, s2) and (r1, s1). The total wave function must be antisymmetric under this exchange. However, the problem states that we interchange the spatial coordinates. If that means we swap r1 and r2 but leave the spins s1 and s2 as they are, then the spin part would not be swapped. But in reality, swapping the particles would swap both. So perhaps the problem is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that the spin state is already antisymmetric, so when you swap the spatial coordinates (without swapping spins), the effect on the total wave function would be... Hmm, but spins are part of the particles. If you swap the particles' positions but not their spins, that's not a full exchange. This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to approach it step by step.\n\nTotal wave function Ψ(r1, r2, s1, s2) = ψ(r1, r2) * χ(s1, s2)\n\nGiven that the total spin is 0, χ is the singlet state: χ(s1, s2) = (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2, which is antisymmetric under exchange of spins. So χ(s2, s1) = -χ(s1, s2).\n\nThe total wave function must be antisymmetric under exchange of both spatial and spin coordinates. So:\n\nΨ(r2, r1, s2, s1) = -Ψ(r1, r2, s1, s2)\n\nBut Ψ(r2, r1, s2, s1) = ψ(r2, r1) * χ(s2, s1) = ψ(r2, r1) * (-χ(s1, s2)) = -ψ(r2, r1) * χ(s1, s2)\n\nComparing to -Ψ(r1, r2, s1, s2) = -ψ(r1, r2) * χ(s1, s2)\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n-ψ(r2, r1) * χ(s1, s2) = -ψ(r1, r2) * χ(s1, s2)\n\nCanceling the negatives and χ(s1, s2) (assuming it's non-zero), we get ψ(r2, r1) = ψ(r1, r2). So the spatial part is symmetric.\n\nNow, the question is: If we interchange the spatial coordinates (i.e., swap r1 and r2), what happens to the wave function? The spatial part is symmetric, so ψ(r2, r1) = ψ(r1, r2). Therefore, the spatial part remains the same. However, the spin part is not being swapped here. Wait, but in this scenario, are we swapping the spins as well? The problem says \"interchanges the spatial coordinates of two electrons\". If we are only swapping their spatial coordinates (r1 and r2) but leaving their spins (s1 and s2) as they are, then the spin part remains the same. But the total wave function would then be ψ(r2, r1) * χ(s1, s2). Since ψ is symmetric, this is equal to ψ(r1, r2) * χ(s1, s2), which is the original wave function. Therefore, the wave function is unchanged. But wait, that can't be right because the total wave function must be antisymmetric under exchange of all coordinates. But in this case, we are not exchanging the spins. So this is a different operation. The problem is not performing a full exchange of the particles, but only swapping their spatial coordinates. Therefore, the answer would be (b) the wave function is unchanged, because the spatial part is symmetric and swapping spatial coordinates doesn't change it, and the spin part is not being swapped, so the total wave function remains the same. But wait, but the spin part is already antisymmetric. However, if we don't swap the spins, then the spin part remains as it is. So the total wave function after swapping only spatial coordinates would be ψ(r2, r1) * χ(s1, s2) = ψ(r1, r2) * χ(s1, s2) = original wave function. Therefore, the wave function is unchanged. So the answer would be (b). But wait, but the total wave function must be antisymmetric under exchange of all coordinates. However, the question is not performing a full exchange. It's only swapping the spatial coordinates. Therefore, the antisymmetry requirement doesn't apply here. The antisymmetry is required under the full exchange of both spatial and spin coordinates. If we only swap spatial coordinates, the wave function doesn't have to be antisymmetric under that operation. Therefore, since the spatial part is symmetric, swapping spatial coordinates leaves the wave function unchanged. Therefore, the answer is (b). But I need to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the exchange of the particles, which includes both spatial and spin coordinates. But since the spin part is already antisymmetric, swapping both would result in the total wave function changing sign. But the question specifically says \"interchanges the spatial coordinates\". If the spin coordinates are not swapped, then the wave function remains the same. But if the spin coordinates are swapped as part of the exchange, then the total wave function changes sign. But the problem states \"interchanges the spatial coordinates\", which might imply that only the spatial parts are swapped. However, in reality, when you swap two electrons, you swap all their coordinates. So perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous. But given that the spin state is fixed as singlet (total spin 0), which is antisymmetric, and the spatial part is symmetric, then swapping both spatial and spin coordinates would lead to the total wave function changing sign. But if the question is only swapping spatial coordinates, then the wave function remains the same. However, the problem might be using \"interchanging the spatial coordinates\" as a way to refer to exchanging the particles, which includes spin. In that case, the total wave function changes sign. But the answer options are (a) changes sign, (b) unchanged, (c) different function. \n\nWait, the problem says \"interchanges the spatial coordinates of two electrons\". So if you swap their positions but not their spins, then the spin part remains the same, and the spatial part is symmetric, so the total wave function is unchanged. But if swapping the spatial coordinates inherently includes swapping their spins (as part of the particle exchange), then the total wave function changes sign. But the wording is ambiguous. However, in standard quantum mechanics, the exchange of particles includes swapping all their coordinates. Therefore, the exchange operator swaps both spatial and spin coordinates. In that case, the total wave function must be antisymmetric. Given that the spin part is antisymmetric and the spatial part is symmetric, swapping both would result in the total wave function changing sign. Therefore, the answer would be (a). But the question specifically says \"interchanges the spatial coordinates\", which might mean only swapping the spatial parts. But in standard terminology, exchanging particles swaps all coordinates. Therefore, the answer should be (a) the wave function changes sign. But wait, let's check again. If the exchange is only spatial, then the spin part remains the same. The spatial part is symmetric, so swapping spatial coordinates leaves the spatial part unchanged. Therefore, the total wave function is unchanged. But this contradicts the antisymmetry requirement. Wait, no. The antisymmetry requirement is under the full exchange of all coordinates. If you only swap spatial coordinates, the wave function doesn't have to be antisymmetric under that operation. Therefore, the answer would be (b) the wave function is unchanged. But this seems conflicting. Let me think of an example. Suppose we have two electrons in a singlet spin state and symmetric spatial wave function. If we swap their positions (but not their spins), then the spatial part remains the same, and the spin part remains the same. Therefore, the total wave function is the same. But if we swap both their positions and spins, then the spatial part is symmetric (unchanged), the spin part is antisymmetric (changes sign), so the total wave function changes sign. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the swap includes spins or not. The question says \"interchanges the spatial coordinates\", which suggests only swapping positions, not spins. Therefore, the wave function is unchanged. Hence, answer (b). But I need to verify this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that when you swap the spatial coordinates, you are effectively swapping the particles, which includes their spins. In that case, the total wave function changes sign. But the problem states \"interchanges the spatial coordinates\", which might mean only the spatial part. This is a bit ambiguous, but in the context of quantum mechanics, when you exchange particles, you swap all their coordinates. However, the problem specifically mentions spatial coordinates, so perhaps it's only swapping the spatial part. Therefore, the answer would be (b). But I need to check references or examples. \n\nFor example, consider the helium atom. The ground state has a symmetric spatial wave function (both electrons in the 1s orbital) and an antisymmetric spin singlet. If you swap the positions of the electrons, the spatial part remains the same (since it's symmetric), and the spin part remains the same (since we're not swapping spins). Therefore, the total wave function is unchanged. Therefore, the answer would be (b). However, if you swap the particles (both position and spin), then the total wave function changes sign. But the question is about swapping spatial coordinates, not the entire particle exchange. Therefore, the answer should be (b) the wave function is unchanged. \n\nBut wait, another way to think: the total wave function is antisymmetric under exchange of all coordinates. If you swap only the spatial coordinates, then the wave function doesn't have to be antisymmetric under that operation. Therefore, swapping only spatial coordinates would leave the wave function unchanged because the spatial part is symmetric. The spin part is not being swapped, so it remains the same. Therefore, the total wave function is unchanged. Hence, answer (b). \n\nBut I'm a bit confused because sometimes in discussions, people might refer to exchanging particles as swapping their positions, but in reality, it's swapping all coordinates. However, the problem explicitly says \"spatial coordinates\", so I think the answer is (b). Therefore, the correct answer is (b) the wave function is unchanged.\n</think>\n\nWhen interchanging the spatial coordinates of two electrons in a total spin-0 state, the behavior of the wave function depends on the symmetry of its spatial and spin components. Electrons are fermions, requiring the total wave function to be antisymmetric under full exchange (spatial and spin coordinates). For a total spin-0 state, the spin part is antisymmetric (singlet state), necessitating the spatial part to be symmetric to satisfy the antisymmetry of the total wave function.\n\nIf **only the spatial coordinates** are interchanged (leaving spin coordinates unchanged), the symmetric spatial wave function remains unchanged. Since the spin part is not swapped, it also remains unchanged. Thus, the total wave function, being the product of the unchanged symmetric spatial part and the unchanged antisymmetric spin part, **does not change sign** and remains the same.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{B}", "final_answers": ["B"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "B", "expr2": "b"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "B", "expr2": "b"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-45", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) of this problem. So, the question is about finding the force acting on an electron in the plum pudding model of hydrogen. Hydrogen here means there's just one electron, right? The model is a sphere of positive charge with the electron embedded in it. \n\nFirst, I need to recall how the electric field inside a uniformly charged sphere behaves. Since the positive charge is distributed uniformly, the electric field inside should depend on the radius r from the center. Wait, Gauss's Law would be useful here. For a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field at a distance r from the center can be found by considering the charge enclosed within that radius.\n\nThe total positive charge is Ze, but since it's hydrogen, Z is 1. So the positive charge is +e, and the electron has charge -e. The positive charge is spread out in a sphere of radius a. So, when the electron is at a distance r from the center (where r is less than a), the enclosed positive charge Q_enc would be the total charge multiplied by the ratio of the volumes, because the charge is uniformly distributed. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the enclosed charge is Q_enc = e*(r³/a³). \n\nUsing Gauss's Law, the electric field E at radius r is given by E = Q_enc/(4πε₀r²). Plugging in Q_enc, that becomes E = (e*r³/(a³)) / (4πε₀r²) = (e*r)/(4πε₀a³). \n\nThen, the force on the electron is F = qE. The electron's charge is -e, so F = -e * E. Substituting E, we get F = -e*(e*r)/(4πε₀a³) = - (e² r)/(4πε₀ a³). \n\nWait, the negative sign indicates that the force is directed towards the center, which makes sense because the positive charge attracts the electron. So the magnitude is proportional to r, and it's a restoring force. That seems right. Let me check the steps again. \n\nTotal positive charge is e, radius a. At radius r, enclosed charge is (r/a)³ * e. Then Gauss's Law gives E = (e r³)/(4πε₀ a³ r²) ) = e r / (4πε₀ a³). Multiply by -e for the force: -e² r / (4πε₀ a³). Yep, that looks correct. So part (a) answer is F = - (e² / (4πε₀ a³)) r. \n\nFor part (b), the type of motion. Since the force is proportional to -r, this is a Hooke's law type force, which results in simple harmonic motion. So the electron would oscillate around the center with SHM. \n\nPart (c) asks for the frequency. For simple harmonic motion, the angular frequency ω is sqrt(k/m), where k is the spring constant. In this case, the force F = -kr, so k is e²/(4πε₀ a³). The mass m is the mass of the electron, m_e. Therefore, ω = sqrt( (e²)/(4πε₀ a³ m_e) ). The frequency f is ω/(2π), so f = (1/(2π)) sqrt( e²/(4πε₀ a³ m_e ) ). \n\nSimplifying that expression: Let's square the terms inside the square root. e²/(4πε₀ a³ m_e) can be written as (e²)/(4π ε₀ m_e a³). Taking the square root gives sqrt(e²/(4π ε₀ m_e a³)) = e/(2 sqrt(π ε₀ m_e a³))? Wait, maybe I should factor it differently. Let me compute the expression step by step. \n\nStarting with ω = sqrt( k/m ), where k = e²/(4πε₀ a³). So ω = sqrt( e²/(4πε₀ a³ m_e) ). Then f = ω/(2π) = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( e²/(4πε₀ a³ m_e) ). Let's factor out the 4π in the denominator. The expression inside the square root is e²/(4π ε₀ a³ m_e). So sqrt(e²/(4π ε₀ a³ m_e)) = e/(2 sqrt(π ε₀ a³ m_e))). Then multiplying by 1/(2π), we get f = e/(4π sqrt(π ε₀ a³ m_e)) ). Hmm, maybe simplifying further. Alternatively, combining the terms:\n\nf = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( e²/(4π ε₀ a³ m_e) ) = (e/(2π)) * sqrt(1/(4π ε₀ a³ m_e)) ) = e/(2π) * 1/(sqrt(4π ε₀ a³ m_e)) ) = e/(2π * 2 sqrt(π ε₀ a³ m_e)) ) = e/(4 π^(3/2) sqrt(ε₀ a³ m_e)) ). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to leave it as f = (1/(2π)) sqrt( e²/(4π ε₀ a³ m_e) ). Let me check if there's a more standard form. Maybe factor out the 4π:\n\nsqrt( e²/(4π ε₀ a³ m_e) ) = sqrt( e²/(4π ε₀ m_e a³) ) = (e)/(2) sqrt(1/(π ε₀ m_e a³)). Then f = (e)/(4π) sqrt(1/(π ε₀ m_e a³)). Not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, combining the constants:\n\n4π ε₀ is a term that appears in Coulomb's law. But perhaps the answer is better left as f = (1/(2π)) sqrt( e²/(4π ε₀ a³ m_e ) ). Alternatively, simplifying the constants:\n\ne²/(4π ε₀) is a common term, sometimes written as k_e e², but since k_e = 1/(4π ε₀), so e²/(4π ε₀) = k_e e². Wait, but maybe that's complicating. Let me just write the expression as:\n\nf = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{ \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 a^3 m_e} }.\n\nAlternatively, combining the 4π and the 2π:\n\nThe 4π in the denominator under the square root becomes 2√π when square rooted. So:\n\nsqrt(1/(4π)) = 1/(2 sqrt(π)), so the expression becomes:\n\nf = (1/(2π)) * (e/(2 sqrt(π ε₀ a³ m_e))) ) = e/(4 π sqrt(π ε₀ a³ m_e)) ) = e/(4 π^{3/2} sqrt( ε₀ a³ m_e )) ). \n\nBut perhaps the simplest form is the one with the square root over the entire fraction. Either way, the answer is expressed in terms of e, ε₀, a, m_e. So that's part (c).\n</think>\n\n(a) To find the force on the electron at a distance \\( r \\) from the center, we use Gauss's Law.

{"id": "atomic/1-42", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these two parts about Bohr's model and de Broglie's contribution. Starting with part (a). The question is asking which postulate in Bohr's original theory of the hydrogen atom led to the selection of allowed energy levels. I remember that Bohr introduced several postulates to explain the stability of the atom and the discrete energy levels. \n\nFirst, Bohr proposed that electrons orbit the nucleus in certain stable orbits without emitting radiation, which was a departure from classical electromagnetism. But the key postulate related to energy levels must be the one about angular momentum being quantized. Right, he stated that the angular momentum of the electron is an integer multiple of h/(2π), where h is Planck's constant. The formula is L = nħ, where n is a positive integer. This quantization of angular momentum leads directly to the quantization of the electron's energy levels because when you solve for the energy using this condition, you end up with discrete values.\n\nSo for part (a), the answer should be that Bohr postulated the quantization of the electron's angular momentum, specifically that it must be an integer multiple of h/(2π). This condition restricts the electron to certain orbits with specific energies, hence the allowed energy levels.\n\nMoving on to part (b). De Broglie later connected Bohr's postulate to the wave nature of the electron. De Broglie's hypothesis was that particles like electrons have a wavelength associated with them, given by λ = h/p, where p is momentum. The question asks to state and derive the relationship between Bohr's postulate and the de Broglie wavelength.\n\nBohr's quantization of angular momentum is L = mvr = nħ, where m is the electron mass, v is its velocity, r the orbit radius, and ħ is reduced Planck's constant. De Broglie suggested that the allowed orbits are those where the circumference of the orbit is an integer multiple of the electron's wavelength. That is, the standing wave condition: the circumference 2πr must equal nλ. \n\nSubstituting de Broglie's wavelength λ = h/(mv) into the standing wave condition gives 2πr = n(h/(mv)). Rearranging this, we get mvr = nh/(2π), which is exactly Bohr's quantization condition. Therefore, de Broglie's interpretation shows that the quantization of angular momentum arises from the requirement that the electron's orbit accommodates an integer number of its wavelength, forming a standing wave. This explains why only certain orbits are allowed, as others would lead to destructive interference of the electron wave.\n\nSo for part (b), the relationship is that the circumference of the electron's orbit is an integer multiple of the de Broglie wavelength. Deriving this connects Bohr's angular momentum quantization to the standing wave condition.\n</think>\n\n(a) The postulate that led to the choice of allowed energy levels in Bohr's theory is the **quantization of angular momentum**. Bohr proposed that the electron's angular momentum \\( L \\) in a hydrogen atom is restricted to integer multiples of \\( \\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi} \\):  \n\\[ L = m_e v r = n\\hbar \\quad (n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots), \\]  \nwhere \\( m_e \\) is the electron mass, \\( v \\) its velocity, \\( r \\) the orbit radius, and \\( n \\) a positive integer. This condition ensures discrete orbits and energy levels.\n\n(b) De Broglie related Bohr's postulate to the electron's wavelength by interpreting the allowed orbits as **standing waves**. For a stable orbit, the circumference \\( 2\\pi r \\) must equal an integer multiple of the de Broglie wavelength \\( \\lambda = \\frac{h}{m_e v} \\):  \n\\[ 2\\pi r = n\\lambda. \\]  \nSubstituting \\( \\lambda = \\frac{h}{m_e v} \\), we get:  \n\\[ 2\\pi r = n \\frac{h}{m_e v} \\implies m_e v r = n\\frac{h}{2\\pi} = n\\hbar. \\]  \nThis matches Bohr's angular momentum quantization condition, showing that the allowed orbits correspond to standing electron waves.  \n\n**Final Answers:**  \n(a) \\[ \\boxed{\\text{Quantization of angular momentum } (L = n\\hbar)} \\]  \n(b) \\[ \\boxed{2\\pi r = n\\lambda \\quad \\text{(derived from de Broglie's wavelength and Bohr's postulate)}} \\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Quantization of angular momentum } (L = n\\hbar)", "2\\pi r = n\\lambda \\quad \\text{(derived from de Broglie's wavelength and Bohr's postulate)}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Quantization of angular momentum } (L = n\\hbar)", "expr2": "mvr = n\\hbar"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "2\\pi r = n\\lambda \\quad \\text{(derived from de Broglie's wavelength and Bohr's postulate)}", "expr2": "mvr = n\\hbar"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/2-39", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve part (b) of this problem about the critical length of a uranium cube. Let me start by recalling what the problem is asking. The neutron density satisfies a differential equation that's a combination of diffusion (the A∇²ρ term) and a source term (Bρ). The cube has sides of length L, and the boundary condition is that the density is zero at the surface. The critical length L0 is the threshold where if the cube is larger than L0, the neutron density grows exponentially (leading to an explosion), and if it's smaller, the density decreases (no explosion). \n\nFirst, I need to find L0 in terms of A and B. Let me think about how to approach this. The equation given is a partial differential equation (PDE) involving time and space derivatives. Since the cube is a three-dimensional object with boundaries, I probably need to solve this PDE using separation of variables. The boundary conditions are Dirichlet (ρ=0 at the surfaces), so the solutions will involve sine or cosine functions that vanish at the boundaries. \n\nLet me write down the equation again:\n\n∂ρ/∂t = A∇²ρ + Bρ\n\nThis looks like a diffusion equation with a source term. The term A∇²ρ is the diffusion term, and Bρ is a term that's proportional to the density itself, which might represent production of neutrons, like a chain reaction. \n\nTo solve this, I can assume a solution of the form ρ(x, t) = X(x)Y(y)Z(z)T(t). Since the cube is symmetric, maybe the spatial part can be separated into functions of x, y, z each. Let me try separation of variables. \n\nAssume ρ(𝐱, t) = X(x)Y(y)Z(z)T(t). Plugging into the PDE:\n\nX Y Z dT/dt = A (X'' Y Z T + X Y'' Z T + X Y Z'' T) + B X Y Z T\n\nDivide both sides by X Y Z T:\n\n(1/T) dT/dt = A (X''/X + Y''/Y + Z''/Z) + B\n\nThe left side is a function of t, and the right side is a function of x, y, z. For equality to hold for all x, y, z, t, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call that constant λ. So:\n\ndT/dt = λ T\n\nand\n\nA (X''/X + Y''/Y + Z''/Z) + B = λ\n\nRearranging:\n\n(X''/X + Y''/Y + Z''/Z) = (λ - B)/A\n\nEach term X''/X, Y''/Y, Z''/Z must be constants themselves because they are functions of different variables. Let me denote:\n\nX''/X = -k_x²\n\nY''/Y = -k_y²\n\nZ''/Z = -k_z²\n\nSo each spatial direction contributes a separation constant. Then:\n\n(-k_x² - k_y² - k_z²) = (λ - B)/A\n\nTherefore:\n\nλ = B - A(k_x² + k_y² + k_z²)\n\nNow, the time equation solution is T(t) = T0 e^{λ t}\n\nFor the neutron density to be stable, λ must be zero. If λ > 0, the density grows exponentially (unstable), and if λ < 0, it decays. Therefore, the critical case is when λ = 0. So:\n\n0 = B - A(k_x² + k_y² + k_z²)\n\nThus, the critical condition is:\n\nk_x² + k_y² + k_z² = B/A\n\nNow, the spatial solutions X(x), Y(y), Z(z) must satisfy the boundary conditions. Since the cube has sides of length L, and the density is zero at x=0, x=L, similarly for y and z. Each of the functions X(x), Y(y), Z(z) must be sine functions that vanish at 0 and L. \n\nFor example, in the x-direction:\n\nX(x) = sin(n_x π x / L)\n\nSimilarly for Y and Z with n_y, n_z. The second derivative of X is:\n\nX'' = - (n_x π / L)^2 X\n\nTherefore, the separation constants are:\n\nk_x = n_x π / L\n\nSimilarly for k_y and k_z. Therefore:\n\nk_x² + k_y² + k_z² = (π² / L²)(n_x² + n_y² + n_z²)\n\nBut for the critical case, this sum must equal B/A:\n\n(π² / L0²)(n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) = B/A\n\nSolving for L0:\n\nL0² = (π² (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) A) / B\n\nTherefore,\n\nL0 = π sqrt( (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) A / B )\n\nBut here, n_x, n_y, n_z are positive integers (since they are the mode numbers for the sine functions). The critical length corresponds to the smallest possible L0, which occurs when the sum n_x² + n_y² + n_z² is minimized. The smallest possible sum for positive integers is 1² + 1² + 1² = 3. Therefore, the minimal L0 is:\n\nL0 = π sqrt(3 A / B )\n\nWait, but let me check. The critical length is when the lowest mode (n_x = n_y = n_z =1) gives the equality. Because higher modes would require a larger L0 to satisfy the equation, but since we are looking for the critical length where instability begins, it's the smallest L where the exponential growth starts. Wait, actually, the critical length is the minimal L such that the lowest mode (n=1 in all directions) gives λ=0. If L is larger than L0, then even the lowest mode will have λ >=0, leading to growth. If L is smaller, then even the lowest mode has λ <0, leading to decay. Therefore, the critical length is when the lowest mode (n_x=n_y=n_z=1) satisfies the equation.\n\nTherefore, substituting n_x=n_y=n_z=1:\n\nL0 = π sqrt(3 A / B )\n\nSo that's the critical length. Let me verify this.\n\nSuppose L > L0. Then, the denominator in sqrt(3 A / B ) is smaller, so the term (π² / L²)(1 +1 +1) would be less than B/A. Therefore, λ = B - A*(3 π² / L²) would be positive, leading to exponential growth. Conversely, if L < L0, then λ is negative, leading to decay. Therefore, L0 is indeed the critical length.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be L0 = π sqrt(3A/B). But let me check units to make sure. A has units of [length]^2/[time] because the term A∇²ρ has units of [A][ρ]/[length]^2, and the time derivative ∂ρ/∂t has units [ρ]/[time]. Therefore, A must have units [length]^2/[time]. B has units 1/[time] because Bρ must have units [ρ]/[time]. Then sqrt(A/B) has units sqrt( [length]^2/[time] / [1/time] ) = sqrt( [length]^2 ) = [length], so sqrt(3A/B) has units of length. Multiply by π (dimensionless), so L0 has units of length. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the critical length L0 is π times sqrt(3A/B). So the answer is L0 = π sqrt(3A/B). So boxed, that would be \\boxed{L_0 = \\pi \\sqrt{\\dfrac{3A}{B}}}.\n</think>\n\nFor part (b), we analyze the critical length \\( L_0 \\) by solving the given PDE with boundary conditions.

{"id": "atomic/1-21", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the Doppler width of an optical line from an atom in a flame. Hmm, Doppler broadening... right, that's when the thermal motion of atoms causes a shift in the observed frequency of the emitted light. The faster the atoms move, the broader the spectral line becomes. The formula for the Doppler width, if I remember correctly, involves the temperature, the frequency of the transition, the mass of the atoms, and some constants. Let me recall the exact formula.\n\nI think the Doppler width (Δν) is given by the equation Δν = ν₀ * sqrt( (8 k T ln 2) / (m c²) ), where ν₀ is the central frequency, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, m is the mass of the atom, and c is the speed of light. Wait, or is it the other way around? Maybe I should check the derivation.\n\nDoppler broadening arises because the atoms are moving towards or away from the observer, causing a Doppler shift. The distribution of velocities in a gas at thermal equilibrium follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The width of the spectral line is related to the most probable velocity or the average velocity. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) is what we're looking for here.\n\nSo the FWHM for Doppler broadening is Δν = (2 ν₀ / c) * sqrt( (2 k T ln 2) / m ). Let me verify that. Let's break it down. The term sqrt(2 k T / m) is the root mean square velocity, but since we need the FWHM, there's a factor involving ln 2. Let me check the exact coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, another form I've seen is Δν = (ν₀ / c) * sqrt( (8 k T ln 2) / m ). Wait, that might be the same as the previous one. Let me compute both expressions. Let's see:\n\nIf we take (2 ν₀ / c) * sqrt( (2 k T ln 2) / m ), that would be (2 ν₀ / c) * sqrt(2 k T ln 2 / m ). Squaring that gives (4 ν₀² / c²) * (2 k T ln 2 / m ) = (8 ν₀² k T ln 2) / (m c²). Then taking the square root again? Wait, no, maybe I confused the formula.\n\nAlternatively, the standard formula for Doppler FWHM is Δν = (2 ν₀ / c) * sqrt( 2 k T ln 2 / m ). Let me check units. The term inside the sqrt has units of (J/(K) * K / kg) ) = (kg m²/s² / kg ) = m²/s². So sqrt gives m/s. Then multiplying by (2 ν₀ / c), which is (1/s) * (m/s) / (m/s) )? Wait, ν₀ is in Hz (1/s), c is in m/s. So (2 ν₀ / c) has units of (1/s) / (m/s) ) = 1/m. Then multiplied by sqrt( (k T)/m ) which is m/s. So overall, (1/m) * (m/s) ) = 1/s, which is Hz. That makes sense. So the units check out.\n\nAlternatively, another way to write it is Δν = ν₀ * sqrt( (8 k T ln 2) / (m c²) ). Let's check units here. Inside the sqrt: (J/(K) * K ) / (kg * m²/s²) ) = (kg m²/s²) / (kg m²/s²) ) = dimensionless. So sqrt is dimensionless. Then multiplied by ν₀ (1/s) gives 1/s, which is correct. So both expressions are equivalent. Let me confirm:\n\nTake the first expression: (2 ν₀ / c) * sqrt(2 k T ln 2 / m )\n\nSquare it: (4 ν₀² / c²) * (2 k T ln 2 / m ) = (8 ν₀² k T ln 2) / (m c²)\n\nTake the square root: sqrt(8 ν₀² k T ln 2 / (m c²)) ) = ν₀ * sqrt(8 k T ln 2 / (m c²))\n\nSo yes, both expressions are equivalent. So Δν can be written either way.\n\nNow, the problem is giving options: 10^6, 10^9, 10^{13}, 10^{16} Hz. We need to choose the correct one. To compute this, we need to know the temperature of the flame, the mass of the atom, and the central frequency ν₀.\n\nWait, but the problem statement doesn't give specific numbers. Wait, the question is presented as a multiple-choice question where the options are 10^6, 10^9, 10^{13}, 10^{16} Hz. But the user hasn't provided the actual question. Wait, looking back: \"The Doppler width of an optical line from an atom in a flame is $10^6$, $10^9$, $10^{13}$, $10^{16}$ Hz.\" Wait, maybe the question is to choose the correct order of magnitude. But the user hasn't given the full problem. Wait, perhaps the original question is missing some parameters, but in the user's input, it's presented as a list of options. Maybe the user is expecting me to recall typical values for Doppler broadening in a flame.\n\nWait, let me think. A typical flame temperature is around 1000-2000 K. Let's take 2000 K as a rough estimate. The atom in question is probably something like sodium, which is common in flame tests. Sodium has an atomic mass of about 23 g/mol, so m = 23 u = 23 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.8e-26 kg.\n\nThe optical frequency ν₀ is in the visible range, say around 5e14 Hz (corresponding to 600 nm wavelength).\n\nNow plug into the formula:\n\nΔν = ν₀ * sqrt( (8 k T ln 2) / (m c²) )\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\nk = 1.38e-23 J/K\n\nT = 2000 K\n\nln 2 ≈ 0.693\n\nm = 3.8e-26 kg\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nCompute the numerator inside the sqrt: 8 * 1.38e-23 * 2000 * 0.693\n\nFirst compute 8 * 1.38e-23 = 1.104e-22\n\nMultiply by 2000: 1.104e-22 * 2e3 = 2.208e-19\n\nMultiply by 0.693: 2.208e-19 * 0.693 ≈ 1.53e-19\n\nDenominator: m c² = 3.8e-26 kg * (3e8)^2 = 3.8e-26 * 9e16 = 3.42e-9\n\nSo the ratio inside the sqrt: 1.53e-19 / 3.42e-9 ≈ 4.47e-11\n\nTake sqrt: sqrt(4.47e-11) ≈ 6.69e-6\n\nMultiply by ν₀ = 5e14 Hz: 5e14 * 6.69e-6 ≈ 3.345e9 Hz ≈ 3.3e9 Hz. So around 1e9 Hz. Therefore, the answer would be 10^9 Hz.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I made any calculation errors. Let me recompute the numerator:\n\n8 * k * T * ln2 = 8 * 1.38e-23 * 2000 * 0.693\n\nFirst compute 8 * 1.38e-23 = 1.104e-22\n\nMultiply by 2000: 1.104e-22 * 2e3 = 2.208e-19\n\nMultiply by 0.693: 2.208e-19 * 0.693 ≈ 1.53e-19\n\nDenominator: m c² = 3.8e-26 kg * (9e16) = 3.8e-26 *9e16 = 3.42e-9\n\nSo ratio: 1.53e-19 / 3.42e-9 ≈ 4.47e-11\n\nsqrt(4.47e-11) ≈ 6.69e-6\n\nMultiply by ν₀ = 5e14 Hz: 5e14 * 6.69e-6 = 5e14 * 6.69e-6 = 3.345e9 Hz ≈ 3.3e9 Hz. So yes, that's approximately 1e9 Hz. Therefore, the answer is 10^9 Hz.\n\nAlternatively, if the temperature is lower, say 1000 K, then the Doppler width would be sqrt(1000/2000) = sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.707 times smaller. So 3.3e9 * 0.7 ≈ 2.3e9, still in the 1e9 order of magnitude. So even if the temperature is lower, it's still around 1e9 Hz.\n\nAlternatively, if the atom is lighter, like hydrogen, but in a flame, it's more likely to be heavier atoms like sodium or potassium. For hydrogen, m is about 1.67e-27 kg, which would make the Doppler width larger. Let's check:\n\nIf m = 1.67e-27 kg (hydrogen), then denominator m c² = 1.67e-27 *9e16 = 1.503e-10\n\nRatio: 1.53e-19 / 1.503e-10 ≈ 1.02e-9\n\nsqrt(1.02e-9) ≈ 3.19e-5\n\nMultiply by ν₀ = 5e14: 5e14 *3.19e-5 ≈ 1.6e10 Hz, which is 1e10 Hz. But the options given don't include 1e10. So if the atom were hydrogen, the Doppler width would be higher, but in a flame, hydrogen might not be emitting optical lines. Typically, flames are used for alkali metals which have visible emissions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 10^9 Hz.\n</think>\n\nThe Doppler width of an optical line from an atom in a flame is determined by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta \\nu = \\nu_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k T \\ln 2}{m c^2}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\nu_0 \\) is the central frequency, \\( k \\) is Boltzmann's constant, \\( T \\) is the flame temperature, \\( m \\) is the atomic mass, and \\( c \\) is the speed of light. \n\nFor a typical flame temperature of \\( T \\approx 2000 \\, \\text{K} \\), an atomic mass \\( m \\approx 3.8 \\times 10^{-26} \\, \\text{kg} \\) (e.g., sodium), and an optical frequency \\( \\nu_0 \\approx 5 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{Hz} \\), the calculation yields:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta \\nu \\approx 3.3 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{Hz}\n\\]\n\nThis value aligns with the order of magnitude \\( 10^9 \\, \\text{Hz} \\). Even for variations in temperature or atomic mass, the result remains within this range. \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10^9 \\, \\text{Hz}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["10^9 \\, \\text{Hz}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "10^9 \\, \\text{Hz}", "expr2": "10^9 \\, \\text{Hz}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-19", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the photon frequency required for an atom to transition from its ground state to an excited state, considering relativistic mass changes. Let me start by recalling the problem statement. The atom is initially at rest in the lab frame. The ground state has mass M, and the excited state has mass M + Δ. The transition happens by absorbing a photon. So, I need to figure out what the frequency of that photon must be.\n\nHmm, conservation of energy and momentum must come into play here. Since the atom is initially at rest, its momentum is zero. When it absorbs a photon, which has momentum, the atom must move in such a way that the total momentum remains zero. Wait, but photons carry momentum, so after absorption, the atom's momentum should balance the photon's momentum. Wait, but the atom was initially at rest. So before absorption, the total momentum is just the photon's momentum. After absorption, the atom is moving, so its momentum must equal the photon's momentum in the opposite direction to conserve momentum. But wait, if the atom is initially at rest and absorbs a photon, the system (atom + photon) must conserve both energy and momentum.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the photon's energy as E_photon = hν, where h is Planck's constant and ν is the frequency. The photon's momentum is p_photon = E_photon / c = hν / c, since for photons, E = pc.\n\nBefore absorption, the atom is at rest, so its energy is just its rest energy: E_initial = M c². The photon's energy is hν, so total initial energy is E_initial_total = M c² + hν.\n\nAfter absorption, the atom is in the excited state with mass M + Δ and is moving with some velocity v. Its total energy will then be the relativistic energy of the moving excited atom: E_final = γ (M + Δ) c², where γ is the Lorentz factor γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The momentum of the atom after absorption is p_final = γ (M + Δ) v.\n\nNow, conservation of momentum: before absorption, the photon has momentum p_photon = hν / c (direction matters here; let's assume the photon is moving in the +x direction). The atom is at rest, so initial total momentum is p_initial = hν / c. After absorption, the atom must have momentum p_final = hν / c in the same direction to conserve momentum. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, if the atom is initially at rest and absorbs a photon, the total momentum after absorption should be equal to the photon's momentum. Wait, but the photon is absorbed, so the atom's momentum must equal the photon's original momentum. Wait, but the photon is absorbed, so the system's total momentum before is just the photon's momentum. After absorption, the atom must have that same momentum. So yes, p_final = p_photon = hν / c.\n\nSo, from conservation of momentum: γ (M + Δ) v = hν / c.\n\nFrom conservation of energy: M c² + hν = γ (M + Δ) c².\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1. γ (M + Δ) v = hν / c\n2. M c² + hν = γ (M + Δ) c²\n\nWe need to solve for ν. Let me try to express γ in terms of v. γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But maybe we can eliminate v from the equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: hν / c = γ (M + Δ) v. Let's solve for v: v = (hν) / [c γ (M + Δ)].\n\nBut this might not be helpful. Alternatively, let's use the relation between γ and velocity. Let's square both equations to relate them. Alternatively, note that in special relativity, the energy and momentum are related by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Wait, maybe that's a better approach.\n\nAfter absorption, the atom has energy E_final = γ (M + Δ) c² and momentum p_final = hν / c. So, using the energy-momentum relation:\n\nE_final² = (p_final c)² + [(M + Δ) c²]^2\n\nBut E_final is also equal to M c² + hν from energy conservation. So:\n\n(M c² + hν)^2 = (hν c)^2 + [(M + Δ) c²]^2\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n(M c²)^2 + 2 M c² hν + (hν)^2 = (hν c)^2 + (M + Δ)^2 c^4\n\nSubtract (hν c)^2 from both sides:\n\n(M c²)^2 + 2 M c² hν + (hν)^2 - (hν c)^2 = (M + Δ)^2 c^4\n\nWait, but (hν)^2 - (hν c)^2 would be (hν)^2 (1 - c²), which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the left side is (M c² + hν)^2, which expands to M² c^4 + 2 M c² hν + h² ν². The right side is (hν c)^2 + (M + Δ)^2 c^4. So:\n\nM² c^4 + 2 M c² hν + h² ν² = h² ν² c² + (M + Δ)^2 c^4\n\nSubtract h² ν² c² from both sides:\n\nM² c^4 + 2 M c² hν + h² ν² (1 - c²) = (M + Δ)^2 c^4\n\nWait, but this seems complicated. Let me check the units. Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Let me re-express the energy-momentum relation correctly. The energy after absorption is E_final = M c² + hν, and the momentum is p_final = hν / c. Then, according to the energy-momentum relation:\n\nE_final² = (p_final c)^2 + (m_rest c²)^2\n\nWhere m_rest is the rest mass of the atom after absorption, which is (M + Δ). Therefore:\n\n(M c² + hν)^2 = (hν c)^2 + (M + Δ)^2 c^4\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nM² c^4 + 2 M c² hν + h² ν² = h² ν² c² + (M + Δ)^2 c^4\n\nNow, subtract h² ν² c² from both sides:\n\nM² c^4 + 2 M c² hν + h² ν² (1 - c²) = (M + Δ)^2 c^4\n\nWait, but (1 - c²) would be negative, which complicates things. Maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check the expansion again. Wait, the left side is (M c² + hν)^2 = M² c^4 + 2 M c² hν + h² ν². The right side is (hν c)^2 + (M + Δ)^2 c^4. So:\n\nM² c^4 + 2 M c² hν + h² ν² = h² ν² c² + (M² + 2 M Δ + Δ²) c^4\n\nNow, subtract M² c^4 from both sides:\n\n2 M c² hν + h² ν² = h² ν² c² + (2 M Δ + Δ²) c^4\n\nBring all terms to the left side:\n\n2 M c² hν + h² ν² - h² ν² c² - (2 M Δ + Δ²) c^4 = 0\n\nFactor h² ν² (1 - c²) + 2 M c² hν - (2 M Δ + Δ²) c^4 = 0\n\nWait, but this seems messy. Let me factor terms differently. Let's collect terms with hν:\n\nh² ν² (1 - c²) + 2 M c² hν - (2 M Δ + Δ²) c^4 = 0\n\nWait, but 1 - c² is negative, since c is the speed of light. Wait, but units here might be off. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy-momentum relation. Let me check again. The energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So, for the final state, E_final = (M c² + hν), and p_final = hν / c. Then:\n\nE_final² = (p_final c)^2 + ( (M + Δ) c² )²\n\nSo:\n\n(M c² + hν)^2 = (hν)^2 c² + (M + Δ)^2 c^4\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nM² c^4 + 2 M c² hν + h² ν² = h² ν² c² + (M² + 2 M Δ + Δ²) c^4\n\nNow, subtract the right side from the left side:\n\nM² c^4 + 2 M c² hν + h² ν² - h² ν² c² - M² c^4 - 2 M Δ c^4 - Δ² c^4 = 0\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n2 M c² hν + h² ν² (1 - c²) - 2 M Δ c^4 - Δ² c^4 = 0\n\nHmm, this still looks complicated. Let's factor out c^4 where possible. Let's divide all terms by c^4 to make it dimensionless:\n\n2 M hν / c² + h² ν² (1 - c²)/c^4 - 2 M Δ - Δ² = 0\n\nWait, but this might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps we can divide through by c^4:\n\n[2 M c² hν + h² ν² (1 - c²) - 2 M Δ c^4 - Δ² c^4] / c^4 = 0\n\nBut this seems messy. Maybe there's a better approach. Let's consider that Δ is small compared to M. But the problem doesn't state that, so maybe we can't assume that. Alternatively, perhaps we can rearrange the equation to solve for ν.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\n2 M c² hν = h² ν² (c² - 1) + (2 M Δ + Δ²) c^4\n\nWait, but c² - 1 would be positive since c is the speed of light (assuming units where c is not 1). Wait, but in SI units, c is about 3e8 m/s, so c² is a large number. But if we are using natural units where c=1, then this term would be zero, which complicates things. Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be treated in natural units where c=1? Wait, but the problem mentions mass as M and M + Δ, so maybe we need to keep c in the equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Let's go back to the two original equations:\n\n1. γ (M + Δ) v = hν / c\n2. M c² + hν = γ (M + Δ) c²\n\nLet me solve equation 2 for γ:\n\nγ = (M c² + hν) / [ (M + Δ) c² ]\n\nThen, substitute γ into equation 1:\n\n[ (M c² + hν) / ( (M + Δ) c² ) ] * (M + Δ) v = hν / c\n\nSimplify:\n\n(M c² + hν) v / c² = hν / c\n\nMultiply both sides by c²:\n\n(M c² + hν) v = hν c\n\nSolve for v:\n\nv = [ hν c ] / (M c² + hν )\n\nNow, substitute this expression for v into the Lorentz factor γ. Remember that γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute v²/c²:\n\nv²/c² = [ hν c / (M c² + hν ) ]² / c² = [ h² ν² c² / (M c² + hν )² ] / c² = h² ν² / (M c² + hν )²\n\nSo, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - h² ν² / (M c² + hν )² = [ (M c² + hν )² - h² ν² ] / (M c² + hν )²\n\nExpand the numerator:\n\n(M c² + hν )² - h² ν² = M² c^4 + 2 M c² hν + h² ν² - h² ν² = M² c^4 + 2 M c² hν\n\nThus, 1 - v²/c² = [ M² c^4 + 2 M c² hν ] / (M c² + hν )² = [ M c² (M c² + 2 hν ) ] / (M c² + hν )²\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. But since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), then:\n\nγ = (M c² + hν ) / sqrt( M² c^4 + 2 M c² hν )\n\nBut from equation 2, γ = (M c² + hν ) / [ (M + Δ) c² ]\n\nSo equate the two expressions for γ:\n\n(M c² + hν ) / sqrt( M² c^4 + 2 M c² hν ) = (M c² + hν ) / [ (M + Δ) c² ]\n\nCancel (M c² + hν ) from both sides (assuming it's non-zero, which it is):\n\n1 / sqrt( M² c^4 + 2 M c² hν ) = 1 / [ (M + Δ) c² ]\n\nTake reciprocal of both sides:\n\nsqrt( M² c^4 + 2 M c² hν ) = (M + Δ) c²\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nM² c^4 + 2 M c² hν = (M + Δ)^2 c^4\n\nSubtract M² c^4 from both sides:\n\n2 M c² hν = ( (M + Δ)^2 - M² ) c^4\n\nExpand (M + Δ)^2:\n\n= (M² + 2 M Δ + Δ² - M² ) c^4\n= (2 M Δ + Δ²) c^4\n\nThus:\n\n2 M c² hν = (2 M Δ + Δ²) c^4\n\nDivide both sides by 2 M c² h:\n\nν = (2 M Δ + Δ²) c^4 / (2 M c² h )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n= [ Δ (2 M + Δ) c^4 ] / (2 M c² h )\n= [ Δ (2 M + Δ) c² ] / (2 M h )\n\nFactor out 2 M from the numerator:\n\n= [ Δ c² (2 M + Δ) ] / (2 M h )\n= [ Δ c² (2 M (1 + Δ/(2 M)) ) ] / (2 M h )\n= [ Δ c² * 2 M (1 + Δ/(2 M)) ) ] / (2 M h )\n= [ Δ c² (1 + Δ/(2 M)) ) ] / h\n\nSo:\n\nν = (Δ c² / h) (1 + Δ/(2 M))\n\nBut wait, this seems like a term that's a first-order approximation if Δ is small compared to M. However, the problem doesn't state that Δ is small, so maybe this is the exact expression. Wait, but let's check the algebra again.\n\nFrom 2 M c² hν = (2 M Δ + Δ²) c^4\n\nThen ν = (2 M Δ + Δ²) c^4 / (2 M c² h )\n\nSimplify numerator: (2 M Δ + Δ²) c^4 = Δ c^4 (2 M + Δ)\n\nDenominator: 2 M c² h\n\nSo ν = Δ c^4 (2 M + Δ) / (2 M c² h ) = Δ c² (2 M + Δ) / (2 M h )\n\nFactor 2 M from numerator:\n\n= Δ c² (2 M (1 + Δ/(2 M)) ) / (2 M h )\n\nCancel 2 M:\n\n= Δ c² (1 + Δ/(2 M)) / h\n\nSo ν = (Δ c² / h) (1 + Δ/(2 M))\n\nBut this seems a bit counterintuitive. Let me check with a different approach. Suppose the atom is at rest, and absorbs a photon. The rest mass increases from M to M + Δ. But in reality, when an atom absorbs a photon, the photon's energy contributes both to the mass increase and to the kinetic energy of the atom. However, in this problem, the mass of the excited state is given as M + Δ, so the energy difference between the states is Δ c². But wait, maybe there's a simpler way. If the atom were to remain at rest after absorbing the photon, then the photon's energy would have to exactly equal the mass difference Δ c². But in reality, because the photon has momentum, the atom cannot remain at rest; it must recoil. Therefore, the photon's energy must not only provide the mass increase but also the kinetic energy of the atom. Hence, the required photon energy is greater than Δ c².\n\nBut according to the expression we derived, ν = (Δ c² / h) (1 + Δ/(2 M)). If Δ is much smaller than M, then this approximates to ν ≈ Δ c² / h (1 + Δ/(2 M)) ≈ Δ c² / h (since Δ/(2 M) is negligible). But the exact expression includes the term Δ/(2 M). However, this seems different from the usual result I remember for the recoil effect. Wait, in the usual Doppler shift or recoil effect, when an atom at rest absorbs a photon, the photon's frequency has to be slightly higher than the resonance frequency to account for the recoil kinetic energy. The standard result is that the photon's energy is Δ E = h ν = Δ mc² + (h ν)^2/(2 M c²), but this is a non-relativistic approximation. Let me check.\n\nIn non-relativistic terms, the kinetic energy of the atom after absorbing the photon is p²/(2 M), where p = h ν / c. So:\n\nh ν = Δ M c² + (h ν)^2/(2 M c²)\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in ν. Let's rearrange:\n\n(h ν)^2/(2 M c²) - h ν + Δ M c² = 0\n\nMultiply through by 2 M c² / h²:\n\nν² - (2 M c² / h) ν + (2 M c² Δ M c²)/h² = 0\n\nWait, this seems messy. Let me instead write the equation as:\n\n(h ν)^2/(2 M c²) - h ν + Δ M c² = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 M c²:\n\n(h ν)^2 - 2 M c² h ν + 2 M^2 c^4 Δ = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic in hν:\n\n(hν)^2 - 2 M c² (hν) + 2 M^2 c^4 Δ = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nhν = [2 M c² ± sqrt(4 M² c^4 - 8 M² c^4 Δ)] / 2\n\nBut this seems problematic because the discriminant would be 4 M² c^4 (1 - 2 Δ). If Δ is small, then sqrt(1 - 2 Δ) ≈ 1 - Δ. But this approach might not be valid. Alternatively, perhaps the non-relativistic approximation gives hν ≈ Δ M c² + (hν)^2/(2 M c²). If we assume that the second term is small compared to the first, we can approximate hν ≈ Δ M c², then substitute into the second term:\n\nhν ≈ Δ M c² + (Δ M c²)^2/(2 M c²) = Δ M c² + Δ² M c² / 2\n\nSo hν ≈ Δ M c² (1 + Δ/(2 M))\n\nWhich gives ν ≈ (Δ M c² / h)(1 + Δ/(2 M)) = (Δ c² / h)(M + Δ/2)\n\nWait, but this seems different from our earlier relativistic result. Wait, in our relativistic derivation, we got ν = (Δ c² / h)(1 + Δ/(2 M)). But here, in the non-relativistic limit, assuming Δ is small compared to M, we get ν ≈ (Δ c² / h)(1 + Δ/(2 M)). Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the leading term is Δ c² / h, and the next term is (Δ c² / h)(Δ/(2 M)). But if Δ is small compared to M, then Δ/(2 M) is a small correction. However, in our exact relativistic result, we have ν = (Δ c² / h)(1 + Δ/(2 M)). So this suggests that even the exact result is similar to the non-relativistic approximation. But this seems contradictory because the exact treatment should differ. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the relativistic approach.\n\nWait, let's go back to the energy-momentum relation. After absorbing the photon, the atom's energy is E = γ (M + Δ) c², and momentum p = γ (M + Δ) v. From conservation of momentum, p = hν / c. From conservation of energy, E = M c² + hν.\n\nBut using the energy-momentum relation:\n\nE² = (pc)^2 + ( (M + Δ) c² )²\n\nSo:\n\n(M c² + hν)^2 = (hν c)^2 + (M + Δ)^2 c^4\n\nExpanding left side:\n\nM² c^4 + 2 M c² hν + h² ν² = h² ν² c² + (M² + 2 M Δ + Δ²) c^4\n\nSubtract M² c^4 from both sides:\n\n2 M c² hν + h² ν² = h² ν² c² + 2 M Δ c^4 + Δ² c^4\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n2 M c² hν + h² ν² - h² ν² c² - 2 M Δ c^4 - Δ² c^4 = 0\n\nFactor terms:\n\nh² ν² (1 - c²) + 2 M c² hν - c^4 (2 M Δ + Δ²) = 0\n\nBut this seems problematic because (1 - c²) is negative. Wait, but perhaps there's a miscalculation. Wait, the term h² ν² (1 - c²) is actually h² ν² (1 - c²) = h² ν² (1 - (c^2)) which is negative. Let me rearrange:\n\nh² ν² (c² - 1) = 2 M c² hν - c^4 (2 M Δ + Δ²)\n\nBut this still seems complicated. Let's factor out c^4:\n\nDivide both sides by c^4:\n\nh² ν² (c² - 1)/c^4 + 2 M hν /c² - (2 M Δ + Δ²) = 0\n\nBut this might not help. Alternatively, let's consider that in natural units where c=1, but the problem is presented with c explicitly. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that the rest mass of the system before absorption is M (atom) plus the photon's energy. But photons are massless, so the rest mass of the system before absorption is not straightforward. However, after absorption, the rest mass is M + Δ. The process must conserve both energy and momentum.\n\nAlternatively, using the relativistic energy and momentum conservation:\n\nBefore absorption:\n\n- Atom: energy = M c², momentum = 0\n- Photon: energy = hν, momentum = hν / c\n\nTotal energy: M c² + hν\nTotal momentum: hν / c\n\nAfter absorption:\n\n- Atom: energy = sqrt( (p c)^2 + ( (M + Δ) c² )^2 ), momentum = p\n\nBy conservation, p = hν / c\n\nSo energy after: sqrt( (hν)^2 c² + ( (M + Δ) c² )^2 )\n\nSet equal to total energy before:\n\nsqrt( (hν)^2 c² + ( (M + Δ) c² )^2 ) = M c² + hν\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(hν)^2 c² + (M + Δ)^2 c^4 = M² c^4 + 2 M c² hν + (hν)^2\n\nSubtract (hν)^2 from both sides:\n\n(hν)^2 (c² - 1) + (M + Δ)^2 c^4 = M² c^4 + 2 M c² hν\n\nRearrange:\n\n(hν)^2 (c² - 1) - 2 M c² hν + [ (M + Δ)^2 - M² ] c^4 = 0\n\nCompute [ (M + Δ)^2 - M² ] = 2 M Δ + Δ²\n\nSo:\n\n(hν)^2 (c² - 1) - 2 M c² hν + (2 M Δ + Δ²) c^4 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in hν. Let's write it as:\n\nA (hν)^2 + B (hν) + C = 0\n\nWhere:\n\nA = c² - 1\n\nB = -2 M c²\n\nC = (2 M Δ + Δ²) c^4\n\nThe quadratic solution is:\n\nhν = [2 M c² ± sqrt( (2 M c²)^2 - 4 (c² - 1)(2 M Δ + Δ²) c^4 ) ] / [2 (c² - 1)]\n\nBut this seems very complicated. Let's check if this can be simplified. Let's compute the discriminant:\n\nD = (2 M c²)^2 - 4 (c² - 1)(2 M Δ + Δ²) c^4\n\n= 4 M² c^4 - 4 (c² - 1) c^4 (2 M Δ + Δ²)\n\nFactor out 4 c^4:\n\n= 4 c^4 [ M² - (c² - 1)(2 M Δ + Δ²) ]\n\nThis is still complicated. Perhaps there's a better approach. Let's consider that in the non-relativistic limit, where c is large, but velocities are small. However, this might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that the mass difference Δ is due to the photon's energy, but that's not correct because the photon is absorbed, contributing both energy and momentum.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is intended to be solved using the relativistic mass increase, where the rest mass of the atom increases by Δ when excited, and the photon's energy must account for both this mass increase and the kinetic energy due to recoil. However, the exact solution requires solving the quadratic equation we derived earlier.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that when the atom absorbs the photon, the total energy is the sum of the atom's rest energy and the photon's energy, and the total momentum is the photon's momentum. After absorption, the atom's rest mass is M + Δ, but it's moving with some velocity, so its total energy is γ (M + Δ) c² and momentum γ (M + Δ) v. Setting these equal to the initial total energy and momentum:\n\nγ (M + Δ) c² = M c² + hν\n\nγ (M + Δ) v = hν / c\n\nFrom the second equation, v = (hν) / [γ (M + Δ) c]\n\nSubstitute v into the first equation:\n\nγ (M + Δ) c² = M c² + hν\n\nDivide both sides by c²:\n\nγ (M + Δ) = M + hν / c²\n\nNow, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's express γ in terms of v from the second equation. But this seems circular. Alternatively, let's use the expression for v in terms of γ and substitute into the γ equation.\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\nv = (hν) / [γ (M + Δ) c]\n\nThen, v² = (h² ν²) / [γ² (M + Δ)^2 c²]\n\nSo, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - (h² ν²) / [γ² (M + Δ)^2 c^4]\n\nBut γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so γ² = 1 / (1 - v²/c²)\n\nSubstitute this into the expression:\n\n1 - v²/c² = 1 - (h² ν²) / [ (1 / (1 - v²/c²)) (M + Δ)^2 c^4 ]\n\nThis seems too convoluted. Maybe there's a better way. Let's go back to the two equations:\n\n1. γ (M + Δ) v = hν / c\n\n2. γ (M + Δ) c² = M c² + hν\n\nLet me divide equation 1 by equation 2:\n\n[γ (M + Δ) v] / [γ (M + Δ) c²] = (hν / c) / (M c² + hν)\n\nSimplify:\n\nv / c² = (hν) / [c (M c² + hν)]\n\nMultiply both sides by c²:\n\nv = (hν c) / (M c² + hν )\n\nNow, substitute this expression for v into the γ equation. Recall that γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute v²/c²:\n\nv²/c² = [ (hν c)^2 ] / [ (M c² + hν )^2 c² ] = (h² ν²) / (M c² + hν )^2\n\nThus, 1 - v²/c² = [ (M c² + hν )^2 - h² ν² ] / (M c² + hν )^2\n\nExpand the numerator:\n\n(M c² + hν )^2 - h² ν² = M² c^4 + 2 M c² hν + h² ν² - h² ν² = M² c^4 + 2 M c² hν\n\nSo, 1 - v²/c² = (M² c^4 + 2 M c² hν ) / (M c² + hν )^2\n\nTherefore, γ = (M c² + hν ) / sqrt(M² c^4 + 2 M c² hν )\n\nBut from equation 2, γ = (M c² + hν ) / [ (M + Δ) c² ]\n\nEquate the two expressions for γ:\n\n(M c² + hν ) / sqrt(M² c^4 + 2 M c² hν ) = (M c² + hν ) / [ (M + Δ) c² ]\n\nCancel (M c² + hν ) from both sides:\n\n1 / sqrt(M² c^4 + 2 M c² hν ) = 1 / [ (M + Δ) c² ]\n\nTake reciprocal:\n\nsqrt(M² c^4 + 2 M c² hν ) = (M + Δ) c²\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nM² c^4 + 2 M c² hν = (M + Δ)^2 c^4\n\nSubtract M² c^4 from both sides:\n\n2 M c² hν = (2 M Δ + Δ²) c^4\n\nSolve for hν:\n\nhν = (2 M Δ + Δ²) c^4 / (2 M c² )\n\nSimplify:\n\nhν = (Δ (2 M + Δ) c^4 ) / (2 M c² ) = Δ c² (2 M + Δ) / (2 M )\n\nFactor out 2 M:\n\nhν = Δ c² (1 + Δ/(2 M))\n\nTherefore, the frequency ν is:\n\nν = (Δ c² / h) (1 + Δ/(2 M))\n\nThis is the exact result. So the photon's frequency must be ν = (Δ c² / h)(1 + Δ/(2 M)). This accounts for both the mass increase and the recoil kinetic energy of the atom. If Δ is much smaller than M, the term Δ/(2 M) becomes negligible, and ν ≈ Δ c² / h. But in general, the frequency is higher than Δ c² / h due to the recoil effect.\n\nBut wait, let's check the units. Δ has units of mass, so Δ c² has units of energy. Dividing by h gives units of 1/time, which is correct for frequency. The term (1 + Δ/(2 M)) is dimensionless, so the units are consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be ν = (Δ c² / h)(1 + Δ/(2 M)).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the photon frequency required for an atom to transition from its ground state (mass \\( M \\)) to an excited state (mass \\( M + \\Delta \\)) while conserving energy and momentum, we start by applying relativistic conservation laws.\n\n**Conservation of Momentum:**  \nThe photon's momentum \\( p_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{h\\nu}{c} \\) must equal the atom's momentum after absorption:  \n\\[\n\\gamma (M + \\Delta) v = \\frac{h\\nu}{c}\n\\]\n\n**Conservation of Energy:**  \nThe total energy before absorption (atom's rest energy + photon's energy) equals the total energy after absorption (relativistic energy of the moving atom):  \n\\[\nM c^2 + h\\nu = \\gamma (M + \\Delta) c^2\n\\]\n\n**Relating Velocity and Lorentz Factor:**  \nFrom momentum conservation, solve for \\( v \\):  \n\\[\nv = \\frac{h\\nu}{c \\gamma (M + \\Delta)}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( v \\) into the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \\), and equate the expressions for \\( \\gamma \\) from energy conservation:  \n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{M c^2 + h\\nu}{(M + \\Delta) c^2}\n\\]\n\n**Energy-Momentum Relation:**  \nUsing the relativistic energy-momentum relation \\( E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 \\) for the final state:  \n\\[\n(M c^2 + h\\nu)^2 = (h\\nu c)^2 + (M + \\Delta)^2 c^4\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying leads to:  \n\\[\n2 M c^2 h\\nu = (2 M \\Delta + \\Delta^2) c^4\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\nu \\):  \n\\[\nh\\nu = \\frac{\\Delta c^2 (2 M + \\Delta)}{2 M}\n\\]\n\nThus, the photon frequency is:  \n\\[\n\\nu = \\frac{\\Delta c^2}{h} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta}{2M}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThis result accounts for both the mass increase \\( \\Delta \\) and the recoil kinetic energy of the atom.

{"id": "atomic/1-26", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the degeneracy of the ground state for a hypothetical helium atom where the electrons are replaced by two identical spin-1 particles. Let me start by recalling what I know about the helium atom and how spin and identical particles affect the degeneracy.\n\nFirst, in the real helium atom, the electrons are spin-1/2 fermions, so the Pauli exclusion principle applies. The ground state has the two electrons in the lowest spatial orbital (1s), but since they can't have the same quantum numbers, their spins must be opposite, leading to a singlet state. The total wavefunction is antisymmetric under exchange, so the spatial part is symmetric (since the spin part is antisymmetric). The degeneracy here is 1 because the spin state is uniquely singlet.\n\nBut in this hypothetical case, the particles are spin-1, which are bosons because their spin is integer (1 is integer, so they obey Bose-Einstein statistics). For bosons, the total wavefunction must be symmetric under exchange of the two particles. Since we're neglecting spin-dependent forces, the Hamiltonian doesn't depend on spin, so the spin and spatial parts can be separated. The total wavefunction is a product of spatial and spin parts, and the symmetry of the total wavefunction is the product of the symmetries of each part.\n\nIn the ground state, both particles would occupy the lowest spatial orbital (1s) to minimize energy. Since they are bosons, they can both be in the same spatial state. The spatial wavefunction for both particles in the 1s orbital is symmetric under exchange because swapping them doesn't change anything. So the spatial part is symmetric.\n\nNow, the spin part of the wavefunction must also be symmetric because the total wavefunction has to be symmetric (as bosons). So we need to find the number of symmetric spin states for two spin-1 particles.\n\nEach spin-1 particle has three possible spin states: m_s = -1, 0, +1. When combining two spin-1 particles, the total spin can be S = 2, 1, or 0. The symmetric states correspond to the S = 2 and S = 0 combinations? Wait, no. Wait, when combining two spins, the symmetric states are those with even S. Wait, actually, for two spin-1 particles, the symmetric combination includes all the states with S = 2 and S = 0. Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nThe total number of states for two spin-1 particles is 3 x 3 = 9. The decomposition into total spin states is S=2 (dimension 5), S=1 (dimension 3), and S=0 (dimension 1). But the symmetric states are those where the spin state is symmetric under exchange. The S=2 and S=0 states are symmetric, while the S=1 states are antisymmetric. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, when combining two identical spin-1 particles, the symmetric spin states correspond to even values of S. Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. Let me recall the rules for combining two angular momenta. For two particles with spin j, the total spin can be from 0 to 2j in integer steps. For j=1, total spin S can be 2, 1, 0. The symmetry under exchange depends on the parity of S. For two identical bosons, the spin state must be symmetric if the spatial wavefunction is symmetric. Wait, but in this case, the spatial wavefunction is symmetric (since both are in the same 1s orbital), so the spin wavefunction must also be symmetric. Therefore, the allowed spin states are the symmetric ones. So which of the S=2, S=1, S=0 are symmetric?\n\nThe rule is that for two identical particles with integer spin (bosons), the spin states symmetric under exchange are those with even S. Wait, no, that's for fermions. Wait, no. Wait, when combining two spins, the symmetry of the state under exchange depends on the total spin. For two spin-1 particles, the symmetric states are those with even S? Let me think. For two spin-1 particles, the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition is 3 ⊗ 3 = 5 ⊕ 3 ⊕ 1. The symmetric part is 5 ⊕ 1 (since symmetric states would have dimensions (3*(3+1))/2 = 6, which matches 5 +1 =6). The antisymmetric part is 3. So the symmetric spin states are S=2 (dimension 5) and S=0 (dimension 1). Therefore, the number of symmetric spin states is 5 +1 =6.\n\nTherefore, since the spatial part is symmetric, the spin part must also be symmetric, and there are 6 possible symmetric spin states. Therefore, the total degeneracy of the ground state would be 6.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The spatial wavefunction is symmetric because both particles are in the same orbital (1s), so exchanging them doesn't change the spatial part. Therefore, the spin part must be symmetric. The number of symmetric spin states for two spin-1 particles is 6. Therefore, the degeneracy is 6.\n\nBut wait, in the case of electrons (fermions), the spatial part is symmetric when the spin part is antisymmetric. But here, since the particles are bosons, the total wavefunction must be symmetric. So spatial symmetric times spin symmetric. Since spatial is symmetric, spin must be symmetric. The number of symmetric spin states is 6. Therefore, the degeneracy is 6.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer should be 6. Let me check again. Each spin-1 particle has 3 states. The symmetric combinations are (|m1,m2> + |m2,m1>)/sqrt(2) for m1 ≠ m2, and |m,m> for m = -1,0,1. So how many symmetric states are there? For m1 = m2, there are 3 states (each with m1 = m2). For m1 ≠ m2, the symmetric combinations are (|m1,m2> + |m2,m1>)/sqrt(2). The number of such combinations is C(3,2) = 3. So total symmetric states are 3 + 3 =6. Yes, that's correct. So the spin states contribute a degeneracy of 6. Therefore, the total degeneracy of the ground state is 6.\n\nSo the answer is 6, which would be boxed as \\boxed{6}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the degeneracy of the ground state for a hypothetical helium atom with two identical spin-1 particles (bosons), we analyze the symmetry of the total wavefunction. Since bosons require a symmetric total wavefunction under exchange, and the spatial part is symmetric (both particles occupy the same 1s orbital), the spin part must also be symmetric.\n\nFor two spin-1 particles, the symmetric spin states correspond to total spin \\( S = 2 \\) (dimension 5) and \\( S = 0 \\) (dimension 1). The number of symmetric spin states is calculated by considering all combinations where \\( m_1 = m_2 \\) (3 states) and symmetric combinations for \\( m_1 \\neq m_2 \\) (3 states), totaling 6 symmetric states. Thus, the degeneracy of the ground state is determined by these 6 symmetric spin states.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["6", "6"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "6", "expr2": "6"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "6", "expr2": "6"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "6", "expr2": "6"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "6", "expr2": "6"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/2-37", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the reduction in electrostatic energy when a uranium nucleus splits into two roughly equal parts. Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic concepts. The electrostatic energy of a nucleus is the energy due to the Coulomb repulsion between the protons. When the nucleus splits into two parts, the electrostatic energy should decrease because the charges are now separated into two smaller nuclei, which might have lower overall energy compared to the original larger nucleus. But I need to calculate this properly.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions assuming a uniform charge distribution and gives the nuclear radius formula: R = 1.2 × 10^-13 × A^(1/3) cm, where A is the mass number. Uranium has a high mass number, like uranium-238 maybe? But the exact isotope isn't specified, so I guess I can just keep it as A for the original nucleus. When it splits into two equal parts, each daughter nucleus will have a mass number of A/2. So their radii would be R' = 1.2 × 10^-13 × (A/2)^(1/3) cm. \n\nThe electrostatic (or Coulomb) energy for a uniformly charged sphere is given by the formula U = (3/5) * (k * Q²) / R, where k is Coulomb's constant, Q is the total charge, and R is the radius. So I need to compute the Coulomb energy before and after the split and find the difference.\n\nLet me write down the initial energy first. For the original uranium nucleus, charge Q = Z * e, where Z is the atomic number. For uranium, Z is 92. But maybe the problem wants me to keep it general? Wait, the question says \"estimate,\" so maybe using Z=92 is okay. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps I should keep it symbolic. Hmm. Let's see. The problem says \"estimate the reduction in electrostatic energy of the nuclei.\" So maybe I can express the answer in terms of the original Coulomb energy.\n\nWait, but let's proceed step by step. Let's denote the original nucleus as having charge Q = Z*e and radius R = r0 * A^(1/3), where r0 = 1.2 × 10^-13 cm. Then, when it splits into two equal parts, each daughter nucleus has charge Q/2 and mass number A/2, so radius R' = r0 * (A/2)^(1/3) = R * (1/2)^(1/3) ≈ R / 2^(1/3). \n\nThe initial Coulomb energy is U_initial = (3/5) * (k * Q²) / R. \n\nAfter splitting, each daughter nucleus has Coulomb energy U_daughter = (3/5) * (k * (Q/2)^2) / R'. So the total Coulomb energy of the two daughters is 2 * U_daughter = 2 * (3/5) * (k * Q²/4) / R' = (3/5) * (k Q² / 2) / R'. \n\nBut R' is R divided by 2^(1/3), so substituting R' = R / 2^(1/3), the total energy becomes (3/5) * (k Q² / 2) * 2^(1/3) / R. \n\nTherefore, the final Coulomb energy U_final = (3/5) * (k Q² / 2) * 2^(1/3) / R. \n\nSo the reduction in electrostatic energy is U_initial - U_final. Let's compute that:\n\nΔU = (3/5 k Q² / R) - [ (3/5 k Q² / 2) * 2^(1/3) / R ]\n\nFactor out (3/5 k Q² / R):\n\nΔU = (3/5 k Q² / R) [1 - (2^(1/3)/2)]\n\nSimplify the term in brackets:\n\n2^(1/3)/2 = 2^(1/3 - 1) = 2^(-2/3) = 1/(2^(2/3))\n\nSo 1 - 1/(2^(2/3)) = 1 - 2^(-2/3)\n\nBut 2^(2/3) is the cube root of 4, so 2^(2/3) ≈ 1.5874, so 2^(-2/3) ≈ 0.63. Therefore, 1 - 0.63 ≈ 0.37. So the reduction is about 37% of the original Coulomb energy. But let's do it more precisely.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26, so 2^(1/3)/2 ≈ 1.26/2 ≈ 0.63. Then 1 - 0.63 = 0.37. So ΔU ≈ 0.37 * U_initial. \n\nBut wait, let's check the algebra again. Let me re-express:\n\nU_initial = (3/5)(k Q²)/R\n\nU_final = 2 * (3/5)(k (Q/2)^2)/(R') = 2*(3/5)*(k Q²/4)/(R/2^(1/3)) ) = (3/5)*(k Q²/2)*(2^(1/3)/R)\n\nSo U_final = (3/5 k Q² / R) * (2^(1/3)/2 )\n\nTherefore, ΔU = U_initial - U_final = (3/5 k Q² / R)(1 - 2^(1/3)/2 )\n\nSo the factor is (1 - 2^(1/3)/2 ). Let's compute 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.2599, so 2^(1/3)/2 ≈ 0.62996. Then 1 - 0.62996 ≈ 0.37004. So ΔU ≈ 0.37004 * U_initial. \n\nTherefore, the reduction in electrostatic energy is approximately 37% of the original Coulomb energy. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"estimate the reduction in electrostatic energy of the nuclei. What is the relationship of this to the total change in energy?\" So the first part is to compute ΔU, which is U_initial - U_final. The second part is how this relates to the total energy change. \n\nIn nuclear fission, the total energy released is due to both the reduction in Coulomb energy and the change in the surface energy and other terms in the liquid drop model. The Coulomb energy term is part of the binding energy. When the nucleus splits, the Coulomb energy decreases (which would release energy), but the surface energy increases because you have more surface area with two smaller nuclei. The total change in energy is the sum of these effects. If the reduction in Coulomb energy is larger than the increase in surface energy, then the process is exothermic (releases energy), which is the case for heavy nuclei like uranium. \n\nBut the problem specifically asks about the relationship between the reduction in electrostatic energy and the total change in energy. So the total change in energy (ΔE_total) would be ΔU (reduction in Coulomb) minus the increase in surface energy (ΔE_surface). So ΔE_total = ΔU - ΔE_surface. Since the problem only asks for the relationship, perhaps it's that the reduction in electrostatic energy contributes positively to the total energy change (i.e., energy released), but the actual total energy change is less than ΔU because some energy is used to increase the surface energy. \n\nBut maybe the question is more straightforward. Since the problem says \"estimate the reduction in electrostatic energy\" and then \"what is the relationship of this to the total change in energy?\" So perhaps the answer is that the reduction in electrostatic energy is part of the total energy change, but other factors (like surface energy) also contribute. Therefore, the total energy change is the sum of the reduction in Coulomb energy and the increase in other energy terms (like surface energy). However, in fission, typically the Coulomb energy reduction is the main driver for energy release, but the surface energy term opposes it. For heavy nuclei, the volume and Coulomb terms dominate, so the net is energy release. \n\nBut since the problem is asking specifically about the relationship between the reduction in electrostatic energy and the total change, perhaps the answer is that the reduction in electrostatic energy is the main source of the energy released (total change), but there are other contributions (like surface energy) that reduce the total energy change. So the total energy change is less than the reduction in electrostatic energy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a numerical factor. Let me check the calculation again. Let's compute the exact factor. \n\nOriginal energy: U_initial = (3/5)kQ²/R\n\nAfter splitting, each daughter has energy (3/5)k(Q/2)²/R', so total U_final = 2*(3/5)k(Q²/4)/R' = (3/10)kQ²/R'\n\nBut R' = r0*(A/2)^(1/3) = r0*A^(1/3)*(1/2)^(1/3) = R*(1/2)^(1/3)\n\nTherefore, R' = R / 2^(1/3)\n\nSo U_final = (3/10)kQ² / (R / 2^(1/3)) ) = (3/10)kQ² * 2^(1/3)/R\n\nTherefore, U_final = (3/5)kQ²/R * (2^(1/3)/2 )\n\nSo the ratio U_final / U_initial = (2^(1/3)/2 )\n\nTherefore, the reduction ΔU = U_initial - U_final = U_initial (1 - 2^(1/3)/2 )\n\nCompute 2^(1/3) is approximately 1.2599, so 2^(1/3)/2 ≈ 0.62996\n\nThus, 1 - 0.62996 ≈ 0.37004, so ΔU ≈ 0.370 * U_initial\n\nSo the reduction is approximately 37% of the original Coulomb energy. \n\nBut to write this more precisely, 2^(1/3) is 2^{1/3}, so 1 - 2^{1/3}/2 = 1 - 2^{-2/3} = 1 - 1/(2^{2/3}) = 1 - 2^{-2/3}\n\nAlternatively, 2^{2/3} = (2^{1/3})^2 ≈ (1.2599)^2 ≈ 1.5874, so 1/2^{2/3} ≈ 0.63, so 1 - 0.63 = 0.37. \n\nSo the reduction is about 37% of the original Coulomb energy. \n\nNow, the problem says \"estimate the reduction in electrostatic energy of the nuclei.\" So the answer is that the electrostatic energy is reduced by approximately a factor of 0.37 times the original Coulomb energy. \n\nBut maybe we need to express this in terms of the original Coulomb energy. Let's compute the exact coefficient. \n\nThe original Coulomb energy is U_initial = (3/5)kQ²/R. The reduction is ΔU = U_initial - U_final = U_initial (1 - 2^{-2/3})\n\nSince 2^{-2/3} = (2^{1/3})^{-2} ≈ (1.2599)^{-2} ≈ 1/1.5874 ≈ 0.63, so 1 - 0.63 = 0.37. \n\nAlternatively, 2^{-2/3} = e^{-(2/3) ln 2} ≈ e^{-0.462098} ≈ 0.63, so same result. \n\nTherefore, ΔU ≈ 0.37 U_initial. \n\nBut perhaps we can write it as (1 - 2^{-2/3}) U_initial. \n\nAlternatively, 1 - 2^{-2/3} = 1 - (1/2)^{2/3} = 1 - (2^{-2})^{1/3} = 1 - 2^{-2/3}. \n\nBut maybe the problem expects an exact expression rather than a decimal. So the reduction is (1 - 2^{-2/3}) times the original Coulomb energy. \n\nAlternatively, factor 2^{-2/3} is the same as 1/(2^{2/3}), so 1 - 1/(2^{2/3}) = (2^{2/3} - 1)/2^{2/3}\n\nBut perhaps the answer is better left as 1 - 2^{-2/3} ≈ 0.37. \n\nNow, regarding the second part: \"What is the relationship of this to the total change in energy?\" \n\nIn nuclear fission, the total energy released (the total change in energy) comes from the difference between the binding energy of the original nucleus and the binding energies of the fission fragments. The binding energy has several components in the liquid drop model: volume, surface, Coulomb, asymmetry, and pairing terms. \n\nWhen the nucleus splits, the Coulomb energy decreases (as we calculated), which contributes to a release of energy (since the Coulomb term is repulsive and reducing it lowers the energy). However, the surface energy increases because two smaller nuclei have a larger combined surface area than the original nucleus. The surface term in the binding energy is negative (it contributes to binding), so an increase in surface energy means the binding energy becomes less negative, which is an increase in energy (less binding), hence it's an energy cost. \n\nTherefore, the total change in energy (ΔE_total) is the reduction in Coulomb energy (ΔU) minus the increase in surface energy (ΔE_surface). If ΔU > ΔE_surface, then the total energy change is positive (energy is released). For heavy nuclei like uranium, the reduction in Coulomb energy is larger than the increase in surface energy, so the net result is a release of energy. \n\nTherefore, the relationship is that the reduction in electrostatic energy is a part of the total energy change, but the total energy change also includes the increase in surface energy (and possibly other terms, but surface is the main one here). Hence, the total energy released is less than the reduction in electrostatic energy because some energy is used to increase the surface energy. \n\nBut the problem might be expecting a more concise answer. Since the question is about the relationship between the reduction in electrostatic energy and the total change in energy, the answer is that the reduction in electrostatic energy contributes to the total energy released (ΔE_total), but the total energy change is the reduction in Coulomb energy minus the increase in surface energy. Therefore, the total energy released is less than the reduction in electrostatic energy. \n\nAlternatively, if other terms are negligible, but in reality, the liquid drop model's terms (volume, surface, Coulomb, etc.) all play a role. However, in the case of fission, the volume energy remains roughly the same (since volume is proportional to A, and we have two nuclei each with A/2, so total volume is the same). The surface energy increases, as mentioned. So the main terms are Coulomb and surface. \n\nTherefore, the total energy change is ΔE_total = ΔU_Coulomb - ΔE_surface. Since ΔU_Coulomb is positive (energy released) and ΔE_surface is negative (energy consumed), the total is ΔE_total = ΔU_Coulomb + ( - ΔE_surface ), but I need to be careful with signs. \n\nActually, in the liquid drop model, the binding energy is given by:\n\nB = a_V A - a_S A^{2/3} - a_C Z²/A^{1/3} - a_A (A-2Z)²/A + ...\n\nSo when the nucleus splits into two, the total binding energy of the system changes. The change in binding energy ΔB = B_final - B_initial. If ΔB is positive, it means the final system is more bound (more negative binding energy), but actually, energy released corresponds to the increase in binding energy (more negative). Wait, this can be confusing. \n\nThe binding energy is the energy required to disassemble the nucleus into its constituents. So if the binding energy becomes more negative, the nucleus is more stable. When a heavy nucleus undergoes fission, the total binding energy of the products is higher (more negative) than the original nucleus, which means energy is released. \n\nBut according to the liquid drop model, the change in binding energy would be:\n\nΔB = [2*(a_V (A/2) - a_S (A/2)^{2/3} - a_C (Z/2)^2/(A/2)^{1/3} + ...)] - [a_V A - a_S A^{2/3} - a_C Z²/A^{1/3} + ...]\n\nSimplifying:\n\nΔB = 2a_V (A/2) - 2a_S (A/2)^{2/3} - 2a_C (Z²/4)/(A/2)^{1/3} - [a_V A - a_S A^{2/3} - a_C Z²/A^{1/3}]\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nVolume term: 2a_V (A/2) = a_V A, which cancels with the -a_V A in the original. So volume terms cancel. \n\nSurface term: -2a_S (A/2)^{2/3} = -2a_S A^{2/3} / 2^{2/3} = -2^{1 - 2/3} a_S A^{2/3} = -2^{1/3} a_S A^{2/3}\n\nOriginal surface term: +a_S A^{2/3}\n\nSo surface contribution to ΔB: (-2^{1/3} a_S A^{2/3}) - (-a_S A^{2/3}) )= (-2^{1/3} +1 )a_S A^{2/3}\n\nCoulomb term: -2a_C (Z²/4)/(A/2)^{1/3} = -2a_C Z²/4 * 2^{1/3}/A^{1/3} = - (a_C Z² / 2) * 2^{1/3}/A^{1/3} = - a_C Z² 2^{1/3 -1} / A^{1/3} = - a_C Z² 2^{-2/3}/A^{1/3}\n\nOriginal Coulomb term: +a_C Z² / A^{1/3}\n\nSo Coulomb contribution to ΔB: (-a_C Z² 2^{-2/3}/A^{1/3}) - (-a_C Z² /A^{1/3}) )= a_C Z²/A^{1/3} (1 - 2^{-2/3})\n\nTherefore, the total ΔB = (1 - 2^{-2/3}) a_C Z²/A^{1/3} + (-2^{1/3} +1 )a_S A^{2/3}\n\nBut since binding energy is defined as B = (positive terms) - (negative terms), the actual energy released would be the negative of ΔB if ΔB is negative. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think again. \n\nIn the liquid drop model, the binding energy is a sum of terms. When the nucleus splits, the change in binding energy (ΔB) is B_final - B_initial. If ΔB is positive, it means the final system has higher (more negative) binding energy, so energy is released. \n\nFrom the above calculation:\n\nΔB = [ (1 - 2^{-2/3}) a_C Z²/A^{1/3} ] + [ (1 - 2^{1/3}) a_S A^{2/3} ]\n\nBecause the surface term was (-2^{1/3} +1 )a_S A^{2/3} = (1 - 2^{1/3}) a_S A^{2/3}\n\nSo the Coulomb term contributes positively to ΔB (since 1 - 2^{-2/3} >0) and the surface term contributes negatively (since 1 - 2^{1/3} <0, because 2^{1/3}≈1.26>1). \n\nTherefore, the total change in binding energy is ΔB = (positive Coulomb contribution) + (negative surface contribution). \n\nThe energy released in fission is equal to the increase in binding energy (ΔB), which is positive if the Coulomb term dominates. For heavy nuclei like uranium, this is the case, so ΔB >0, and energy is released. \n\nBut the problem is asking about the relationship between the reduction in electrostatic energy (which is the Coulomb part) and the total change in energy. The total change in energy (released) is ΔB, which includes both the Coulomb and surface terms. Therefore, the reduction in electrostatic energy (which is the Coulomb contribution) is partially offset by the increase in surface energy. Hence, the total energy change is less than the reduction in electrostatic energy alone. \n\nSo the answer to the second part is that the reduction in electrostatic energy contributes positively to the total energy change (i.e., energy release), but the total energy change is less than this reduction because of the opposing increase in surface energy. \n\nTo summarize:\n\n1. The reduction in electrostatic energy is approximately 37% of the original Coulomb energy of the uranium nucleus. \n\n2. This reduction is a major component of the total energy change (release) during fission, but the total energy released is less than the reduction in electrostatic energy because energy is required to increase the surface area of the nuclear fragments. \n\nNow, to put numbers in, maybe we can compute the actual value. Let's take uranium-238, which has Z=92, A=238. \n\nFirst, compute the original Coulomb energy. \n\nU_initial = (3/5) * (k e² Z²) / R\n\nWhere R = 1.2 × 10^-13 cm * A^{1/3} = 1.2 × 10^-13 cm * (238)^{1/3}\n\nCompute 238^{1/3}. 6^3=216, 7^3=343, so 238 is between 6^3 and 7^3. Let's approximate:\n\n6.2^3 = 238.328 ≈ 238. So 238^{1/3} ≈6.2. \n\nTherefore, R ≈1.2 ×10^-13 cm *6.2 ≈7.44 ×10^-13 cm =7.44 ×10^-15 m. \n\nBut units: Coulomb's constant k is 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C². Charge Q=Ze=92*1.6×10^-19 C=1.472×10^-17 C. \n\nSo U_initial = (3/5) * (8.988e9) * (1.472e-17)^2 / (7.44e-15)\n\nCompute numerator: (8.988e9) * (1.472e-17)^2 =8.988e9 * 2.167e-34 ≈1.946e-24\n\nDenominator:7.44e-15\n\nSo U_initial ≈ (3/5) *1.946e-24 /7.44e-15 ≈ (3/5)*2.616e-10 ≈1.569e-10 J\n\nConvert to MeV: 1 eV=1.6e-19 J, so 1 MeV=1.6e-13 J. \n\nSo U_initial ≈1.569e-10 J /1.6e-13 J/MeV ≈980 MeV. \n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check the calculation again. \n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\nFirst, Q=92e=92*1.6e-19 C=1.472e-17 C\n\nk=8.988e9 N·m²/C²\n\nR=1.2e-13 cm * A^(1/3)=1.2e-15 m *6.2=7.44e-15 m\n\nU_initial=(3/5)*(k Q²)/R\n\nCompute Q²=(1.472e-17)^2=2.167e-34 C²\n\nk Q²=8.988e9 *2.167e-34≈1.947e-24 N·m²/C * C²=1.947e-24 N·m²=1.947e-24 J·m\n\nDivide by R=7.44e-15 m:\n\n1.947e-24 /7.44e-15≈2.617e-10 J\n\nMultiply by 3/5: 2.617e-10 *0.6≈1.570e-10 J\n\nConvert to MeV:1.570e-10 J /1.602e-13 J/MeV≈980 MeV. \n\nYes, that's correct. The Coulomb energy of a uranium nucleus is about 980 MeV. \n\nAfter fission, the reduction is 37% of that, so ΔU≈0.37*980≈362 MeV. \n\nBut the actual energy released in uranium fission is around ~200 MeV per fission. So this suggests that the increase in surface energy and possibly other terms account for the difference. \n\nIndeed, the surface energy term would be:\n\nOriginal surface energy: -a_S A^{2/3}\n\nAfter fission: 2*(-a_S (A/2)^{2/3})= -2 a_S (A/2)^{2/3}= -2 a_S A^{2/3} 2^{-2/3}= -2^{1 -2/3} a_S A^{2/3}= -2^{1/3} a_S A^{2/3}\n\nSo the change in surface energy is ΔE_surface = (-2^{1/3} a_S A^{2/3}) - (-a_S A^{2/3})= a_S A^{2/3}(1 -2^{1/3})\n\nSince 2^{1/3}≈1.26, 1 -2^{1/3}≈-0.26, so ΔE_surface≈-0.26 a_S A^{2/3}\n\nThe surface term is negative in the binding energy, so the change in surface energy (ΔE_surface) is negative, meaning the surface energy becomes more negative (more binding) or less? Wait, original surface energy is -a_S A^{2/3}, and after fission it's -2^{1/3} a_S A^{2/3}. So the surface energy becomes more negative (more binding) if 2^{1/3} >1, which it is. Wait, no: the surface energy term in binding energy is negative, so a larger negative value means less binding (since binding energy is defined as positive terms minus negative terms). Wait, no: the binding energy formula is B = a_V A - a_S A^{2/3} - ... So the surface term is subtracted. If the surface term increases (becomes larger in magnitude), then the binding energy decreases (becomes less positive or more negative). Wait, this is confusing. \n\nLet me clarify. The surface energy term in the binding energy is -a_S A^{2/3}. When the nucleus splits, the total surface term becomes -a_S (2*(A/2)^{2/3}) = -a_S 2^{1 - 2/3} A^{2/3} = -a_S 2^{1/3} A^{2/3}. So the surface term becomes more negative (since 2^{1/3} >1). Therefore, the binding energy decreases because you're subtracting a larger surface term. Wait, no: the binding energy is B = +a_V A -a_S A^{2/3} - ... So if the surface term becomes more negative (i.e., -a_S A^{2/3} becomes -a_S 2^{1/3} A^{2/3}), then the total binding energy becomes B = ... -a_S 2^{1/3} A^{2/3} ..., which is a lower binding energy (less positive or more negative). \n\nBut in terms of energy release, if the binding energy becomes more negative (more bound), that means energy is released. Wait, no: if the binding energy increases (more negative), that means the nucleus is more stable, and the energy released is the difference. \n\nBut in this case, the surface term after fission is more negative, which would mean the binding energy is lower (more negative), implying more energy is released. But this contradicts our previous conclusion. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the signs. Let's think carefully. \n\nThe binding energy (B) is the energy required to break the nucleus into its constituents. A higher (more positive) B means the nucleus is less tightly bound. A more negative B means more tightly bound. \n\nBut in the liquid drop model, B is given as a positive number for stable nuclei. Wait, no: actually, the binding energy is defined as a positive quantity, the energy required to disassemble the nucleus. So a larger B means more energy is needed to break it apart, hence more stable. \n\nBut in the formula, B = a_V A - a_S A^{2/3} - a_C Z²/A^{1/3} - ... \n\nSo when the surface term increases (in magnitude), the binding energy B decreases, meaning the nucleus is less tightly bound. \n\nTherefore, when the nucleus splits, the surface term becomes more negative (because 2*(A/2)^{2/3} =2^{1 -2/3} A^{2/3}=2^{1/3} A^{2/3}), so the surface term is -a_S 2^{1/3} A^{2/3}, which is more negative than the original -a_S A^{2/3}. Therefore, the binding energy decreases by (a_S A^{2/3}(2^{1/3} -1)), which means the nucleus is less bound, which requires energy input. \n\nTherefore, the change in surface energy (ΔE_surface) is negative (since B_final - B_initial = [ -a_S 2^{1/3} A^{2/3} ] - [ -a_S A^{2/3} ]) = a_S A^{2/3}(1 -2^{1/3}) ≈ -0.26 a_S A^{2/3}\n\nSo this is a negative change in binding energy, meaning the binding energy decreases (becomes less positive), which corresponds to an energy cost (energy must be supplied). \n\nTherefore, the total energy change is ΔB = ΔU_Coulomb + ΔE_surface = (positive) + (negative). So the net energy release is ΔB = (1 -2^{-2/3}) a_C Z²/A^{1/3} + (1 -2^{1/3}) a_S A^{2/3}\n\nFor uranium, the Coulomb term dominates, so ΔB is positive, leading to net energy release. \n\nBut the problem asks for the relationship between the reduction in electrostatic energy (ΔU) and the total change in energy (ΔB). So ΔB = ΔU + ΔE_surface (since ΔU is positive and ΔE_surface is negative). Therefore, the total energy change is less than the reduction in electrostatic energy because some of that reduction is offset by the increase in surface energy. \n\nSo the answer is:\n\nThe reduction in electrostatic energy is approximately 37% of the original Coulomb energy. The total change in energy is this reduction minus the increase in surface energy, so the total energy released is less than the reduction in electrostatic energy. \n\nBut to put numbers in, for uranium-238, the Coulomb energy reduction is ~362 MeV, but the actual energy released is ~200 MeV, implying that the surface energy increase is ~162 MeV. \n\nBut the problem doesn't ask for numerical values, just the relationship. \n\nSo, final answers:\n\n1. The reduction in electrostatic energy is approximately (1 - 2^{-2/3}) times the original Coulomb energy, which is about 37% of U_initial. \n\n2. This reduction contributes to the total energy change, but the total energy released is less than the reduction in electrostatic energy because energy is consumed in increasing the surface energy of the fission fragments. \n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\nReduction in electrostatic energy: ΔU = (1 - 2^{-2/3}) U_initial ≈ 0.37 U_initial\n\nRelationship: The total energy change (release) is the reduction in electrostatic energy minus the increase in surface energy, hence less than ΔU. \n\nBut the problem asks to \"estimate the reduction in electrostatic energy of the nuclei. What is the relationship of this to the total change in energy?\"\n\nSo the first part is the factor (1 - 2^{-2/3}) times the original Coulomb energy. The second part is that the total energy change is the reduction in electrostatic energy minus the increase in surface energy, so the total is less than the reduction in Coulomb energy. \n\nBut since the problem says \"estimate,\" maybe we can express the reduction factor as 2^{-2/3} or 1 - 2^{-2/3}, and state the relationship. \n\nAlternatively, using the given radius formula, compute the numerical factor. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect the ratio of the final Coulomb energy to the initial, but I think the way I did it is correct. \n\nSo, to box the answers:\n\nThe reduction in electrostatic energy is approximately \\boxed{0.37} times the original Coulomb energy. The total energy change is this reduction minus the increase in surface energy, resulting in a net energy release less than the electrostatic energy reduction.\n\nBut the problem might want the reduction expressed as a formula. Since the original Coulomb energy is U_initial = (3/5)(k Q²)/R, and the reduction is ΔU = (1 - 2^{-2/3}) U_initial, which can be written as:\n\nΔU = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2^{2/3}}\\right) U_{\\text{initial}}\n\nOr in terms of the original parameters, but since the problem asks to estimate, maybe the numerical factor is sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, since 2^{2/3} is the cube root of 4, so 1 - 1/2^{2/3} = 1 - 4^{-1/3}\n\nBut perhaps the answer is expected to be expressed as a fraction. \n\nAlternatively, the exact expression is (1 - 2^{-2/3}), which is approximately 0.37. \n\nFor the relationship, the total energy change is the electrostatic reduction minus the surface energy increase, so the total energy released is less than the electrostatic energy reduction. \n\nBut the problem might want a concise answer. \n\nSo final answers:\n\nReduction in electrostatic energy: \\boxed{ \\left(1 - 2^{-2/3}\\right) U_{\\text{initial}} }\n\nRelationship: The total energy change is the reduction in electrostatic energy minus the increase in surface energy, hence less than the electrostatic reduction.\n</think>\n\nThe reduction in electrostatic energy when a uranium nucleus splits into two roughly equal parts can be estimated by comparing the Coulomb energy before and after the split. \n\n1. **Reduction in Electrostatic Energy**:\n   - The initial Coulomb energy of the uranium nucleus is given by:\n     \\[\n     U_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{3}{5} \\frac{k Q^2}{R}\n     \\]\n     where \\( Q = Ze \\), \\( R = 1.2 \\times 10^{-13} A^{1/3} \\, \\text{cm} \\), and \\( k \\) is Coulomb's constant.\n   - After splitting, each daughter nucleus has charge \\( Q/2 \\) and radius \\( R' = R / 2^{1/3} \\). The total Coulomb energy of the two daughters is:\n     \\[\n     U_{\\text{final}} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} \\frac{k (Q/2)^2}{R'} = \\frac{3}{5} \\frac{k Q^2}{R} \\cdot \\frac{2^{1/3}}{2}\n     \\]\n   - The reduction in electrostatic energy is:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta U = U_{\\text{initial}} - U_{\\text{final}} = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2^{2/3}}\\right) U_{\\text{initial}}\n     \\]\n     Numerically, \\( 1 - 2^{-2/3} \\approx 0.37 \\), so the reduction is approximately **37%** of the original Coulomb energy.\n\n2. **Relationship to Total Energy Change**:\n   - The total energy change during fission includes both the reduction in Coulomb energy and the increase in surface energy. The surface energy increases because two smaller nuclei have a larger combined surface area, which opposes the energy release.\n   - The total energy released is the reduction in Coulomb energy minus the increase in surface energy. Hence, the total energy change is **less than the reduction in electrostatic energy** due to the energy cost of increasing the surface energy.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe reduction in electrostatic energy is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\left(1 - 2^{-2/3}\\right) U_{\\text{initial}}}\n\\]\nThe total energy change is less than this reduction due to the opposing increase in surface energy.", "final_answers": ["0.37", "\\left(1 - 2^{-2/3}\\right) U_{\\text{initial}}", "\\left(1 - 2^{-2/3}\\right) U_{\\text{initial}}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "0.37", "expr2": "364 \\ \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\left(1 - 2^{-2/3}\\right) U_{\\text{initial}}", "expr2": "364 \\ \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\left(1 - 2^{-2/3}\\right) U_{\\text{initial}}", "expr2": "364 \\ \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-28", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which of the options (a), (b), or (c) is responsible for the fine structure of atomic spectral lines. Let me start by recalling what I know about fine structure.\n\nFine structure refers to the small splitting or shifts in the spectral lines of atoms. I remember that these are due to relativistic effects, but I'm not exactly sure which specific effect. Wait, the main contributors to fine structure are the relativistic corrections to the kinetic energy of the electron, the spin-orbit coupling, and maybe some other terms like the Darwin term. But among the options given here, the choices are electron spin-orbit coupling, interaction between electron and nucleus, and nuclear spin.\n\nOption (a) is electron spin-orbit coupling. Spin-orbit coupling is the interaction between the electron's spin and its orbital motion. This definitely causes a splitting in energy levels, leading to fine structure. I think that's a key part of the fine structure. But wait, isn't the spin-orbit effect part of the relativistic corrections? Or is it a separate effect?\n\nOption (b) is interaction between electron and nucleus. But isn't that the basic Coulomb interaction that's already accounted for in the hydrogen atom's energy levels according to the Bohr model or the Schrödinger equation? The main energy levels come from the electrostatic attraction between the electron and nucleus. So maybe that's not the cause of the fine structure, which is a smaller correction. Unless the question is referring to some other interaction here. But the standard answer for fine structure usually includes spin-orbit coupling.\n\nOption (c) is nuclear spin. Nuclear spin is more related to hyperfine structure, not fine structure. Hyperfine structure comes from the interaction between the electron's magnetic moment and the nuclear magnetic moment, leading to even smaller splittings, like the 21 cm line in hydrogen. So nuclear spin would be hyperfine, not fine structure. So (c) is probably not the answer.\n\nSo putting it together: Fine structure arises mainly from relativistic effects, including spin-orbit coupling. The primary effect here is the spin-orbit interaction, which is option (a). The interaction between electron and nucleus (option b) is the main Coulomb interaction, which is already considered in the gross structure. Nuclear spin (option c) is hyperfine. Therefore, the correct answer should be (a).\n</think>\n\nThe fine structure of atomic spectral lines arises from relativistic corrections, with the primary contributor being the spin-orbit coupling. This interaction occurs between the electron's spin magnetic moment and the magnetic field generated by its orbital motion around the nucleus. While the Coulomb interaction between the electron and nucleus (option b) determines the gross structure of energy levels, it does not account for the fine splitting. Nuclear spin (option c) is associated with hyperfine structure, which involves even smaller energy shifts. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(a)}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["(a)"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "(a)", "expr2": "(a)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "a", "expr2": "a"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/2-30", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The question is about constructing an energy-versus-separation plot for nuclear fission and relating it to the liquid-drop model. Hmm, I remember that the liquid-drop model treats the nucleus as a drop of incompressible nuclear fluid. This model explains nuclear fission by considering the balance between the surface tension and Coulomb repulsion. \n\nSo, for the energy vs. separation plot, I think the x-axis would be the separation between the two fragments, and the y-axis is the potential energy. Initially, when the nucleus is intact, the separation is zero, and the energy is at a certain value. As the nucleus starts to deform, the separation increases. The energy probably first increases because you have to overcome the binding energy—like stretching the nucleus increases surface energy due to the surface tension term in the liquid-drop model. But then, after a certain point, the Coulomb repulsion between the protons in the two fragments becomes stronger than the surface tension holding them together. So the energy would reach a maximum (the activation energy or fission barrier) and then decrease as the fragments move apart, releasing energy.\n\nThe plot should show a potential barrier. The original nucleus is in a metastable state. To undergo fission, it needs to overcome this barrier. The liquid-drop model's terms like surface energy (which holds the nucleus together) and Coulomb energy (which tries to break it apart) contribute to this barrier. At small deformations, surface tension dominates, so energy increases. But as the nucleus elongates, the Coulomb repulsion becomes more significant, leading to a decrease in energy once the barrier is crossed. So the features of the plot—the initial rise and then fall—are directly related to the competition between these two terms in the liquid-drop model.\n\nMoving to part (b): Where does the energy released in fission come from? I recall that when a heavy nucleus like uranium splits into two lighter nuclei, the total binding energy of the system increases. The binding energy per nucleon is lower for heavy nuclei beyond iron, so splitting them into medium-mass nuclei (closer to iron) releases energy because the products are more tightly bound. The energy released is the difference in binding energy between the original nucleus and the fission products. So the energy comes from the conversion of mass into energy via Einstein's E=mc², where the mass defect (difference in mass before and after) corresponds to the energy released.\n\nFor part (c): Why don't elements heavier than iron but lighter than lead fission spontaneously? Wait, elements heavier than iron have higher binding energy per nucleon than iron, but up to a point. Wait, no—the binding energy per nucleon peaks around iron. So elements heavier than iron have lower binding energy per nucleon. But why don't those between iron and lead fission? Because even though their binding energy is less than iron, the process of fission would require them to split into lighter elements, but maybe the Coulomb barrier is too high for spontaneous fission. Alternatively, maybe the energy released isn't sufficient to overcome the activation energy for fission. For elements heavier than lead (like uranium), the Coulomb repulsion is so strong that the fission barrier is lower, making spontaneous fission more probable, albeit still rare. For elements between iron and lead, the binding energy difference might not be enough to make fission energetically favorable. Wait, but fission of elements heavier than iron should release energy. However, the activation energy required (the height of the fission barrier) might be too high for them to undergo fission spontaneously. So even though fission is energetically favorable (exothermic), the probability of tunneling through the barrier is extremely low at normal conditions. Hence, they don't fission spontaneously because the energy barrier is too high, making the process extremely slow unless additional energy is provided (like neutron absorption in induced fission).\n</think>\n\n(a) The energy-versus-separation plot for nuclear fission shows potential energy as a function of the distance between two fission fragments. Initially, as the nucleus deforms (separation increases), the energy rises due to the dominance of the surface tension term from the liquid-drop model, which resists deformation. This creates a potential barrier. Beyond a critical separation, Coulomb repulsion between the fragments overcomes the surface tension, causing the energy to decrease as the fragments move apart. The liquid-drop model explains this behavior: the surface energy stabilizes the nucleus at small deformations, while Coulomb energy drives fission once the barrier is overcome. The plot’s peak corresponds to the fission barrier height, determining the likelihood of spontaneous fission.\n\n(b) The energy released in fission originates from the difference in binding energy between the original heavy nucleus and the fission products. Heavy nuclei (e.g., uranium) have lower binding energy per nucleon compared to medium-mass nuclei near iron. When they split, the total binding energy increases, converting mass defect into energy via \\( E = \\Delta m c^2 \\).\n\n(c) Elements heavier than iron but lighter than lead do not fission spontaneously because the energy released from splitting them is insufficient to overcome the high fission barrier. While fission is energetically favorable (exothermic), the activation energy required to deform the nucleus into a critical configuration is too large at normal conditions. Thus, the probability of tunneling through the barrier is negligible without external energy input (e.g., neutron-induced fission).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) Energy rises due to surface tension, then falls due to Coulomb repulsion.} \\\\\n&\\text{(b) Binding energy difference converted to energy via } E = \\Delta m c^2. \\\\\n&\\text{(c) High fission barrier prevents spontaneous fission despite exothermicity.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) Energy rises due to surface tension, then falls due to Coulomb repulsion.} \\\\\n&\\text{(b) Binding energy difference converted to energy via } E = \\Delta m c^2. \\\\\n&\\text{(c) High fission barrier prevents spontaneous fission despite exothermicity.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) Energy rises due to surface tension, then falls due to Coulomb repulsion.} \\\\\n&\\text{(b) Binding energy difference converted to energy via } E = \\Delta m c^2. \\\\\n&\\text{(c) High fission barrier prevents spontaneous fission despite exothermicity.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{The energy-versus-separation plot shows that as nuclear mass number } A \\text{ increases, binding energy per nucleon } \\varepsilon \\text{ reaches a broad maximum and then decreases.

{"id": "atomic/1-17", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, part (a) asks for the differential cross section for Rutherford scattering. I remember that Rutherford scattering formula relates to the scattering of charged particles by a Coulomb potential. The formula involves the charges of the projectile and target, the energy of the projectile, and the scattering angle. Let me recall the exact expression.\n\nThe differential cross section for Rutherford scattering is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left( \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{4 \\epsilon_0 (2E)} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{\\sin^4(\\theta/2)}\n\\]\n\nWait, but maybe the energy term is related to momentum? Alternatively, another version I remember is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left( \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 \\alpha \\hbar c}{4 E \\sin^2(\\theta/2)} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nBut units might be tricky here. Let me check the dimensions. The cross section should be in cm²/sr. Let's see: if E is energy, then the denominator has E², and the numerator has (e²/(4πε₀))². But maybe using the classical formula where kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Alternatively, the correct formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left( \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{8 \\pi \\epsilon_0 E} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{\\sin^4(\\theta/2)}\n\\]\n\nBut I need to make sure the dependencies are correct. The cross section should depend on Z² (since both projectile and target charges are involved), inversely on the square of energy, and 1/sin⁴(θ/2). Let me confirm. Rutherford scattering cross section is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left( \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{16 \\pi \\epsilon_0 E} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{\\sin^4(\\theta/2)}\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems right. Here, E is the kinetic energy of the projectile. The units: e²/(ε₀ E) should give appropriate units for cross section. But maybe in terms of MeV and other constants, I need to convert units properly. However, since part (a) just asks to write down the formula, I'll proceed with this expression. So, the differential cross section has Z₁ and Z₂ (charge numbers of projectile and target), inversely proportional to the square of energy, and 1/sin⁴(θ/2). The dimensions would be in cm²/sr if all constants are in appropriate units. Let's note that for protons, Z₁=1, and for Aluminum, Z₂=13. So, moving to part (b).\n\nBut wait, the problem states that in part (a), if I don't remember, I can make a best guess. But since I think the formula is as above, I'll use that. Let me check once more. Another version might use the momentum p instead of energy. Since E = (pc)²/(2m) for non-relativistic? Wait, the given momentum is 200 MeV/c. Let's see, protons with 200 MeV/c momentum. The kinetic energy would be E = p²/(2m), but if the momentum is given in MeV/c, then m is proton mass, which is about 938 MeV/c². So, E = (200)^2 / (2*938) ≈ 40000 / 1876 ≈ 21.3 MeV. But maybe relativistic effects are important? Wait, 200 MeV/c is the momentum. For protons, when the momentum is much less than mc² (which is 938 MeV), non-relativistic is okay. But 200 is about 1/5 of 938, so maybe relativistic corrections are needed. But perhaps the problem uses non-relativistic formulas. However, for Rutherford scattering, the formula is classical, so maybe energy is kinetic energy. But in part (b), we need to compute the cross section using the given momentum. Wait, the beam has 200 MeV/c momentum. So, perhaps the energy in the formula is related to the kinetic energy. Let me compute the kinetic energy first.\n\nProton rest mass m = 938 MeV/c². Momentum p = 200 MeV/c. The total energy is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ) = sqrt( (200)^2 + (938)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(40000 + 880, 000) ≈ sqrt(920,000) ≈ 959 MeV. So kinetic energy E = total energy - rest energy = 959 - 938 ≈ 21 MeV. So, E ≈ 21 MeV. So, in the cross section formula, E is 21 MeV. But in the formula, the cross section is proportional to (Z₁ Z₂ e² / ( ... E ))^2. So, substituting Z₁=1 (proton), Z₂=13 (Aluminum), E=21 MeV, angle θ=30°, compute dσ/dΩ in cm²/sr.\n\nBut first, let's make sure the constants are in the right units. The term e²/(4πε₀) in units that convert to MeV·cm. Let's recall that e²/(4πε₀) ≈ 1.44 MeV·fm, where 1 fm = 1e-13 cm. So, 1.44 MeV·fm = 1.44e-13 MeV·cm. But in the formula, we have (Z₁ Z₂ e²/(8πε₀ E))². Wait, perhaps the formula is written as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left( \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{8 \\pi \\epsilon_0 E} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{\\sin^4(\\theta/2)}\n\\]\n\nBut let's check the exact formula. The standard Rutherford scattering formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left( \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{16 \\pi \\epsilon_0 E} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{\\sin^4(\\theta/2)}\n\\]\n\nWait, different sources might have factors. Let me check. From Wikipedia: The differential cross section is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left( \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{8 \\pi \\epsilon_0 E} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{\\sin^4(\\theta/2)}\n\\]\n\nBut I need to confirm. Let's derive it quickly. The Rutherford formula comes from the Coulomb scattering. The impact parameter b related to the scattering angle θ is given by:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{8 \\pi \\epsilon_0 E} \\cot(\\theta/2)\n\\]\n\nThen, the differential cross section is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left( \\frac{b}{\\sin \\theta} \\right)^2 \\frac{db}{d\\theta}\n\\]\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The cross section is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 E} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{\\sin^4(\\theta/2)}\n\\]\n\nHmm, conflicting factors. Let me check a textbook. In Rutherford scattering, the differential cross section is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left( \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 \\alpha \\hbar c}{4 E \\sin^2(\\theta/2)} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nWhere α is the fine structure constant, approximately 1/137. But this might be another form. Let's see: α = e²/(4πε₀ ℏ c). So substituting back, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left( \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{4 \\epsilon_0 E \\sin^2(\\theta/2)} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{4 \\pi \\hbar c} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating. Let me use the formula from the classical derivation. The correct formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left( \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{16 \\pi \\epsilon_0 E} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{\\sin^4(\\theta/2)}\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems right. Let's confirm the units. e²/(ε₀ E) has units of (C²·m²/N·m²) / (J) → (C²·m²)/(C²/N·m² * N·m) ) → (m²)/(m) → m. Wait, maybe not. Let's compute e²/(4πε₀) in units of MeV·fm. As I mentioned earlier, e²/(4πε₀) ≈ 1.44 MeV·fm. So, if we have (Z₁ Z₂ * 1.44 MeV·fm) / (E * 16 π) )² / sin⁴(θ/2). Then, the cross section would be in (MeV·fm / MeV)^2 = (fm)^2. Then, convert fm² to cm². 1 fm = 1e-13 cm, so 1 fm² = 1e-26 cm². But the answer needs to be in cm²/sr. So, the formula would give dσ/dΩ in fm²/sr, then convert to cm²/sr by multiplying by 1e-26.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is written with factors to get the correct units. Let me proceed with the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left( \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{16 \\pi \\epsilon_0 E} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{\\sin^4(\\theta/2)}\n\\]\n\nAssuming E is in MeV, and e²/(4πε₀) is 1.44 MeV·fm. Then, substituting:\n\nNumerator: Z₁ Z₂ * 1.44 MeV·fm\n\nDenominator: 16 π E (MeV)\n\nSo, the term inside the square is (1.44 * Z₁ Z₂) / (16 π E) ) * fm\n\nThen, squaring gives ( (1.44 Z₁ Z₂ / (16 π E))^2 ) * fm²\n\nConvert fm² to cm²: 1 fm² = 1e-26 cm²\n\nSo, overall:\n\ndσ/dΩ = ( (1.44)^2 * Z₁² Z₂² ) / ( (16 π)^2 E² ) ) * 1e-26 / sin⁴(θ/2) cm²/sr\n\nLet me compute the constants:\n\n1.44² = 2.0736\n\n(16 π)^2 = (50.265)^2 ≈ 2526.96\n\nSo, 2.0736 / 2526.96 ≈ 0.000820\n\nThen, the constant term is 0.000820 * 1e-26 = 8.20e-30 cm²·MeV²/(sr)\n\nWait, but the formula has Z₁² Z₂² / E². So, putting it all together:\n\ndσ/dΩ = 8.20e-30 * (Z₁ Z₂ / E)^2 / sin⁴(θ/2) cm²/sr\n\nBut wait, the units here: E is in MeV, so (Z₁ Z₂ / E)^2 is (unitless/MeV)^2, and the constant has cm²·MeV², so overall cm²/sr. That works.\n\nSo, substituting Z₁=1 (proton), Z₂=13 (Al), E=21 MeV (from earlier calculation), θ=30°.\n\nFirst, compute sin(θ/2): θ=30°, so θ/2=15°, sin(15°)=0.2588\n\nsin⁴(15°)= (0.2588)^4 ≈ 0.00445\n\nThen, (Z₁ Z₂ / E)^2 = (1*13 / 21)^2 ≈ (0.619)^2 ≈ 0.383\n\nMultiply by 8.20e-30 / 0.00445:\n\n8.20e-30 * 0.383 / 0.00445 ≈ (8.20e-30 * 86.1) ≈ 7.06e-28 cm²/sr\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\nFirst, compute the numerator: 8.20e-30 * (13/21)^2 = 8.20e-30 * (0.6190)^2 ≈ 8.20e-30 * 0.383 ≈ 3.14e-30\n\nThen divide by sin⁴(15°)=0.00445:\n\n3.14e-30 / 0.00445 ≈ 7.06e-28 cm²/sr\n\nSo, part (b) answer is approximately 7.06e-28 cm²/sr. But let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, the constant term was 8.20e-30 cm²·MeV²/(sr) * (Z₁ Z₂)^2 / E² / sin⁴(θ/2)\n\nWait, no, the formula is:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (1.44^2 * Z₁² Z₂²) / ( (16 π E)^2 ) * 1e-26 / sin⁴(θ/2) cm²/sr\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the constants. Let's re-express the formula properly.\n\nStarting from:\n\ndσ/dΩ = [ (Z₁ Z₂ e² ) / (16 π ε₀ E ) ]² * 1 / sin⁴(θ/2)\n\nWe know that e²/(4πε₀) = 1.44 MeV·fm, so e²/(4πε₀) = 1.44 MeV·fm. Therefore, e²/(16 π ε₀) = (1/4) * e²/(4 π ε₀) = 1.44 / 4 = 0.36 MeV·fm.\n\nThus, the term inside the brackets becomes (Z₁ Z₂ * 0.36 MeV·fm) / (E) )\n\nSo, squared: (Z₁ Z₂ * 0.36 / E )² * fm²\n\nConvert fm² to cm²: 1 fm² = 1e-26 cm²\n\nThus, dσ/dΩ = (0.36 Z₁ Z₂ / E )² * 1e-26 / sin⁴(θ/2) cm²/sr\n\nCompute (0.36)^2 = 0.1296\n\nSo, dσ/dΩ = 0.1296 * (Z₁ Z₂ / E )² * 1e-26 / sin⁴(θ/2) cm²/sr\n\nNow plugging in Z₁=1, Z₂=13, E=21 MeV, θ=30°:\n\n(1*13 /21 )² = (13/21)^2 ≈ (0.6190)^2 ≈ 0.383\n\nsin(15°)=0.2588, so sin⁴(15°)= (0.2588)^4 ≈ 0.00445\n\nThus:\n\ndσ/dΩ = 0.1296 * 0.383 * 1e-26 / 0.00445 ≈ 0.1296 * 0.383 ≈ 0.0496; 0.0496 / 0.00445 ≈ 11.15; 11.15 * 1e-26 ≈ 1.115e-25 cm²/sr\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, this gives approximately 1.12e-25 cm²/sr. Hmm, conflicting results. Where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nAh, I think the mistake was in the initial conversion. Let's clarify:\n\nThe term e²/(4πε₀) = 1.44 MeV·fm. Therefore, e²/(16 π ε₀ E) = (1.44 MeV·fm) / (4 * E). So, (Z₁ Z₂ * 1.44 / (4 E))² * fm² / sin⁴(θ/2)\n\nThen, (1.44 / 4) = 0.36, so (Z₁ Z₂ * 0.36 / E )² * fm² / sin⁴(θ/2)\n\nConvert fm² to cm²: 1 fm² = 1e-26 cm²\n\nThus, the formula becomes:\n\ndσ/dΩ = (0.36 Z₁ Z₂ / E )² * 1e-26 / sin⁴(θ/2) cm²/sr\n\nSo, 0.36² = 0.1296, as before. Then:\n\n0.1296 * (13/21)^2 * 1e-26 / 0.00445 ≈ 0.1296 * 0.383 * 1e-26 / 0.00445\n\nCompute numerator: 0.1296 * 0.383 ≈ 0.0496\n\n0.0496 / 0.00445 ≈ 11.15\n\n11.15 * 1e-26 = 1.115e-25 cm²/sr\n\nSo, approximately 1.12e-25 cm²/sr for part (b). That seems more accurate. So, the answer is around 1.1e-25 cm²/sr.\n\nMoving to part (c): Number of protons per second entering a 1-cm radius counter at 2 meters and 30°.\n\nFirst, the differential cross section gives the probability per nucleus per steradian. The number of scattered protons is given by:\n\nN = N_beam * n_target * dσ/dΩ * ΔΩ\n\nWhere N_beam is the beam intensity (10^12 protons/s), n_target is the number of target nuclei per cm², ΔΩ is the solid angle of the detector.\n\nFirst, compute n_target: the target is the aluminum window with thickness 0.01 cm. The density is 2.7 g/cm³. The radiation length is given but probably not needed here. The number of nuclei per cm² is:\n\nn_target = (density * thickness) * (Avogadro's number) / (A * molar mass)\n\nWait, density ρ = 2.7 g/cm³, thickness t = 0.01 cm. So, mass per cm² is ρ*t = 2.7 * 0.01 = 0.027 g/cm².\n\nNumber of moles per cm²: 0.027 g/cm² / 27 g/mol = 0.001 mol/cm².\n\nNumber of atoms per cm²: 0.001 mol/cm² * 6.022e23 atoms/mol = 6.022e20 atoms/cm².\n\nSo, n_target = 6.022e20 nuclei/cm².\n\nThen, the solid angle ΔΩ for a circular detector of radius r = 1 cm at distance R = 2 meters = 200 cm. The solid angle is approximately:\n\nΔΩ = π r² / R² = π (1)^2 / (200)^2 = π / 40000 ≈ 7.85e-5 sr.\n\nBut wait, the angle θ is 30°, so the detector is placed at 30°, but the solid angle element in Rutherford scattering is dΩ = 2π sinθ dθ dφ. However, the problem states that the counter is at a distance of 2 meters and at an angle of 30°, with a 1-cm radius. Assuming small angle approximation for the solid angle, but since the radius is 1 cm at 200 cm, the angular half-width is Δθ ≈ r/R = 1/200 = 0.005 radians. But since the angle θ is 30°, which is not small, the actual solid angle is approximately the area of the detector divided by R², which is π*(1 cm)^2 / (200 cm)^2 = π/40000 ≈ 7.85e-5 sr, as before. However, this assumes that the detector is placed perpendicular to the line of sight from the target. But at 30°, the actual solid angle might be slightly different due to the angle, but for small detectors, the approximation holds. So, ΔΩ ≈ 7.85e-5 sr.\n\nThus, the number of protons per second is:\n\nN = 1e12 * 6.022e20 * (1.12e-25) * 7.85e-5\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n1e12 * 6.022e20 = 6.022e32\n\n6.022e32 * 1.12e-25 = 6.022 * 1.12e7 = 6.75e7\n\n6.75e7 * 7.85e-5 ≈ 6.75e7 * 7.85e-5 ≈ 5.30e3 protons/s\n\nSo, approximately 5.3e3 protons per second. But let me check the calculation again:\n\n1e12 (beam) * 6.022e20 (nuclei/cm²) = 6.022e32 interactions/(cm²·s)\n\nMultiply by dσ/dΩ (1.12e-25 cm²/sr) gives 6.022e32 * 1.12e-25 = 6.746e7 per sr·s\n\nMultiply by ΔΩ (7.85e-5 sr): 6.746e7 * 7.85e-5 ≈ 5.3e3 per second.\n\nSo, part (c) answer is approximately 5.3e3 protons/s.\n\nPart (d): Integrated cross section for angles >5°. The hint gives sinθ dθ = 4 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) d(θ/2). Let's use that substitution.\n\nThe integrated cross section is:\n\nσ = ∫ (dσ/dΩ) dΩ\n\nWhere dΩ = 2π sinθ dθ. The integration is from θ=5° to θ=180°.\n\nUsing the substitution: sinθ dθ = 4 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) d(θ/2). Let x = θ/2, so dx = dθ/2, so dθ = 2 dx. Then, sinθ dθ = 4 sin x cos x * 2 dx = 8 sin x cos x dx. Wait, maybe the hint is suggesting sinθ dθ = 4 sin(x) cos(x) dx where x=θ/2. Let me check:\n\nsinθ = 2 sin(x) cos(x), where x=θ/2. So, sinθ dθ = 2 sin(x) cos(x) dθ. But if x=θ/2, then dθ = 2 dx. So, sinθ dθ = 2 sin(x) cos(x) * 2 dx = 4 sin(x) cos(x) dx. Yes, that's the hint.\n\nSo, substituting into the integral:\n\nσ = ∫ (dσ/dΩ) * 2π sinθ dθ\n\n= ∫_{5°}^{180°} [ (0.36 Z₁ Z₂ / E )² * 1e-26 / sin⁴(x) ] * 2π * 4 sin x cos x dx\n\nWait, let's substitute x = θ/2. Then, θ ranges from 5° to 180°, so x ranges from 2.5° to 90°, which is 2.5° to π/2 radians.\n\nExpressing the integral in terms of x:\n\nσ = ∫_{x=2.5°}^{x=90°} [ (0.36 Z₁ Z₂ / E )² * 1e-26 / sin⁴(x) ] * 2π * 4 sin x cos x dx\n\nSimplify the integrand:\n\n= (0.36 Z₁ Z₂ / E )² * 1e-26 * 2π * 4 ∫ [ sin x cos x / sin⁴ x ] dx\n\n= (0.36 Z₁ Z₂ / E )² * 1e-26 * 8π ∫ [ cos x / sin³ x ] dx\n\nThe integral of cos x / sin³ x dx is ∫ cot x / sin² x dx = ∫ cot x csc² x dx. Let u = cot x, then du/dx = -csc² x. So, integral becomes -∫ u du = - (u²)/2 + C. Wait, let's compute:\n\nLet u = sin x, then du = cos x dx. So, integral becomes ∫ du / u³ = -1/(2u²) + C = -1/(2 sin² x) + C.\n\nThus, the integral from x=2.5° to x=90° is:\n\n[ -1/(2 sin² x) ] from 2.5° to 90°\n\nAt x=90°, sin x=1, so term is -1/2.\n\nAt x=2.5°, sin(2.5°)≈0.0436, so sin² x≈0.0019, so term is -1/(2*0.0019) ≈ -263.16.\n\nThus, the integral evaluates to (-1/2) - (-263.16) ≈ 262.66.\n\nSo, the integral is approximately 262.66.\n\nTherefore, σ = (0.36 *1*13 /21 )² * 1e-26 * 8π * 262.66\n\nCompute step by step:\n\nFirst, (0.36 *13 /21 )² = (4.68 /21 )² = (0.22286)^2 ≈ 0.04967\n\nThen, 0.04967 * 1e-26 = 4.967e-28\n\nMultiply by 8π ≈ 25.133: 4.967e-28 *25.133 ≈ 1.248e-26\n\nMultiply by 262.66: 1.248e-26 *262.66 ≈ 3.28e-24 cm²\n\nSo, the integrated cross section σ ≈ 3.28e-24 cm².\n\nBut let me check the calculation again:\n\nFirst, (0.36 *13 /21 ) = 0.36*13=4.68; 4.68/21≈0.22286\n\nSquare: ≈0.04967\n\nMultiply by 1e-26: 4.967e-28\n\nMultiply by 8π: 8*3.1416≈25.133; 4.967e-28 *25.133≈1.248e-26\n\nMultiply by integral result 262.66: 1.248e-26 *262.66≈3.28e-24 cm²\n\nSo, part (d) answer is approximately 3.28e-24 cm².\n\nPart (e): Number of protons per second scattered into angles >5°. This is similar to part (c), but using the integrated cross section instead of differential.\n\nN = N_beam * n_target * σ\n\nn_target is the same as before: 6.022e20 nuclei/cm²\n\nσ =3.28e-24 cm²\n\nThus:\n\nN =1e12 *6.022e20 *3.28e-24 =1e12 *6.022e20*3.28e-24\n\nCompute exponents: 1e12 *1e20*1e-24 =1e8\n\nMultiply coefficients:6.022*3.28≈19.75\n\nSo, N≈19.75e8 ≈1.975e9 protons/s\n\nSo, approximately 2.0e9 protons per second.\n\nPart (f): Projected rms multiple Coulomb scattering angle. The formula for the rms multiple scattering angle is given by:\n\nθ_{rms} = \\frac{13.6 MeV}{β c p} Z \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{X_0}} [1 + 0.038 \\ln(x/X_0)]\n\nBut the problem states to take the constant as 15 MeV/c. So, perhaps the formula is:\n\nθ_{rms} = \\frac{15 MeV/c}{p} \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{X_0}}\n\nWhere x is the material thickness in radiation lengths. Wait, the radiation length X_0 is given as 24 g/cm². The window has thickness 0.01 cm, density 2.7 g/cm³, so the areal density is ρx =2.7 g/cm³ *0.01 cm=0.027 g/cm². Then, x/X_0 =0.027 /24=0.001125.\n\nSo, sqrt(x/X_0)=sqrt(0.001125)=0.03354\n\nThe momentum p=200 MeV/c. So,\n\nθ_{rms}= (15 MeV/c / 200 MeV/c ) *0.03354= (15/200)*0.03354=0.075*0.03354≈0.002516 radians\n\nConvert to degrees: 0.002516 * (180/π)≈0.144 degrees. But the problem asks for the rms multiple scattering angle. However, the formula might be different. Let me recall the Highland formula for multiple scattering:\n\nθ_{rms} = \\frac{13.6 MeV}{\\beta c p} Z \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{L_0}} [1 + 0.038 \\ln(L/L_0)]\n\nBut the problem says to take the constant as 15 MeV/c. So, perhaps they use:\n\nθ_{rms} = \\frac{15 MeV/c}{p} \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{L_0}}\n\nWhere L is the radiation length passed. Here, L=ρx=0.027 g/cm², L_0=24 g/cm². So sqrt(L/L_0)=sqrt(0.001125)=0.03354\n\nThen, θ_{rms}=15 MeV/c /200 MeV/c *0.03354= (15/200)*0.03354=0.075*0.03354≈0.0025165 radians\n\nConvert to projected rms angle. The projected angle (in the plane) is θ_{rms} divided by sqrt(2), but sometimes the formula already accounts for that. However, the problem says \"projected rms multiple Coulomb scattering angle\", so perhaps the formula gives the projected angle directly. If the total RMS is θ_{rms}, then the projected RMS is θ_{rms}/sqrt(2). But the problem might use the formula as given. Given that the constant is 15 MeV/c, which is similar to the Highland formula's 13.6 MeV adjusted. Assuming the given formula:\n\nθ_{rms} = (15 MeV/c / p) * sqrt(x/X_0)\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\n15/200 * sqrt(0.001125) =0.075 *0.03354≈0.002517 radians\n\nConvert to milliradians: 2.517 milliradians. So, approximately 2.52e-3 radians.\n\nBut let me check units. The constant 15 MeV/c divided by momentum in MeV/c gives unitless (15/200)=0.075. Multiply by sqrt(dimensionless), so angle is in radians. So, 0.075*0.03354≈0.002517 radians ≈ 0.144 degrees. But the problem might expect the answer in radians or degrees. The question says \"compute the projected rms multiple Coulomb scattering angle\", so likely in radians. So, approximately 0.00252 radians, or 2.52e-3 radians.\n\nBut let me confirm the formula. The standard formula for the RMS multiple scattering angle is approximately:\n\nθ_{rms} = \\frac{13.6 \\text{ MeV}}{\\beta c p} Z \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{X_0}} \\left(1 + 0.038 \\ln \\frac{x}{X_0} \\right)\n\nBut here, the problem says to take the constant as 15 MeV/c. So, perhaps they simplified it to:\n\nθ_{rms} = \\frac{15 \\text{ MeV/c}}{p} \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{X_0}}\n\nGiven that Z=13 for Aluminum, but in the formula provided, Z is included? Wait, the problem states to take the constant as 15 MeV/c. So, maybe the formula is:\n\nθ_{rms} = \\frac{15 \\text{ MeV/c}}{p} \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{X_0}}\n\nBut then, where is Z? Maybe the 15 MeV/c already includes Z. Wait, the original Highland formula has Z. Let me check:\n\nHighland formula:\n\nθ_{rms} ≈ \\frac{13.6 \\text{ MeV}}{β c p} Z \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{X_0}} [1 + 0.038 \\ln(x/X_0)]\n\nIf the problem says to take the constant as 15 MeV/c, perhaps they absorbed Z and other factors into the constant. But in our case, Z=13. However, the problem says \"take the constant in the expression for multiple Coulomb scattering as 15 MeV/c\". So, perhaps the formula is:\n\nθ_{rms} = \\frac{15 \\text{ MeV/c}}{p} \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{X_0}}\n\nIgnoring the Z dependence and the logarithmic term. Then, using x/X_0 =0.027/24=0.001125.\n\nThus:\n\nθ_{rms}=15 /200 * sqrt(0.001125)=0.075 *0.03354≈0.002517 radians≈2.52e-3 radians.\n\nSo, the answer is approximately 2.52e-3 radians.\n\nBut let me check if x is the actual thickness in radiation lengths. The radiation length X_0 is 24 g/cm². The window's areal density is 0.027 g/cm², so x/X_0=0.027/24=0.001125. So, sqrt(0.001125)=0.03354.\n\nThus, θ_{rms}=15/200 *0.03354=0.002517 radians.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, part (f) answer is approximately 0.00252 radians.\n</think>\n\n(a) The differential cross section for Rutherford scattering is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left( \\frac{Z_1 Z_2

{"id": "atomic/1-43", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The question is about finding the frequency and wavelength of radiation emitted when a hydrogen atom transitions from n=109 to n=108. Hmm, I remember that for hydrogen-like atoms, the energy levels are given by the Rydberg formula. But wait, since these are high energy levels (n is 109 and 108), maybe the transition is in the radio wave part of the spectrum. \n\nRight, the energy levels for hydrogen are given by E_n = -R_H * hc / n², where R_H is the Rydberg constant, h is Planck's constant, and c is the speed of light. But sometimes the Rydberg formula is written in terms of wavelength. Alternatively, the transition frequency can be calculated using the difference in energy between the two levels divided by Planck's constant.\n\nLet me recall the Rydberg formula for the wavelength: 1/λ = R_H * (1/n₁² - 1/n₂²), where n₁ < n₂. Wait, but here the transition is from n=109 to n=108, so the electron is moving from a higher energy level (n=109) to a lower one (n=108), emitting a photon. So n₁ would be 108 and n₂ is 109. But in the Rydberg formula, the formula is 1/λ = R_H * (1/n_final² - 1/n_initial²). Wait, no, actually, the standard Rydberg formula for emission is 1/λ = R_H * (1/n_lower² - 1/n_higher²). So since the electron is moving from 109 (higher) to 108 (lower), the formula would be 1/λ = R_H * (1/108² - 1/109²). \n\nBut wait, the Rydberg constant R_H is approximately 1.097e4 m⁻¹. Let me check that. Yes, Rydberg constant is about 1.097373e4 m⁻¹. So plugging in n_lower = 108 and n_higher = 109. Let me compute 1/108² - 1/109². Let's compute that difference. \n\nFirst, 1/108² = 1/(11664) ≈ 8.5734e-5, and 1/109² = 1/(11881) ≈ 8.4163e-5. The difference is approximately (8.5734 - 8.4163)e-5 = 0.1571e-5 = 1.571e-6. Then 1/λ = R_H * 1.571e-6. So 1.097373e4 m⁻¹ * 1.571e-6 ≈ 1.097373 * 1.571e2 ≈ Let's compute 1.097373 * 1.571. Let's see, 1 * 1.571 = 1.571, 0.097373 * 1.571 ≈ 0.153. So total ≈ 1.571 + 0.153 ≈ 1.724. So 1.724e2 m⁻¹. Therefore, 1/λ ≈ 172.4 m⁻¹, so λ ≈ 1/172.4 ≈ 0.0058 meters, which is 5.8 millimeters. Wait, that seems too short for radio waves. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, 1.097373e4 m⁻¹ multiplied by 1.571e-6. Let's compute that. 1.097373e4 is 10973.73 m⁻¹. Multiply by 1.571e-6: 10973.73 * 1.571e-6 = 10973.73 * 1.571 / 1e6. Let's compute 10973.73 * 1.571. Let's approximate:\n\n10973.73 * 1.5 = 16460.6, 10973.73 * 0.071 ≈ 779. So total ≈ 16460.6 + 779 ≈ 17239.6. Then divide by 1e6: 17239.6 / 1e6 ≈ 0.0172396 m⁻¹. Therefore, 1/λ ≈ 0.01724 m⁻¹, so λ ≈ 1 / 0.01724 ≈ 57.97 meters. Wait, that's a big difference. So my initial calculation was wrong because I messed up the exponents. Let me redo that step.\n\nSo R_H is 1.097373e4 m⁻¹. The difference (1/108² - 1/109²) is approximately 1.571e-6. Then 1/λ = R_H * (1.571e-6) = 1.097373e4 * 1.571e-6. Let's compute that:\n\n1.097373e4 = 10973.73\n\nMultiply by 1.571e-6: 10973.73 * 1.571 = ?\n\nLet me compute 10,000 * 1.571 = 15,710\n\n973.73 * 1.571 ≈ Let's compute 900 * 1.571 = 1,413.9, 73.73 * 1.571 ≈ 115.8. So total ≈ 1,413.9 + 115.8 ≈ 1,529.7\n\nSo total is 15,710 + 1,529.7 ≈ 17,239.7\n\nThen multiply by 1e-6: 17,239.7e-6 = 0.0172397 m⁻¹\n\nTherefore, λ = 1 / 0.0172397 ≈ 57.97 meters. So wavelength is approximately 58 meters. That's in the radio wave range, which makes sense for hydrogen transitions in astronomy. \n\nNow, frequency is c / λ. The speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. So frequency ν = 3e8 / 57.97 ≈ 5.17e6 Hz, which is about 5.17 MHz. Wait, 3e8 divided by 58 is approximately 5.172e6 Hz, which is 5.17 MHz. That's in the HF (high frequency) radio band. \n\nBut wait, let me check the exact calculation. Let's compute 3e8 / 57.97:\n\n3e8 / 57.97 ≈ 3,000,000,000 / 57.97 ≈ Let's divide 3e8 by 58:\n\n3e8 / 58 ≈ 5,172,413.79 Hz ≈ 5.17 MHz. So approximately 5.17 MHz frequency and 58 meters wavelength. \n\nBut wait, I think there's a more precise formula for transitions between high n levels. Because when n is very large, the energy levels are close together, and the transition frequency can be approximated using a different approach. Let me recall that for large n, the energy difference between adjacent levels can be approximated. \n\nThe energy of a hydrogen atom is E_n = -R_H * hc / n². So the difference between n and n-1 is ΔE = E_{n-1} - E_n = R_H hc (1/n² - 1/(n-1)^2). Wait, but since we're going from n=109 to 108, the energy difference is E_108 - E_109 = R_H hc (1/109² - 1/108²). Wait, but since the energy is negative, moving to a lower n (more negative) would mean the energy difference is negative, so the emitted photon has energy equal to the absolute value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the approximation for large n. Let's consider n as a large number, so the difference between n and n-1 is small. Then, we can approximate the energy difference using a derivative. The energy E_n = -R_H hc / n². Then, dE/dn = 2 R_H hc / n³. So the energy difference between n and n-1 is approximately dE ≈ 2 R_H hc / n³. Therefore, the frequency ν ≈ (2 R_H c) / n³. \n\nLet me check this approximation. For n=109, ν ≈ 2 * Rydberg constant * c / n³. Rydberg constant R_H is 1.097e4 m⁻¹. So 2 * 1.097e4 m⁻¹ * 3e8 m/s / (109)^3. Let's compute that:\n\nFirst, compute 2 * 1.097e4 * 3e8 = 2 * 1.097e4 * 3e8 = 6.582e12. Then divide by 109³. 109³ is (100+9)^3 = 100^3 + 3*100^2*9 + 3*100*9^2 + 9^3 = 1e6 + 270,000 + 24,300 + 729 = 1,294,300 + 24,300 = 1,318,600 + 729 = 1,319,329. So 109³ ≈ 1,295,029 (Wait, actually, 109*109=11881, then 11881*109: 11881*100=1,188,100; 11881*9=106,929; total 1,295,029). So 109³ = 1,295,029. \n\nSo 6.582e12 / 1.295e6 ≈ 6.582 / 1.295 ≈ 5.08e6 Hz. Which is about 5.08 MHz. That's very close to the previous calculation of 5.17 MHz. So the approximation holds. Therefore, the frequency is approximately 5.1 MHz, wavelength about 58 meters. \n\nSo part (a) answer: frequency ≈ 5.17 MHz, wavelength ≈ 58 meters. \n\nNow part (b): the same transition observed in excited helium atoms. We need the ratio of the wavelengths of He to H. \n\nWait, helium is a hydrogen-like ion, but in this case, if it's excited helium, maybe it's He+? Because neutral helium has two electrons, but if it's singly ionized, He+, then it's a hydrogen-like ion with Z=2. \n\nAssuming that the transition is in He+, which has a nuclear charge Z=2. The energy levels for hydrogen-like atoms are given by E_n = -Z² * R_H * hc / n². So the energy difference would be ΔE = Z² R_H hc (1/n_lower² - 1/n_higher²). \n\nThe wavelength λ is inversely proportional to ΔE, since λ = hc / ΔE. So for hydrogen, ΔE_H = R_H hc (1/108² - 1/109²). For helium, ΔE_He = Z² R_H hc (1/108² - 1/109²). Therefore, ΔE_He = Z² ΔE_H. Since Z=2 for He+, ΔE_He = 4 ΔE_H. \n\nSince λ is inversely proportional to ΔE, the wavelength for He would be λ_He = λ_H / 4. Therefore, the ratio λ_He / λ_H = 1/4. \n\nWait, but wait, the transition in He+ would have the same n values? The problem states \"the same transition has also been observed in excited helium atoms.\" So same n=109 to n=108, but for He+. Therefore, the energy levels are scaled by Z². Therefore, the energy difference is 4 times larger, leading to a photon with 4 times the energy, hence 1/4 the wavelength. Therefore, the ratio λ_He / λ_H = 1/4. \n\nSo the ratio is 1:4, so the answer is 1/4. \n\nBut let me confirm. For hydrogen-like atoms, the transition wavelength scales as 1/Z². Because the energy difference is proportional to Z², so the wavelength is inversely proportional to Z². Therefore, λ_He = λ_H / Z² = λ_H /4. Therefore, the ratio is 1/4. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So part (b) answer is 1/4. \n\nPart (c): Why is it difficult to observe this transition in a laboratory experiment? \n\nWell, the wavelength is about 58 meters, which is a very long wavelength. In the lab, generating and detecting such long wavelengths is challenging. Also, the corresponding frequency is around 5 MHz, which is in the radio range, but perhaps the main issue is that transitions between such high n states (n=109) require the atoms to be in highly excited states, which are easily disturbed in laboratory conditions. \n\nIn space, hydrogen atoms can be in these high Rydberg states because the environment is a vacuum and low density, so the atoms don't collide frequently. In a lab, maintaining such high n states is difficult because collisions with other atoms or electrons would cause ionization or de-excitation. Additionally, the transition has a low frequency, which might require large apparatus to detect, or the photons have low energy, making them harder to detect against thermal noise. \n\nSo the main reasons are: 1) difficulty in maintaining high n Rydberg states in the lab due to collisions and perturbations, 2) long wavelength radiation is technically challenging to detect in a laboratory setting, and 3) low photon energy may be masked by thermal noise.\n</think>\n\n(a) The frequency and wavelength of the radiation emitted in the transition from \\( n = 109 \\) to \\( n = 108 \\) in hydrogen can be calculated using the Rydberg formula.

{"id": "atomic/1-44", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to sketch the energy levels of atomic lithium (Li) for n=2, 3, 4 and also include hydrogen's energy levels for the same n values. Then indicate some emission and absorption lines, and show how they compare. Hmm, let's start by recalling the energy levels for hydrogen and lithium.\n\nFirst, hydrogen's energy levels are given by the Bohr formula: E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for n=2, 3, 4, the energies are -3.4 eV, -1.511 eV, and -0.85 eV respectively. These are straightforward.\n\nBut lithium is a multi-electron atom, so the energy levels are different. In lithium, the electrons are in different orbitals, and there's shielding. The valence electron in lithium is in the n=2 orbital because lithium has electrons in 1s²2s¹. Wait, but when excited, the outer electron can go to higher n. So for atomic lithium, the energy levels depend on both the principal quantum number n and the azimuthal (or orbital angular momentum) quantum number l. Because of the screening effect, the energy levels for the same n but different l will split. For example, for a given n, the s electrons (l=0) are lower in energy than p (l=1), which are lower than d (l=2), etc. But in hydrogen, all l states for a given n are degenerate (same energy), but in multi-electron atoms, they split.\n\nSo for lithium, the energy levels for the valence electron would be calculated using the Rydberg formula adjusted for the effective nuclear charge. The formula is E_n = - (Z_eff² * 13.6 eV) / n², where Z_eff is the effective nuclear charge. For lithium's valence electron (n=2), Z_eff is approximately 1.3. Wait, but when the electron is in higher n levels, like n=3 or 4, the Z_eff might be different. But maybe for simplicity, we can approximate it as Z_eff ≈ 1.3 for all n? Or does Z_eff depend on both n and l?\n\nActually, the effective nuclear charge depends on the orbital. For example, in lithium, the 2s electron experiences a higher Z_eff than the 2p because s electrons penetrate closer to the nucleus and are less shielded. So for the same n, lower l means lower energy (more negative). So for lithium, the energy levels for the same n but different l are split. For example, 2s is lower than 2p. Similarly, 3s < 3p < 3d, etc. But in hydrogen, all these l states for the same n are the same.\n\nSo when sketching the energy levels, for each n (2,3,4), lithium will have different energy levels for different l values, while hydrogen's are all the same for each n. But how exactly do their energies compare? Let's think. For hydrogen, n=2 is -3.4 eV. For lithium's 2s electron, the energy is lower (more negative) because Z_eff is higher. For example, if Z_eff is about 1.3 for 2s, then E_2s (Li) = - (1.3² *13.6)/2² = -(1.69 *13.6)/4 ≈ - (22.984)/4 ≈ -5.746 eV. But wait, that's more negative than hydrogen's n=1 level (-13.6 eV). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the principal quantum number here. Lithium's valence electron is in n=2, but the inner electrons are in n=1. So when the valence electron is excited to higher n, like n=3 or 4, the effective nuclear charge it experiences would be less than the full nuclear charge (Z=3 for Li), but more than 1. Let me check actual data.\n\nWait, perhaps using the Rydberg formula for alkali metals like lithium is more complex. The energy levels for alkali metals can be approximated by the Rydberg formula with a quantum defect: E_nl = -13.6 eV / (n - δ_l)², where δ_l is the quantum defect depending on l. For example, for lithium:\n\n- For s orbitals (l=0), δ ≈ 0.41\n- For p orbitals (l=1), δ ≈ 0.04\n- For d orbitals (l=2), δ ≈ 0.001 (almost hydrogenic)\n\nSo for lithium's 2s (n=2, l=0), the effective principal quantum number is n* = n - δ = 2 - 0.41 = 1.59. Then E_2s = -13.6 / (1.59)² ≈ -13.6 / 2.528 ≈ -5.38 eV.\n\nSimilarly, for 2p (n=2, l=1), δ=0.04, so n* = 2 - 0.04 = 1.96. Then E_2p = -13.6 / (1.96)² ≈ -13.6 / 3.8416 ≈ -3.54 eV. Wait, but 2p in Li would have higher energy (less negative) than 2s. So for n=2, the 2s is lower energy than 2p. But in hydrogen, n=2 is all the same. So hydrogen's n=2 is at -3.4 eV. Li's 2p is at -3.54 eV, which is slightly lower than hydrogen's n=2. Hmm, but that's close. Wait, maybe the actual values are different. Let me check approximate energy levels for lithium.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to recall that in alkali metals, the valence electron's energy levels are lower (more negative) than hydrogen's for the same n. But due to the quantum defect, the energy levels are split. For example, for lithium:\n\n- 2s: E ≈ -5.39 eV\n- 2p: E ≈ -3.54 eV\n- 3s: E ≈ -2.01 eV\n- 3p: E ≈ -1.55 eV\n- 3d: E ≈ -1.51 eV (close to hydrogen's n=3)\n- 4s: E ≈ -1.05 eV\n- 4p: E ≈ -0.87 eV\n- 4d: E ≈ -0.85 eV\n- 4f: E ≈ -0.85 eV (almost hydrogenic)\n\nHydrogen's n=2 is -3.4 eV, n=3 is -1.51 eV, n=4 is -0.85 eV.\n\nSo comparing Li's energy levels to hydrogen's:\n\n- Li 2s (-5.39 eV) is much lower than H n=1 (-13.6), but since we're only considering n=2,3,4 for Li, maybe we should focus on the valence electron's excited states. Wait, but the problem says \"atomic Li for the states with n=2,3,4\". Wait, but in Li, the ground state is 2s, so n=2 is the lowest. Then excited states would be 3s, 3p, 4s, 4p, etc. But the problem says to sketch the energy levels for n=2,3,4. So perhaps for each n=2,3,4, Li has different l values (s, p, d, etc.), each at different energies.\n\nSo for Li:\n\nn=2: 2s (l=0) and 2p (l=1). But wait, in the ground state, Li has 1s²2s¹. So when excited, the 2s electron can jump to higher orbitals. So the energy levels for Li would be:\n\nn=2: 2s (lower energy), 2p (higher energy than 2s but lower than hydrogen's n=2?)\n\nWait, according to the values I mentioned earlier, Li's 2p is at -3.54 eV, which is slightly lower (more negative) than hydrogen's n=2 (-3.4 eV). So hydrogen's n=2 is higher in energy (less negative) than Li's 2p. So the order from lowest to highest energy (most negative to least):\n\nLi 2s (-5.39) < Li 2p (-3.54) < H n=2 (-3.4) < Li 3s (-2.01) < Li 3p (-1.55) < H n=3 (-1.51) < Li 3d (-1.51) < Li 4s (-1.05) < Li 4p (-0.87) < H n=4 (-0.85) < Li 4d (-0.85) < Li 4f (-0.85).\n\nWait, but H's n=3 is -1.51 eV, which is the same as Li's 3d. So maybe Li's 3d is very close to H's n=3. Similarly, Li's 4f would be almost the same as H's n=4.\n\nSo when sketching the energy levels, for each n, Li has multiple levels (s, p, d, etc.) with s being the lowest, then p, then d, etc., each higher in energy (less negative) than the previous. Hydrogen's levels are single for each n, and they lie between Li's levels. For example, H's n=2 is between Li's 2p and 3s. H's n=3 is between Li's 3p and 3d. H's n=4 is between Li's 4p and 4d (or 4f).\n\nSo the energy diagram would have for Li:\n\n- n=2: 2s (lowest), 2p (higher than 2s)\n- n=3: 3s (lower than H n=3), 3p (higher than 3s), 3d (close to H n=3)\n- n=4: 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f (with 4f almost same as H n=4)\n\nHydrogen's levels are single lines at n=2 (-3.4), n=3 (-1.51), n=4 (-0.85).\n\nNow, emission lines occur when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one. Absorption is the opposite. For Li, possible emission lines could be from 3p → 2s, 3s → 2p, 4s → 2p, etc. Absorption lines would be from lower to higher, like 2s → 3p, 2p → 4s, etc.\n\nHydrogen's emission lines would be transitions between its own levels, like 3→2 (Balmer series), 4→2, etc. But the problem says to indicate several lines for Li in emission and absorption, and show H's levels on the same diagram.\n\nSo the sketch should have energy levels with Li's split into different l for each n, and H's as single lines. Then arrows for transitions: emission (downward) and absorption (upward).\n\nBut how to represent this? Let me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Draw vertical lines for energy levels. For each n (2,3,4), Li has multiple levels (s, p, d), and H has one level per n.\n\n2. Arrange the energies from bottom (most negative) to top (least negative):\n\nLi 2s (-5.39)\n\nLi 2p (-3.54)\n\nH n=2 (-3.4)\n\nLi 3s (-2.01)\n\nLi 3p (-1.55)\n\nH n=3 (-1.51)\n\nLi 3d (-1.51)\n\nLi 4s (-1.05)\n\nLi 4p (-0.87)\n\nH n=4 (-0.85)\n\nLi 4d (-0.85)\n\nLi 4f (-0.85)\n\nSo the order from bottom up:\n\nLi2s, Li2p, H2, Li3s, Li3p, H3, Li3d, Li4s, Li4p, H4, Li4d, Li4f.\n\n3. Now, emission lines for Li could be:\n\n- From Li3p to Li2s (ΔE = -1.55 - (-5.39) = 3.84 eV)\n\n- From Li3d to Li2p (ΔE = -1.51 - (-3.54) = 2.03 eV)\n\n- From Li4p to Li3s (ΔE = -0.87 - (-2.01) = 1.14 eV)\n\nAbsorption lines would be transitions from lower to higher, like:\n\n- Li2s to Li3p (same as above but absorption)\n\n- Li2p to Li4s (ΔE = -0.87 - (-3.54) = 2.67 eV)\n\nHydrogen's lines would be transitions like H3→H2 (Balmer alpha), H4→H2 (Balmer beta), etc.\n\nBut the problem says to indicate several emission and absorption lines for Li, and show H's levels. So on the diagram, arrows for emission (down) and absorption (up) between Li's levels, and H's levels as separate lines.\n\nSo the final answer would involve a diagram where:\n\n- Li's energy levels are split into s, p, d for each n, with s lowest, then p, then d.\n\n- Hydrogen's levels are single lines at higher energies (less negative) compared to Li's same n but lower l.\n\nFor example, H n=2 is higher than Li 2p, H n=3 is higher than Li 3p but same as Li3d, and H n=4 is same as Li4d and 4f.\n\nEmission lines for Li could be 3p→2s, 3d→2p, 4p→3s.\n\nAbsorption lines could be 2s→3p, 2p→4s, etc.\n\nHydrogen's transitions would be between its own levels.\n\nBut since the question asks to sketch the energy levels and indicate several emission and absorption lines, the key points are:\n\n1. Draw Li's levels with splitting for each n (s, p, d) and H's levels as single lines.\n\n2. Show arrows for Li's transitions: emission (down) and absorption (up).\n\n3. Position H's levels between Li's split levels for the same n.\n\nThe actual sketch can't be drawn here, but the description would include these elements. The final answer should mention that the energy levels of Li are split into different l states for each n, with lower l being lower in energy, and H's levels are single and lie between Li's split levels. Emission lines for Li are transitions from higher to lower energy states (e.g., 3p→2s), and absorption lines are the reverse.

{"id": "atomic/3-8", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question about particles and their antiparticles. The question has three parts: a, b, and c. I need to figure out which statements are correct. Let me start by recalling what I know about antiparticles.\n\nFirst, for part (a): \"must have the same mass.\" From what I remember, a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass but opposite charges. For example, the electron and positron have the same mass, but the positron has a positive charge while the electron is negative. So, if that's the case, then statement (a) should be true. But wait, are there any exceptions? Maybe neutral particles? Like the neutron and antineutron? The neutron has a magnetic moment, and the antineutron would have the opposite, but their masses are the same. So yes, even neutral particles and their antiparticles have the same mass. So (a) is correct.\n\nMoving to part (b): \"must be different from each other.\" Hmm. Some particles are their own antiparticles. For example, the photon is its own antiparticle. Similarly, the neutral pion is its own antiparticle. So in those cases, the particle and antiparticle are the same. Therefore, statement (b) says they must be different, which would be false for those examples. So (b) is not necessarily true. So (b) is incorrect.\n\nNow part (c): \"can always annihilate into two photons.\" Wait, annihilation typically occurs when a particle meets its antiparticle. For electrons and positrons, they can annihilate into two photons. But does this apply to all particles? Let's think. Take a proton and antiproton. When they annihilate, they produce other particles like pions, not necessarily photons. Also, for neutral particles like the neutron and antineutron, their annihilation would produce other particles as well. Photons are bosons, so maybe the annihilation into two photons depends on the charges. For charged particles, like electron-positron, annihilation into two photons is possible. But for neutral particles, maybe not. Wait, but the photon is a boson and neutral. For example, a muon and antimuon can annihilate into photon pairs, but maybe there's a conservation law here. Wait, photons have spin 1. When a particle and antiparticle annihilate, they must conserve things like charge, which they do (since total charge is zero), but also other quantum numbers. Also, angular momentum. For two photons, their spins can add up to 0 or 2. But when an electron and positron annihilate, they can produce two photons because their spins can combine appropriately. However, for some particles, maybe the annihilation into two photons isn't allowed. For example, a proton and antiproton are fermions, but their annihilation products depend on the available energy and conservation laws. However, the question says \"can always annihilate into two photons.\" So the key word is \"always.\" If there's any case where they can't, then (c) is false. For example, a neutrino and antineutrino. Neutrinos are neutral and have very weak interactions. Annihilating into two photons would require electromagnetic interaction, but neutrinos don't have electric charge. So they can't annihilate into photons. Therefore, statement (c) is incorrect because not all particle-antiparticle pairs can annihilate into two photons. So (c) is false.\n\nPutting it all together: (a) is correct, (b) and (c) are incorrect. So the answer should be only (a) is correct.\n</think>\n\n(a) A particle and its antiparticle must have the same mass. This is a fundamental property of antiparticles, as they share identical mass but opposite quantum numbers (e.g., charge). Even neutral particles like the neutron and antineutron have the same mass.  \n**True.**\n\n(b) The statement that a particle and its antiparticle \"must be different from each other\" is false. Some particles, like the photon and the neutral pion, are their own antiparticles. Thus, they are not distinct.  \n**False.**\n\n(c) Annihilation into two photons is not always possible. While charged particles like electrons and positrons can annihilate into photons, neutral particles (e.g., neutrinos and antineutrinos) cannot due to the lack of electromagnetic interaction. Additionally, annihilation products depend on conservation laws and interaction types.  \n**False.**\n\nFinal answer:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{(a)}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["(a)"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "(a)", "expr2": "a"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "a", "expr2": "a"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/3-39", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to estimate the decay rate of the Sigma-minus particle decaying into Lambda, an electron, and an anti-neutrino. The problem states that the same weak interaction is responsible for both this decay and the neutron beta decay, and the matrix elements are the same. The lifetime of a free neutron is given as about 10^3 seconds, and I have the masses of all the particles involved. \n\nFirst, I remember that the decay rate (Γ) for a weak interaction process like beta decay is proportional to the fifth power of the maximum energy of the emitted electron (or the Q-value of the reaction), according to Fermi's Golden Rule. This is often referred to as the phase space factor. The formula is something like Γ ≈ G² * (Q)^5 / (some constants), where G is the coupling constant. But since the matrix elements are the same for both decays, the ratio of the decay rates should depend on the ratio of their phase space factors, which in turn depend on the Q-values raised to the fifth power.\n\nSo, the key here is to calculate the Q-values for both the neutron decay and the Sigma-minus decay. The Q-value is the total energy released in the decay, which is the difference in rest mass between the initial particle and the final particles. For neutron decay: n → p + e⁻ + ν̄. The Q-value would be m_n - m_p - m_e - m_ν. But since the neutrino mass is negligible (given as 0), it's just m_n - m_p - m_e. Similarly, for the Sigma-minus decay: Σ⁻ → Λ + e⁻ + ν̄. The Q-value here is m_Σ - m_Λ - m_e - m_ν, which again, m_ν is 0, so it's m_Σ - m_Λ - m_e.\n\nLet me compute these Q-values numerically. \n\nFor the neutron decay:\nm_n = 939.57 MeV/c²\nm_p = 938.28 MeV/c²\nm_e = 0.51 MeV/c²\nSo Q_n = 939.57 - 938.28 - 0.51 = 939.57 - 938.79 = 0.78 MeV.\n\nFor the Sigma-minus decay:\nm_Σ = 1197.35 MeV/c²\nm_Λ = 1116.058 MeV/c²\nm_e = 0.51 MeV/c²\nSo Q_Σ = 1197.35 - 1116.058 - 0.51 = 1197.35 - 1116.568 = 80.782 MeV.\n\nWait, that seems like a much larger Q-value for the Sigma decay. That makes sense because the Sigma is a much heavier particle, so the mass difference between Sigma and Lambda is significant. \n\nNow, the decay rate Γ is proportional to Q^5. Since the matrix elements are the same, the ratio of the decay rates Γ_Σ / Γ_n = (Q_Σ / Q_n)^5. \n\nBut wait, there's also a dependence on the available phase space. The phase space integral for beta decay is often approximated as proportional to Q^5, but maybe there are some other factors. However, the problem states that the matrix elements are the same, so the main difference comes from the phase space factors. Therefore, the ratio of the decay rates should be (Q_Σ / Q_n)^5. \n\nGiven that the neutron's lifetime τ_n is 10^3 seconds, and since the decay rate Γ is the inverse of the lifetime (Γ = 1/τ), then Γ_Σ = Γ_n * (Q_Σ / Q_n)^5. \n\nSo let's compute that ratio. \n\nFirst, Q_n is 0.78 MeV, Q_Σ is approximately 80.782 MeV. Let me check the exact numbers again. \n\nCalculating Q_Σ again: 1197.35 - 1116.058 = 81.292, then subtract 0.51 gives 80.782 MeV. Correct. \n\nSo the ratio Q_Σ / Q_n is 80.782 / 0.78 ≈ 103.56. \n\nThen, (103.56)^5. Let me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, 100^5 is 10^10. But 103.56 is a bit more. Let's approximate:\n\n103.56^5 = (100 + 3.56)^5. Using binomial expansion might be tedious, but maybe using logarithms. \n\nAlternatively, compute 103.56^5:\n\nFirst, 103.56^2 ≈ (103.56)*(103.56). Let's compute 100*103.56 = 10,356, 3.56*103.56 ≈ 3.56*100 + 3.56*3.56 ≈ 356 + ~12.67 ≈ 368.67. So total is 10,356 + 368.67 ≈ 10,724.67. \n\nThen, 103.56^3 ≈ 10,724.67 * 103.56. Let's approximate 10,724.67 * 100 = 1,072,467, and 10,724.67 * 3.56 ≈ 10,724.67 * 3 = 32,174.01 + 10,724.67 * 0.56 ≈ ~6,005.81. So total ≈ 1,072,467 + 32,174.01 + 6,005.81 ≈ 1,110,646.82. \n\nThen, 103.56^4 ≈ 1,110,646.82 * 103.56. Again, 1,110,646.82 * 100 = 111,064,682, and 1,110,646.82 * 3.56 ≈ 3,954, 000 (approx). So total ≈ 111,064,682 + 3,954,000 ≈ 115,018,682. \n\nThen, 103.56^5 ≈ 115,018,682 * 103.56. Let's do 115,018,682 * 100 = 11,501,868,200 and 115,018,682 * 3.56 ≈ 409, 466, 500 (approx). So total ≈ 11,501,868,200 + 409,466,500 ≈ 11,911,334,700. \n\nBut this is a very rough approximation. Alternatively, using natural logarithms:\n\nln(103.56) ≈ ln(100) + ln(1.0356) ≈ 4.605 + 0.0349 ≈ 4.6399\n\nMultiply by 5: 5 * 4.6399 ≈ 23.1995\n\nExponentiate: e^23.1995 ≈ e^23 * e^0.1995 ≈ e^23 is about 9.74*10^9 (since e^10 ≈ 22026, e^20 ≈ 4.85*10^8, e^23 ≈ e^20 * e^3 ≈ 4.85e8 * 20.085 ≈ 9.74e9). Then e^0.1995 ≈ 1.220. So total ≈ 9.74e9 * 1.22 ≈ 1.188e10. \n\nSo (103.56)^5 ≈ 1.188e10. \n\nBut wait, my previous step-by-step multiplication gave around 1.19e10, which is similar. So the ratio (Q_Σ/Q_n)^5 is approximately 1.19e10. \n\nTherefore, Γ_Σ = Γ_n * (Q_Σ/Q_n)^5. Since Γ_n is 1 / τ_n = 1 / 10^3 s⁻¹. \n\nSo Γ_Σ ≈ (1 / 10^3) * 1.19e10 ≈ 1.19e7 s⁻¹. \n\nTherefore, the decay rate of Sigma-minus is approximately 1.19e7 s⁻¹, so the lifetime τ_Σ = 1 / Γ_Σ ≈ 8.4e-8 seconds. \n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the decay rate, not the lifetime. So the answer would be Γ_Σ ≈ 1.19e7 s⁻¹. But let me check the exact numbers again. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Q-values. Let me recalculate them precisely. \n\nFor neutron decay Q_n:\n\nm_n = 939.57 MeV\n\nm_p = 938.28 MeV\n\nm_e = 0.51 MeV\n\nSo Q_n = 939.57 - 938.28 - 0.51 = (939.57 - 938.28) = 1.29 MeV, then subtract 0.51 gives 0.78 MeV. Correct. \n\nFor Sigma decay Q_Σ:\n\nm_Σ = 1197.35 MeV\n\nm_Λ = 1116.058 MeV\n\nm_e = 0.51 MeV\n\nQ_Σ = 1197.35 - 1116.058 - 0.51 = (1197.35 - 1116.058) = 81.292 MeV, then subtract 0.51 gives 80.782 MeV. Correct. \n\nSo the ratio Q_Σ/Q_n is 80.782 / 0.78 ≈ 103.56. \n\nThen, (103.56)^5. Let me compute this more accurately. \n\nUsing a calculator: 103.56^5. \n\nFirst, 103.56^2 = 103.56 * 103.56. Let's compute 100*103.56 = 10356, 3.56*103.56 = 3.56*100 + 3.56*3.56 = 356 + 12.6736 = 368.6736. So total is 10356 + 368.6736 = 10724.6736.\n\nThen, 103.56^3 = 10724.6736 * 103.56. Let's compute 10724.6736 * 100 = 1,072,467.36, and 10724.6736 * 3.56. \n\nCompute 10724.6736 * 3 = 32,174.0208, and 10724.6736 * 0.56 = 6,005.817216. Summing these gives 32,174.0208 + 6,005.817216 = 38,179.838016. So total is 1,072,467.36 + 38,179.838016 = 1,110,647.198016.\n\nNext, 103.56^4 = 1,110,647.198016 * 103.56. \n\nCompute 1,110,647.198016 * 100 = 111,064,719.8016, and 1,110,647.198016 * 3.56. \n\nCalculate 1,110,647.198016 * 3 = 3,331,941.594048, and 1,110,647.198016 * 0.56 = 622, 362.430889. Summing gives 3,331,941.594048 + 622,362.430889 ≈ 3,954,304.024937. \n\nTotal for 103.56^4 is 111,064,719.8016 + 3,954,304.024937 ≈ 115,019,023.8265.\n\nNow, 103.56^5 = 115,019,023.8265 * 103.56. \n\nCompute 115,019,023.8265 * 100 = 11,501,902,382.65, and 115,019,023.8265 * 3.56. \n\nCalculate 115,019,023.8265 * 3 = 345,057,071.4795, and 115,019,023.8265 * 0.56 ≈ 64,410,653.343. Summing gives 345,057,071.4795 + 64,410,653.343 ≈ 409,467,724.8225. \n\nTotal 103.56^5 ≈ 11,501,902,382.65 + 409,467,724.8225 ≈ 11,911,370,107.47. \n\nSo approximately 1.1911e10. \n\nTherefore, the ratio (Q_Σ/Q_n)^5 ≈ 1.1911e10. \n\nThen, Γ_Σ = Γ_n * (Q_Σ/Q_n)^5. \n\nΓ_n is 1 / (10^3 s) = 1e-3 s⁻¹. \n\nSo Γ_Σ ≈ 1e-3 * 1.1911e10 = 1.1911e7 s⁻¹. \n\nSo approximately 1.19e7 s⁻¹. \n\nBut wait, is there any other factor I might be missing? For example, in beta decay, the phase space integral also includes some terms like the Fermi function or radiative corrections, but the problem states that the matrix elements are the same, so those factors are already accounted for. Therefore, the main difference is indeed the Q^5 factor. \n\nTherefore, the decay rate of the Sigma-minus is approximately 1.19e7 s⁻¹. \n\nBut let me check if the approximation holds. The neutron decay rate is 1e-3 s⁻¹, and the Sigma decay rate is about 1.19e7 times larger, so 1.19e7 * 1e-3 = 1.19e4 s⁻¹? Wait, no. Wait, Γ_Σ = Γ_n * (Q_Σ/Q_n)^5. Γ_n is 1e-3 s⁻¹. So 1e-3 * 1.19e10 = 1.19e7 s⁻¹. Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo the decay rate is approximately 1.19e7 per second. \n\nBut wait, the actual calculation for beta decay rates involves more than just Q^5. The full formula for the decay rate includes an integral over the phase space, which for allowed transitions (which these are, since they're both beta decays) is proportional to the integral from m_e c² to Q of (E_e^2 - m_e^2 c^4)^(1/2) (Q - E_e)^2 E_e dE_e. This integral is often approximated as proportional to Q^5 when Q >> m_e c², but in the neutron decay, Q is about 0.78 MeV, which is just over the electron mass (0.51 MeV), so the approximation might not be perfect. However, for the Sigma decay, Q is about 80 MeV, which is much larger than m_e, so the Q^5 approximation is better. \n\nBut since the problem states that the matrix elements are the same and to assume the same basic interaction, we can proceed with the Q^5 scaling. \n\nTherefore, the estimated decay rate Γ_Σ is approximately 1.2e7 s⁻¹. \n\nBut to be precise, let's use the exact Q values. \n\nQ_n = 0.78 MeV\n\nQ_Σ = 80.782 MeV\n\nRatio = 80.782 / 0.78 ≈ 103.5666...\n\nSo (103.5666...)^5 = ?\n\nUsing a calculator for better precision: 103.5666^5. \n\nBut since I don't have a calculator here, but given that my previous step-by-step multiplication gave approximately 1.19e10, and the exact value might be around 1.19e10. \n\nTherefore, Γ_Σ ≈ 1e-3 s⁻¹ * 1.19e10 = 1.19e7 s⁻¹. \n\nSo the decay rate is approximately 1.19 × 10^7 s⁻¹. \n\nBut wait, the neutron's decay rate is 1e-3 s⁻¹, so multiplying by 1.19e10 gives 1.19e7 s⁻¹. \n\nTherefore, the answer is Γ_Σ ≈ 1.2 × 10^7 s⁻¹. \n\nBut let me check the exponent again. 1e-3 * 1e10 = 1e7. Yes. \n\nSo the final answer is approximately 1.2 × 10^7 s⁻¹. \n\nBut to be more precise with the numbers, since 80.782 / 0.78 = 103.5666..., so (103.5666...)^5. Let's compute this using logarithms. \n\nln(103.5666) = ln(100) + ln(1.035666) ≈ 4.60517 + 0.035 ≈ 4.64017\n\nMultiply by 5: 5 * 4.64017 ≈ 23.20085\n\ne^23.20085 ≈ e^23 * e^0.20085 ≈ e^23 ≈ 9.7448e9 (since e^23 ≈ e^(20+3) = e^20 * e^3 ≈ 4.85165e8 * 20.0855 ≈ 9.7448e9). Then e^0.20085 ≈ 1.222. \n\nSo total ≈ 9.7448e9 * 1.222 ≈ 1.191e10. \n\nTherefore, the ratio is 1.191e10. \n\nThus, Γ_Σ = 1e-3 * 1.191e10 = 1.191e7 s⁻¹. \n\nSo approximately 1.19 × 10^7 s⁻¹. \n\nTherefore, the decay rate of Σ⁻ → Λ e⁻ ν̄ is about 1.2 × 10^7 per second. \n\nBut wait, the actual answer might need to be expressed with one significant figure, given the approximation in the neutron lifetime (10^3 seconds). But the problem says \"estimate\", so maybe two significant figures. \n\nBut the given neutron lifetime is 1e3 seconds, which is one significant figure. However, the masses are given to more decimal places, so perhaps we can use more precise figures. \n\nBut since the problem says \"estimate\", and given that the ratio is approximate, the answer is likely around 1.2 × 10^7 s⁻¹. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the exact calculation gives a slightly different value, but given the method, this is the result. \n\nSo the final answer is Γ_Σ ≈ 1.2 × 10^7 s⁻¹. \n\nBut let me check once more. \n\nQ_Σ = 1197.35 - 1116.058 - 0.51 = 1197.35 - 1116.568 = 80.782 MeV. \n\nQ_n = 0.78 MeV. \n\nRatio = 80.782 / 0.78 = 103.5666... \n\n(103.5666)^5 = ?\n\nUsing a calculator (if I had one), but since I don't, the previous estimate of 1.19e10 is acceptable. \n\nThus, Γ_Σ = 1e-3 * 1.19e10 = 1.19e7 s⁻¹. \n\nSo the decay rate is approximately 1.19 × 10^7 s⁻¹. \n\nExpressed in boxed notation, that would be \\boxed{1.2 \\times 10^{7} \\text{ s}^{-1}}.\n</think>\n\nTo estimate the decay rate of the process \\(\\Sigma^- \\rightarrow \\Lambda e \\bar{\\nu}\\), we use the given masses and the fact that the matrix elements for both neutron beta decay and the Sigma-minus decay are the same.

{"id": "atomic/4-11", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this physics problem about two-body elastic collisions. The question has three parts (a, b, c), and I need to determine which statements are true. Hmm, I remember that in elastic collisions, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. But each part is about different aspects: trajectories in the center of mass frame, helicity, and angular distribution symmetry. Let me think through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with part (a): \"All the particle trajectories must lie in the same plane in the center of mass frame.\" In the center of mass (COM) frame, the total momentum is zero. Before the collision, the two particles are moving towards each other along a straight line, right? After the collision, since it's elastic, they must move in such a way that their momenta are opposite again. But in three dimensions, could their trajectories be in different planes? Wait, no. Because in the COM frame, the initial motion is along a line. The collision can only change the direction of their velocities, but since the collision is two-body, the interaction forces are along the line connecting them during the collision (assuming it's a central force, but even if not, angular momentum is conserved). Wait, but in reality, collisions can be non-central, leading to scattering in different directions. However, in the COM frame, the initial and final momenta must be equal and opposite. So the trajectories after collision would lie in the same plane as the initial trajectory. Because the initial motion is along a line (so in a plane), and any scattering would be in a plane. So yes, all trajectories lie in the same plane. So statement (a) is true.\n\nMoving to part (b): \"The helicity of a participant cannot change.\" Helicity is the projection of a particle's spin onto its momentum direction. In an elastic collision, if the particle's direction changes, then the helicity could change because the momentum direction is different. But helicity is a Lorentz-invariant quantity for massless particles. However, for massive particles, helicity can change under Lorentz transformations. Wait, but in an elastic collision, if the particle's direction reverses, then the spin projection would flip if the spin direction remains the same. But whether helicity is conserved depends on the interaction. In electromagnetic interactions, which are parity-conserving, helicity might not be conserved. For example, in electron scattering, the electron's helicity can change if it's deflected. So if a particle is scattered at an angle, its momentum direction changes, so helicity (which is spin dot momentum over magnitude) could change. Therefore, statement (b) is false. The helicity can change.\n\nPart (c): \"The angular distribution is always spherically symmetric.\" Spherical symmetry would mean the scattering probability is the same in all directions. But in reality, angular distribution depends on the interaction. For example, Rutherford scattering has a characteristic angular dependence (1/sin^4(theta/2)), which is not isotropic. In the COM frame, for elastic collisions, the angular distribution can vary. However, in some cases, like low-energy s-wave scattering, it might be isotropic, but generally, it's not. So statement (c) is false. The angular distribution isn't always spherically symmetric.\n\nSo summarizing: (a) is true, (b) and (c) are false. But wait, the options are (a), (b), (c). The question is probably a multiple-choice where each statement is to be evaluated as true or false. The user is asking which of these statements are correct. So the answer would be only (a) is correct.\n</think>\n\n(a) In the center of mass (COM) frame, the total momentum is zero. Before the collision, the particles move along a straight line, and after the collision, their trajectories must remain in the same plane due to momentum conservation and angular momentum constraints. Thus, **statement (a) is true**.  \n\n(b) Helicity, the projection of spin onto momentum direction, can change if the particle's momentum direction changes during the collision. For example, scattering at an angle alters the momentum direction, leading to a possible helicity change. **Statement (b) is false**.  \n\n(c) Angular distributions in elastic collisions depend on the interaction type (e.g., Rutherford scattering has a specific angular dependence). Spherical symmetry is not guaranteed and is typically absent except in special cases like isotropic low-energy scattering. **Statement (c) is false**.  \n\nFinal answer:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{a}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["a"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "a", "expr2": "(a)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "a", "expr2": "a"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-5", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the electron density changes as you move away from the center of an atom. The options are Gaussian decrease, exponential decrease, or oscillating with decreasing amplitude. Let me start by recalling what I know about electron density in atoms.\n\nElectron density refers to the probability of finding an electron in a particular region around the nucleus. In the hydrogen atom, for example, the wavefunctions (orbitals) determine this density. The simplest case is the 1s orbital, which has the highest probability density near the nucleus and decreases as you move away.\n\nFor the 1s orbital, the radial probability density is given by the square of the wavefunction. The wavefunction for 1s is proportional to e^(-r/a0), where a0 is the Bohr radius. Squaring that gives e^(-2r/a0), which means the probability density decreases exponentially with distance from the nucleus. So in this case, the electron density decreases exponentially. That would support option (b).\n\nBut wait, maybe other orbitals behave differently. For example, p, d, or f orbitals have nodes where the probability density drops to zero. However, the question is about the overall trend as you go away from the center. Even in those orbitals, beyond the nodes, does the density continue to decrease? For higher orbitals (like 2s, 2p, etc.), the radial part might have terms that include polynomials multiplied by an exponential decay. For instance, the 2s orbital has a radial function that includes (1 - r/(2a0))e^(-r/(2a0)). Squaring this would still lead to an exponential decay term dominating at large r. So even though there might be some oscillations or nodes close to the nucleus, as you move far away, the exponential term would dominate, leading to an overall exponential decrease.\n\nIn multi-electron atoms, the electron density is a combination of all occupied orbitals. The core electrons (those in lower energy levels) are closer to the nucleus, and their density drops off exponentially. The valence electrons are in higher orbitals, but even those have wavefunctions that decay exponentially at large distances. So the overall electron density, when you go far from the nucleus, should decrease exponentially. \n\nBut wait, the question says \"as one goes away from the center of an atom.\" So maybe considering all regions, not just the asymptotic (far away) region. For example, in the case of the 2p orbital, the radial distribution function has a maximum at a certain radius and then decreases. But the question is about electron density, not radial distribution. The electron density in p orbitals might have angular variations, but the radial part still has an exponential decay. However, in the case of core electrons, like 1s, the density drops off quickly. For valence electrons, maybe the decrease is slower, but still exponential.\n\nAnother angle: in molecules or solids, electron density can have different behaviors, but the question is about a single atom. So for an isolated atom, the electron density at large distances from the nucleus should decrease exponentially. This is because the wavefunctions of electrons in atoms are solutions to the Schrödinger equation under a Coulomb potential, and the solutions (especially for bound states) have exponential decay terms. The exponential decay is a general feature of bound states in quantum mechanics. \n\nSo putting this all together, the correct answer should be (b) decreases exponentially. The Gaussian decrease (option a) would be different; Gaussian functions decay faster than exponential (since e^(-x²) decays faster than e^(-x) as x increases). But atomic orbitals don't have Gaussian-type decay; they have exponential. Slater-type orbitals, for example, use exponential terms. So option (b) is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe electron density around an atom decreases exponentially as one moves away from the nucleus. This behavior arises from the nature of atomic orbitals, which are solutions to the Schrödinger equation for a Coulomb potential. For example, the 1s orbital's wavefunction is proportional to \\( e^{-r/a_0} \\), and squaring this gives an electron density proportional to \\( e^{-2r/a_0} \\), showing exponential decay. While higher orbitals (e.g., 2s, 2p) may have nodes or polynomial factors in their radial functions, the dominant term at large distances remains the exponential decay. This exponential trend holds for both core and valence electrons, as bound states in quantum mechanics universally exhibit exponential decay in their wavefunctions at large distances. \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{b}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["b"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "b", "expr2": "c"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "b", "expr2": "c"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/4-29", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The question is about finding the minimum gamma-ray energy needed for the reaction gamma + p → K+ + Lambda^0. Since the proton is initially at rest in the lab frame, this is a threshold energy problem. \n\nI remember that the threshold condition occurs when the kinetic energy of the incoming photon is just enough to produce the rest masses of the products, and all the products are at rest in the center-of-momentum frame. But wait, photons have zero rest mass, so their energy is entirely kinetic. The key formula here is probably the threshold energy formula for photoproduction. \n\nThe general formula for the threshold energy (E_gamma) when a photon hits a stationary proton should involve the sum of the rest masses of the products. Let me recall: the minimum photon energy required is when the total energy in the center-of-mass frame equals the sum of the rest energies of the products. \n\nThe rest masses given are m_K+ = 494 MeV/c², m_Lambda0 = 1116 MeV/c², and the proton's mass is m_p = 938 MeV/c² (I need to remember that, since it's not given here but is standard). The photon's energy is E_gamma, and the proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². \n\nThe total energy squared in the center-of-mass frame is (E_gamma + m_p c²)² - (p_gamma c)². Since the photon's momentum is E_gamma / c, the total momentum is E_gamma / c. So the invariant s is (E_gamma + m_p c²)² - (E_gamma c)^2. Wait, but units might be tricky here. Let me make sure all terms are in energy squared. \n\nAlternatively, using natural units where c=1, the invariant s is (E_gamma + m_p)^2 - (E_gamma)^2 = (m_K + m_Lambda)^2. Because at threshold, the products are at rest in the COM frame, so their total energy is just their rest masses. \n\nExpanding the left side: (E_gamma + m_p)^2 - E_gamma^2 = m_p² + 2 E_gamma m_p = (m_K + m_Lambda)^2. \n\nSolving for E_gamma: 2 E_gamma m_p = (m_K + m_Lambda)^2 - m_p². \n\nTherefore, E_gamma = [(m_K + m_Lambda)^2 - m_p²]/(2 m_p). \n\nPlugging in the numbers: m_K = 494, m_Lambda = 1116, m_p = 938. \n\nFirst compute (494 + 1116) = 1610. Then square that: 1610² = (1600 + 10)^2 = 1600² + 2*1600*10 + 10² = 2,560,000 + 32,000 + 100 = 2,592,100 (MeV²). \n\nThen subtract m_p squared: 938². Let's compute that: 900² = 810,000, 38²=1,444, and 2*900*38=68,400. So 938² = (900 + 38)^2 = 900² + 2*900*38 + 38² = 810,000 + 68,400 + 1,444 = 879,844 MeV². \n\nSo numerator is 2,592,100 - 879,844 = 1,712,256 MeV². \n\nDivide by 2 m_p: denominator is 2*938 = 1876 MeV. \n\nSo E_gamma = 1,712,256 / 1876 ≈ Let's compute that. \n\nFirst, 1,712,256 ÷ 1876. Let me approximate. \n\n1876 * 900 = 1,688,400. \n\nSubtract that from 1,712,256: 1,712,256 - 1,688,400 = 23,856. \n\nNow, 1876 * 12 = 22,512. \n\n23,856 - 22,512 = 1,344. \n\n1876 * 0.7 ≈ 1,313.2. \n\nSo total is 900 +12 +0.7 ≈ 912.7. \n\nBut let me check with exact division: 1,712,256 ÷ 1876. \n\nAlternatively, 1,712,256 ÷ 1876 ≈ 912.7 MeV. \n\nSo the minimum photon energy is approximately 912.7 MeV. Let me check if that's correct. \n\nWait, but let me verify the formula again. The threshold condition is when the total energy in the CM frame is equal to the sum of the rest masses. So the invariant s must be equal to (m_K + m_Lambda)^2. \n\nThe invariant s is (E_gamma + m_p)^2 - (E_gamma)^2, since the proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p and the photon's energy is E_gamma. The momentum of the photon is E_gamma (since p = E/c and c=1 in natural units). The proton's momentum is zero. So the total energy is E_gamma + m_p, and the total momentum is E_gamma. \n\nTherefore, s = (E_gamma + m_p)^2 - (E_gamma)^2 = m_p^2 + 2 E_gamma m_p. \n\nSetting this equal to (m_K + m_Lambda)^2 gives 2 E_gamma m_p = (m_K + m_Lambda)^2 - m_p^2. \n\nSo E_gamma = [(m_K + m_Lambda)^2 - m_p^2]/(2 m_p). \n\nYes, that's correct. So the calculation seems right. \n\nPlugging in the numbers again: \n\nm_K + m_Lambda = 494 + 1116 = 1610 MeV. \n\n(m_K + m_Lambda)^2 = 1610^2 = 2,592,100 MeV². \n\nm_p^2 = 938^2 = 879,844 MeV². \n\nDifference: 2,592,100 - 879,844 = 1,712,256 MeV². \n\nDivide by 2 m_p: 1,712,256 / (2*938) = 1,712,256 / 1876 ≈ 912.7 MeV. \n\nSo part (a) answer is approximately 913 MeV. \n\nBut let me check with exact calculation. \n\nCompute 1,712,256 ÷ 1876. \n\nLet me do this division step by step. \n\n1876 × 900 = 1,688,400. \n\nSubtract from 1,712,256: 1,712,256 - 1,688,400 = 23,856. \n\nNow, 1876 × 12 = 22,512. \n\n23,856 - 22,512 = 1,344. \n\n1876 × 0.7 = 1,313.2. \n\n1,344 - 1,313.2 = 30.8. \n\nSo total is 900 +12 +0.7 = 912.7, and then 30.8/1876 ≈ 0.0164. \n\nSo total is approximately 912.7164 ≈ 912.7 MeV. \n\nSo part (a) answer is approximately 913 MeV. \n\nMoving to part (b). The question is about the proton being bound in a nucleus, so Fermi motion allows the reaction to proceed with lower photon energy. We need to assume a reasonable Fermi momentum and compute the new minimum photon energy. \n\nFermi motion refers to the momentum distribution of nucleons in the nucleus. The typical Fermi momentum is around 250 MeV/c. So if the proton is moving towards the photon, even if the photon has lower energy, the effective energy in the proton's frame could be higher. \n\nTo compute the minimum photon energy, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the proton is moving in the opposite direction to the photon, so that their momenta add up in a way that reduces the required photon energy. \n\nWait, but actually, the idea is that if the proton has some momentum in the nucleus, then in the lab frame (where the nucleus is at rest), the proton's momentum can be in any direction. The minimum photon energy would occur when the proton is moving in the same direction as the photon, so that their velocities add, but actually, to lower the threshold, the proton should be moving opposite to the photon's direction. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the center-of-mass frame. \n\nAlternatively, the threshold condition is when the photon and proton have just enough energy in their center-of-mass frame to produce the K+ and Lambda. If the proton has some momentum in the lab frame, then even if the photon has lower energy, the combined energy in the CM frame could still reach the threshold. \n\nBut how to model this? Let's consider that the proton has a Fermi momentum p_F. The direction of the proton's momentum relative to the photon's direction will affect the total energy. To get the minimum photon energy, we need the proton's momentum to be opposite to the photon's direction. Because that way, the total momentum is reduced, and the required photon energy is lower. \n\nSo, in the lab frame, the proton has momentum p_p (Fermi momentum) opposite to the photon's direction. The photon has momentum E_gamma (since p = E/c, and c=1 in natural units). \n\nThe total energy in the lab frame is E_gamma + sqrt(p_p^2 + m_p^2). The total momentum is E_gamma - p_p (since they are in opposite directions). \n\nThe invariant s is (E_gamma + sqrt(p_p^2 + m_p^2))^2 - (E_gamma - p_p)^2. \n\nSet this equal to (m_K + m_Lambda)^2. \n\nSo expanding s: \n\n(E_gamma + sqrt(p_p^2 + m_p^2))^2 - (E_gamma - p_p)^2 \n\n= E_gamma^2 + 2 E_gamma sqrt(p_p^2 + m_p^2) + (p_p^2 + m_p^2) - [E_gamma^2 - 2 E_gamma p_p + p_p^2] \n\nSimplify term by term: \n\nFirst term: E_gamma^2 + 2 E_gamma sqrt(...) + p_p^2 + m_p^2 \n\nSecond term: -E_gamma^2 + 2 E_gamma p_p - p_p^2 \n\nCombine them: \n\nE_gamma^2 cancels. \n\n2 E_gamma sqrt(...) + p_p^2 + m_p^2 + 2 E_gamma p_p - p_p^2 \n\n= 2 E_gamma (sqrt(p_p^2 + m_p^2) + p_p) + m_p^2 \n\nSet equal to (m_K + m_Lambda)^2: \n\n2 E_gamma (sqrt(p_p^2 + m_p^2) + p_p) + m_p^2 = (m_K + m_Lambda)^2 \n\nSolve for E_gamma: \n\nE_gamma = [(m_K + m_Lambda)^2 - m_p^2] / [2 (sqrt(p_p^2 + m_p^2) + p_p)] \n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can model the proton's momentum as a Fermi momentum, say p_F ≈ 250 MeV/c. Then, in the lab frame, the proton has momentum p_p = 250 MeV/c in some direction. To minimize the photon energy, the proton should be moving opposite to the photon's direction. \n\nBut maybe a simpler approach is to consider that the proton's Fermi energy allows it to have a certain kinetic energy, so the effective mass seen by the photon is lower. Wait, that might not be the right approach. \n\nAlternatively, think of the photon and proton moving towards each other. The minimum photon energy would be when the proton is moving opposite to the photon's direction with maximum Fermi momentum. \n\nAssume the proton has momentum p_p = 250 MeV/c (a typical Fermi momentum) opposite to the photon's direction. Then, the total energy in the lab frame is E_gamma + E_p, where E_p = sqrt(p_p^2 + m_p^2). The total momentum is E_gamma - p_p. \n\nThe invariant s is (E_gamma + E_p)^2 - (E_gamma - p_p)^2. \n\nSet this equal to (m_K + m_Lambda)^2. \n\nLet me compute this. \n\ns = (E_gamma + E_p)^2 - (E_gamma - p_p)^2 \n\n= [E_gamma^2 + 2 E_gamma E_p + E_p^2] - [E_gamma^2 - 2 E_gamma p_p + p_p^2] \n\n= 2 E_gamma E_p + E_p^2 + 2 E_gamma p_p - p_p^2 \n\nBut E_p^2 = p_p^2 + m_p^2, so substituting: \n\n= 2 E_gamma (E_p + p_p) + (p_p^2 + m_p^2) - p_p^2 \n\n= 2 E_gamma (E_p + p_p) + m_p^2 \n\nSet equal to (m_K + m_Lambda)^2: \n\n2 E_gamma (E_p + p_p) + m_p^2 = (m_K + m_Lambda)^2 \n\nSo solving for E_gamma: \n\nE_gamma = [(m_K + m_Lambda)^2 - m_p^2] / [2 (E_p + p_p)] \n\nBut E_p = sqrt(p_p^2 + m_p^2). Let's plug in p_p = 250 MeV/c. \n\nFirst, compute E_p: sqrt(250² + 938²) = sqrt(62,500 + 880, 144) = sqrt(942,644). Let's compute sqrt(942,644). \n\nApproximate: 970² = 940,900. 971² = 942,841. So sqrt(942,644) ≈ 970.9 MeV. \n\nSo E_p ≈ 970.9 MeV. \n\nThen E_p + p_p ≈ 970.9 + 250 = 1220.9 MeV. \n\nThe numerator is the same as in part (a): (1610)^2 - (938)^2 = 1,712,256 MeV². \n\nSo E_gamma = 1,712,256 / (2 * 1220.9) ≈ 1,712,256 / 2441.8 ≈ Let's compute this. \n\n2441.8 × 700 = 1,709,260. \n\n1,712,256 - 1,709,260 = 2,996. \n\n2441.8 × 1.2 ≈ 2,930.16 \n\nSo 700 +1.2 = 701.2, and remaining 2,996 -2,930.16=65.84. \n\n65.84 /2441.8 ≈0.027. \n\nTotal ≈701.2 +0.027≈701.227 MeV. \n\nSo approximately 701.2 MeV. \n\nBut let me check with exact numbers. \n\nNumerator: 1,712,256 \n\nDenominator: 2*(970.9 +250) = 2*1220.9=2441.8 \n\n1,712,256 ÷ 2441.8 ≈ 701.2 MeV. \n\nSo the minimum photon energy is reduced from ~913 MeV to ~701 MeV if the proton has a Fermi momentum of 250 MeV/c opposite to the photon's direction. \n\nBut the problem says to assume a reasonable value for the Fermi motion. Typically, Fermi momentum is around 250 MeV/c, so that's a reasonable assumption. \n\nTherefore, part (b) answer is approximately 701 MeV. \n\nNow part (c): The Lambda^0 decays in flight into a proton and a pi^- meson. The Lambda has a velocity of 0.8c. We need to find (i) the maximum momentum of the pi^- in the lab frame, and (ii) the maximum component of lab momentum perpendicular to the Lambda's direction. \n\nFirst, the decay process is Lambda^0 → p + pi^-. \n\nIn the rest frame of the Lambda, the maximum momentum of the pion occurs when the pion is emitted in the direction opposite to the proton, but actually, maximum momentum in the lab frame would be when the pion is emitted in the same direction as the Lambda's motion. \n\nBut to find the maximum momentum in the lab frame, we need to consider the decay kinematics. \n\nFirst, calculate the energy and momentum of the Lambda in the lab frame. The Lambda has velocity 0.8c, so its gamma factor is gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.64) = 1/sqrt(0.36) = 1/0.6 ≈1.6667. \n\nThe energy of the Lambda is gamma*m_Lambda*c², and its momentum is gamma*m_Lambda*v. \n\nBut let's use natural units (c=1). So gamma = 5/3 ≈1.6667. \n\nEnergy E_Lambda = gamma*m_Lambda = (5/3)*1116 MeV ≈ 1860 MeV. \n\nMomentum p_Lambda = gamma*m_Lambda*v = (5/3)*1116*0.8 = (5/3)*892.8 ≈ 1488 MeV. \n\nWait, let's compute that properly. \n\nv = 0.8c, so beta = 0.8. \n\ngamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.64) = 1/sqrt(0.36) = 1/0.6 = 5/3 ≈1.6667. \n\np_Lambda = gamma * m_Lambda * beta = (5/3)*1116*0.8 = (5/3)*892.8 = (5 * 892.8)/3 = 4464/3 ≈1488 MeV/c. \n\nSo the Lambda has momentum 1488 MeV/c in the lab frame. \n\nNow, in the Lambda's rest frame, the decay products (proton and pion) have certain momenta. The maximum momentum of the pion in the lab frame will occur when the pion is emitted in the same direction as the Lambda's motion. \n\nFirst, find the energy and momentum of the pion in the Lambda's rest frame. \n\nThe decay is Lambda → p + pi^-. \n\nThe rest mass of Lambda is 1116 MeV, proton is 938 MeV, pion is 140 MeV. \n\nIn the rest frame of the Lambda, the total energy is m_Lambda. The proton and pion will have energies E_p and E_pi, and their momenta will be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. \n\nUsing conservation of energy and momentum: \n\nE_p + E_pi = m_Lambda \n\n|p_p| = |p_pi| = p \n\nSo, E_p = sqrt(p² + m_p²) \n\nE_pi = sqrt(p² + m_pi²) \n\nThus: \n\nsqrt(p² + m_p²) + sqrt(p² + m_pi²) = m_Lambda \n\nWe need to solve for p. \n\nLet me denote m_Lambda = M, m_p = m1, m_pi = m2. \n\nSo sqrt(p² + m1²) + sqrt(p² + m2²) = M \n\nThis equation can be squared to solve for p. \n\nLet me square both sides: \n\n[sqrt(p² + m1²) + sqrt(p² + m2²)]² = M² \n\n=> p² + m1² + p² + m2² + 2 sqrt{(p² + m1²)(p² + m2²)} = M² \n\nCombine terms: \n\n2p² + m1² + m2² + 2 sqrt{(p² + m1²)(p² + m2²)} = M² \n\nLet me rearrange: \n\n2 sqrt{(p² + m1²)(p² + m2²)} = M² - 2p² - m1² - m2² \n\nSquare both sides again: \n\n4 (p² + m1²)(p² + m2²) = [M² - 2p² - m1² - m2²]^2 \n\nThis will get messy, but perhaps there's a simpler way. Alternatively, use the formula for two-body decay. \n\nThe magnitude of the momentum of each decay product in the rest frame is given by: \n\np = [ (M² - (m1 + m2)^2)(M² - (m1 - m2)^2) ]^(1/2) / (2M) \n\nPlugging in M = 1116 MeV, m1 = 938 MeV, m2 = 140 MeV. \n\nCompute numerator: \n\n(M² - (m1 + m2)^2) = 1116² - (938 +140)^2 = 1116² - 1078² \n\nSimilarly, (M² - (m1 - m2)^2) = 1116² - (938 -140)^2 = 1116² - 798² \n\nCompute each term: \n\nFirst term: 1116² -1078² = (1116 -1078)(1116 +1078) = (38)(2194) = 38*2000 +38*194 =76,000 +7,372=83,372 \n\nSecond term: 1116² -798² = (1116 -798)(1116 +798) = (318)(1914) \n\nCalculate 318*1914: \n\n318*2000=636,000 minus 318*86=27,348 → 636,000 -27,348=608,652 \n\nSo the product of the two terms is 83,372 * 608,652. \n\nTake the square root of the product: sqrt(83,372 *608,652). \n\nBut this seems complicated. Let me compute p using the formula. \n\np = sqrt( [ (M² - (m1 + m2)^2)(M² - (m1 - m2)^2) ] ) / (2M) \n\nSo compute each part: \n\nFirst term: M² - (m1 + m2)^2 = 1116² -1078² = (1116 -1078)(1116 +1078) =38*2194=83,372 \n\nSecond term: M² - (m1 - m2)^2 =1116² -798²= (1116 -798)(1116 +798)=318*1914=608,652 \n\nMultiply them:83,372 *608,652 ≈ Let's approximate. \n\nBut maybe we can factor this. \n\nAlternatively, compute sqrt(83,372 *608,652) = sqrt(83,372 *608,652). \n\nBut perhaps we can compute this as sqrt(83,372 *608,652) ≈ sqrt(83,372) * sqrt(608,652). \n\nsqrt(83,372) ≈ 288.7 (since 288^2=82,944 and 289^2=83,521). So approximately 288.7. \n\nsqrt(608,652) ≈ 780 (780^2=608,400). So approximately 780. \n\nThus, product ≈288.7 *780 ≈225,186. \n\nThen divide by 2M =2*1116=2232. \n\nSo p ≈225,186 /2232 ≈100.9 MeV/c. \n\nBut let's compute more accurately. \n\nAlternatively, use exact calculation. \n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me check with actual values. \n\nAlternatively, use the formula for p in two-body decay: \n\np = [M² - (m1 + m2)^2]^(1/2) * [M² - (m1 - m2)^2]^(1/2) / (2M) \n\nBut this is equivalent to the previous expression. \n\nAlternatively, use energy conservation. Let's try plugging in numbers. \n\nLet me compute p numerically. \n\nLet me compute M² =1116²=1,245,456 \n\n(m1 +m2)^2=(938+140)^2=1078²=1,162,084 \n\n(m1 -m2)^2=(938-140)^2=798²=636,804 \n\nSo [M² - (m1 +m2)^2]=1,245,456 -1,162,084=83,372 \n\n[M² - (m1 -m2)^2]=1,245,456 -636,804=608,652 \n\nMultiply these two:83,372 *608,652= Let's compute this. \n\n83,372 *600,000=50,023,200,000 \n\n83,372 *8,652= Let's compute 83,372 *8,000=666,976,000 \n\n83,372 *652=83,372*600=50,023,200; 83,372*52=4,333, 344 \n\nTotal 50,023,200 +4,333,344=54,356,544 \n\nSo total 666,976,000 +54,356,544=721,332,544 \n\nTotal product:50,023,200,000 +721,332,544=50,744,532,544 \n\nNow take the square root: sqrt(50,744,532,544). Let's see. \n\nWhat's 225,000²=50,625,000,000. \n\n225,000²=50,625,000,000 \n\nSubtract:50,744,532,544 -50,625,000,000=119,532,544 \n\nNow, (225,000 + x)^2 =50,625,000,000 +450,000 x +x² \n\nSet equal to50,744,532,544: \n\n450,000 x +x²=119,532,544 \n\nAssume x=265: \n\n450,000*265=119,250,000 \n\n265²=70,225 \n\nTotal 119,250,000 +70,225=119,320,225 \n\nWhich is slightly higher than 119,532,544. \n\nSo x≈265. \n\nThus sqrt≈225,265. \n\nSo sqrt(50,744,532,544)≈225,265. \n\nThen divide by 2M=2*1116=2232. \n\np≈225,265 /2232≈100.9 MeV/c. \n\nSo in the Lambda rest frame, the pion has momentum approximately 100.9 MeV/c. \n\nBut let's check with exact calculation. \n\nAlternatively, use energy conservation. \n\nIn the Lambda rest frame: \n\nE_p = sqrt(p² +938²) \n\nE_pi = sqrt(p² +140²) \n\nE_p + E_pi =1116 \n\nLet me plug p=100.9 MeV/c. \n\nE_p = sqrt(100.9² +938²) ≈sqrt(10,180.81 +880, 144)=sqrt(890,324.81)≈943.6 MeV \n\nE_pi = sqrt(100.9² +140²)=sqrt(10,180.81 +19,600)=sqrt(29,780.81)≈172.6 MeV \n\nTotal E_p + E_pi ≈943.6 +172.6=1116.2 MeV, which matches the Lambda mass. So p≈100.9 MeV/c is correct. \n\nSo in the Lambda rest frame, the pion has momentum p_pi_rest ≈100.9 MeV/c. \n\nNow, to find the maximum momentum of the pion in the lab frame, we need to boost the pion's momentum from the Lambda rest frame to the lab frame where the Lambda is moving at 0.8c. \n\nThe maximum momentum occurs when the pion is emitted in the same direction as the Lambda's motion. \n\nThe Lorentz transformation for momentum and energy from the Lambda's rest frame (primed) to the lab frame (unprimed) is: \n\np_parallel = gamma (p'_parallel + beta E') \n\nE = gamma (E' + beta p'_parallel) \n\nSince the pion's momentum in the Lambda rest frame can be in any direction, the maximum lab frame momentum occurs when p'_parallel is in the same direction as the Lambda's motion (i.e., positive direction). \n\nSo, p'_parallel = +100.9 MeV/c \n\nE'_pi = sqrt( (100.9)^2 + (140)^2 ) ≈172.6 MeV \n\nThen, using beta=0.8, gamma=5/3≈1.6667. \n\np_lab_parallel = gamma (p'_parallel + beta E'_pi) \n\n= (5/3) [100.9 +0.8*172.6] \n\nCompute inside the brackets: \n\n0.8*172.6=138.08 \n\n100.9 +138.08=238.98 \n\nMultiply by 5/3:238.98*(5/3)=238.98*1.6667≈398.3 MeV/c \n\nSo the maximum momentum of the pion in the lab frame is approximately 398.3 MeV/c. \n\nBut let me check the exact calculation. \n\nE'_pi =172.6 MeV \n\np'_parallel=100.9 MeV/c \n\nbeta=0.8 \n\ngamma=5/3 \n\np_lab_parallel = (5/3)*(100.9 +0.8*172.6) \n\nCalculate 0.8*172.6=138.08 \n\n100.9 +138.08=238.98 \n\nMultiply by 5/3:238.98 *5=1,194.9 \n\nDivide by3:1,194.9/3=398.3 MeV/c. \n\nSo part (c)(i) answer is approximately 398 MeV/c. \n\nFor part (c)(ii), the maximum component of lab momentum perpendicular to the Lambda's direction. \n\nIn the lab frame, the perpendicular component of momentum is the same as the perpendicular component in the Lambda's rest frame, scaled by 1/gamma. Because under a Lorentz boost in the x-direction, the y and z components transform as p_y' = p_y / gamma (if there's no velocity in y-direction). Wait, actually, the transverse momentum (perpendicular to the boost direction) is p_perp' = p_perp / gamma. \n\nWait, the Lorentz transformation for transverse momentum is p_y = (p'_y + gamma beta E'_y/c ) / gamma (but since the boost is along x, the y and z components are not affected by the velocity. Wait, no. \n\nActually, when you boost along the x-direction, the y and z components of momentum transform as: \n\np_y = p'_y / gamma (1 - beta v'_x / c²) \n\nBut if the particle is moving in the x-direction in the rest frame, then v'_x is its velocity in that frame. However, for the pion emitted perpendicular to the x-direction in the Lambda's rest frame (i.e., p'_x=0, p'_y=p_perp), then the lab frame momentum components would be: \n\np_x = gamma (p'_x + beta E') = gamma beta E' \n\np_y = p'_y \n\nBut wait, no. Let me recall the Lorentz transformation for momentum. \n\nThe Lorentz transformations for momentum and energy when boosting in the x-direction are: \n\np_x = gamma (p'_x + beta E') \n\np_y = p'_y / gamma \n\np_z = p'_z / gamma \n\nE = gamma (E' + beta p'_x) \n\nSo if the pion is emitted perpendicular to the Lambda's motion in the rest frame (i.e., p'_x=0, p'_y=p_perp, p'_z=0), then in the lab frame: \n\np_x = gamma (0 + beta E') = gamma beta E' \n\np_y = p'_y / gamma \n\np_z =0 \n\nSo the perpendicular component (p_y) in the lab frame is p'_y / gamma. \n\nTo maximize the perpendicular component in the lab frame, we need to maximize p'_y. The maximum p'_y occurs when the pion is emitted perpendicular to the x-direction in the Lambda's rest frame, i.e., p'_x=0, p'_y=100.9 MeV/c (since in the rest frame, the maximum transverse momentum is when the pion is emitted at 90 degrees, but wait, in the rest frame, the pion's momentum can have any direction. The maximum transverse momentum in the lab frame would be when the pion is emitted perpendicularly in the rest frame. \n\nWait, but in the rest frame, the pion's momentum can be in any direction. The maximum perpendicular component in the lab frame would be when the pion is emitted perpendicularly in the rest frame. \n\nIn that case, p'_x=0, p'_y=100.9 MeV/c (since the magnitude is 100.9), and p'_z=0. \n\nThen, in the lab frame, p_y = p'_y / gamma =100.9 / (5/3)=100.9 *3/5=60.54 MeV/c. \n\nSo the maximum perpendicular component is approximately 60.5 MeV/c. \n\nBut wait, is that the maximum possible? Suppose the pion is emitted at some angle in the rest frame such that the transverse component in the lab is maximized. \n\nWait, but according to the Lorentz transformation, the transverse momentum in the lab is p'_y / gamma. So to maximize p_y, we need to maximize p'_y. The maximum p'_y is 100.9 MeV/c (when the pion is emitted perpendicularly in the rest frame). Therefore, the maximum perpendicular component is 100.9 / (5/3)=60.54 MeV/c. \n\nThus, part (c)(ii) answer is approximately 60.5 MeV/c. \n\nBut let me verify this. \n\nIf the pion is emitted at an angle theta in the rest frame, then p'_x = p cos(theta), p'_y = p sin(theta). \n\nIn the lab frame, p_x = gamma (p cos(theta) + beta E') \n\np_y = p sin(theta) / gamma \n\nTo maximize p_y, we need to maximize sin(theta), which is maximum at theta=90 degrees. So yes, the maximum p_y in the lab is p / gamma =100.9 / (5/3)=60.54 MeV/c. \n\nTherefore, the answers are: \n\n(c)(i) ~398 MeV/c \n\n(c)(ii) ~60.5 MeV/c \n\nSummarizing all parts: \n\n(a) ~913 MeV \n\n(b) ~701 MeV \n\n(c)(i) ~398 MeV/c \n\n(c)(ii) ~60.5 MeV/c \n\nBut let me check if there are any calculation errors. \n\nFor part (c)(i), when boosting the pion's momentum in the same direction as the Lambda's motion, the calculation gives 398 MeV/c. That seems correct. \n\nFor part (c)(ii), the maximum perpendicular component is indeed p'_y / gamma, which is 100.9 / (5/3)=60.54 MeV/c. \n\nYes, these seem correct. \n\nFinal answers: \n\n(a) 913 MeV \n\n(b) 701 MeV \n\n(c)(i) 398 MeV/c \n\n(c)(ii) 60.5 MeV/c \n\nBut let me present them with exact expressions where possible. \n\nFor part (a), the exact value is [(1610)^2 -938^2]/(2*938)=1,712,256/(1876)=912.7 MeV. \n\nSimilarly, part (b) with p_p=250 MeV/c gives E_gamma≈701 MeV. \n\nPart (c)(i) is approximately 398 MeV/c, and (ii) 60.5 MeV/c. \n\nSo the final answers in boxed form are: \n\n(a) \\boxed{913 \\ \\text{MeV}} \n\n(b) \\boxed{701 \\ \\text{MeV}} \n\n(c)(i) \\boxed{398 \\ \\text{MeV}/c} \n\n(c)(ii) \\boxed{60.5 \\ \\text{MeV}/c}\n</think>\n\n(a) The minimum photon energy required is calculated using the threshold condition where the total energy in the center-of-mass frame equals the sum of the rest masses of the products.

{"id": "atomic/1-2", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the mass of black body radiation per cubic centimeter at a temperature of 10^10 K. The options are 1 ton, 1 gram, 10^-6 grams, or 10^-16 grams. Hmm, let's start by recalling what black body radiation is. Black body radiation is the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a body that absorbs all incident radiation. At thermal equilibrium, the radiation has a spectrum determined by the temperature. \n\nBut the question is about the \"weight\" or mass of this radiation per cm³. Wait, radiation is massless photons, right? But according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, energy does have an equivalent mass. So maybe they're asking for the equivalent mass based on the energy density of the black body radiation.\n\nRight, the energy density of black body radiation is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy density u is proportional to T^4. The formula is u = (8π^5 k^4)/(15 h^3 c^3) * T^4. But maybe I can remember the constant value. Alternatively, the Stefan-Boltzmann constant σ is known, but σ is related to the power radiated per unit area. Wait, the energy density u is actually (4σ/c) * T^4. Wait, let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, the energy density for black body radiation is given by u = a T^4, where a is the radiation constant. The radiation constant a is 4σ/c, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The value of σ is approximately 5.67×10^-8 W m^-2 K^-4. But maybe I should use the exact expression with fundamental constants.\n\nAlternatively, the energy density u can be calculated using the formula u = (π²/15) (k_B T)^4 / (ħ³ c³). Let me confirm that. The energy density for photons in black body radiation is given by integrating the Planck distribution over all frequencies and multiplying by the energy per photon. The integral results in a proportionality to T^4. The exact expression is u = (8π^5 k^4)/(15 h^3 c^3) T^4. Let me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall the values of the constants:\n\n- Planck's constant h = 6.626×10^-34 J s\n- Reduced Planck constant ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.054×10^-34 J s\n- Boltzmann constant k_B = 1.38×10^-23 J/K\n- Speed of light c = 3×10^8 m/s\n\nBut maybe using the formula u = a T^4 where a is 7.56×10^-16 J m^-3 K^-4. Wait, I think the radiation constant a is 8π^5 k^4/(15 h^3 c^3). Let me compute that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look up the value of the radiation constant. Let me recall that the Stefan-Boltzmann constant σ is 5.67×10^-8 W m^-2 K^-4, and the energy density u is related to the power radiated. The power per unit area is σ T^4, and the energy density is 4σ/c * T^4. So u = (4σ/c) T^4. Let's check that.\n\nYes, because the power radiated per unit area is the energy flux, which is (c u)/4 for isotropic radiation. So setting σ T^4 = (c u)/4, solving for u gives u = 4σ T^4 / c. Therefore, u = (4 * 5.67×10^-8 W m^-2 K^-4 / 3×10^8 m/s) * T^4. Let's compute the coefficient:\n\n4 * 5.67e-8 / 3e8 = (22.68e-8) / 3e8 = 7.56e-16 J m^-3 K^-4. So yes, the radiation constant a is 7.56×10^-16 J m^-3 K^-4. Therefore, u = a T^4.\n\nSo at T = 10^10 K, u = 7.56e-16 J/m³/K⁴ * (1e10 K)^4. Let's compute that:\n\n(1e10)^4 = 1e40, so u = 7.56e-16 * 1e40 = 7.56e24 J/m³. \n\nWait, that's a huge energy density. Now, converting this energy density into mass density using E = mc². So the mass density ρ = u / c².\n\nCompute ρ = 7.56e24 J/m³ / (9e16 m²/s²) = 7.56e24 / 9e16 = 8.4e7 kg/m³. \n\nWait, 8.4e7 kg per cubic meter. Let's convert that to grams per cubic centimeter. Since 1 kg = 1000 grams, and 1 m³ = 1e6 liters = 1e6 (dm³) = 1e6 * 1000 cm³ = 1e6 * 1e3 cm³ = 1e9 cm³. Wait, 1 m³ = (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³. Wait, no: 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 m³ = (100 cm)^3 = 1,000,000 cm³ = 1e6 cm³. So 1 m³ = 1e6 cm³.\n\nTherefore, 8.4e7 kg/m³ = 8.4e7 kg / 1e6 cm³ = 8.4e1 kg/cm³ = 84 kg/cm³. Wait, that's 84 kilograms per cubic centimeter. But the options are in tons, grams, etc. 84 kg is 0.084 tons (since 1 ton is 1000 kg). So 0.084 tons per cm³? But the options are 1 ton, 1g, etc. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let's check the steps again. Starting from u = a T^4. a is 7.56e-16 J/m³/K⁴. T is 1e10 K. So u = 7.56e-16 * (1e10)^4. Let's compute (1e10)^4: 1e40. So 7.56e-16 * 1e40 = 7.56e24 J/m³. Then converting to mass density: ρ = u / c². c is 3e8 m/s. c² is 9e16 m²/s². So ρ = 7.56e24 / 9e16 = 8.4e7 kg/m³. Then converting kg/m³ to grams/cm³: 1 kg/m³ = 1e-3 g / 1e6 cm³ = 1e-3 / 1e6 = 1e-9 g/cm³. Therefore, 8.4e7 kg/m³ = 8.4e7 * 1e-9 g/cm³ = 8.4e-2 g/cm³. Wait, that's 0.084 grams per cm³. Wait, that's different from before. Wait, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, yes! The conversion from kg/m³ to g/cm³. Let me redo that. 1 kg = 1000 g. 1 m³ = (100 cm)^3 = 1,000,000 cm³ (1e6 cm³). Therefore, 1 kg/m³ = 1000 g / 1e6 cm³ = 0.001 g/cm³ = 1e-3 g/cm³. So, 8.4e7 kg/m³ = 8.4e7 * 1e-3 g/cm³ = 8.4e4 g/cm³. Wait, that's 84,000 grams per cm³. Which is 84 kg per cm³. Wait, but that's conflicting with the previous step. Wait, no. Let me do it step by step.\n\nIf ρ is 8.4e7 kg/m³, then:\n\n1 kg/m³ = 0.001 g/cm³ (since 1 kg = 1000 g, and 1 m³ = 1e6 cm³, so 1 kg/m³ = 1000 g / 1e6 cm³ = 0.001 g/cm³).\n\nTherefore, 8.4e7 kg/m³ = 8.4e7 * 0.001 g/cm³ = 8.4e4 g/cm³. That's 84,000 grams per cubic centimeter. Which is 84 kg per cm³, which is 0.084 tons per cm³ (since 1 ton is 1000 kg). So 84 kg/cm³ is 0.084 tons/cm³. But the options are 1 ton, 1g, 1e-6 g, 1e-16 g. None of these match 0.084 tons. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the exponent in the radiation constant. Let me double-check the value of the radiation constant a. The radiation constant a is 4σ/c. σ is 5.670374419e-8 W m^-2 K^-4. So a = 4 * 5.670374419e-8 / 3e8 = (2.2681497676e-7) / 3e8 = 7.560499225e-16 J m^-3 K^-4. So that part is correct.\n\nThen u = a T^4 = 7.56e-16 * (1e10)^4 = 7.56e-16 * 1e40 = 7.56e24 J/m³. Then converting to mass density: ρ = u / c² = 7.56e24 / (9e16) = 8.4e7 kg/m³. Then converting kg/m³ to g/cm³: 8.4e7 kg/m³ = 8.4e7 * 1e3 g/m³ = 8.4e10 g/m³. Since 1 m³ = 1e6 cm³, then 8.4e10 g/m³ = 8.4e10 g / 1e6 cm³ = 8.4e4 g/cm³. So 84,000 g/cm³. That's 8.4e4 grams per cm³. Which is 84 kg per cm³. But the options don't have 84 kg or 0.084 tons. The options are 1 ton, 1 gram, etc. So this suggests that my calculation is wrong. But where?\n\nWait, maybe the temperature is given as 10^10 K, but in the formula, the temperature should be in some other unit? No, the Stefan-Boltzmann law uses Kelvin. So that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the radiation energy density in terms of mass density, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps.\n\nWait, let's check the exponents again. Let's compute (1e10)^4. 1e10 to the fourth power is (1e10)^4 = 1e40. Correct. Then 7.56e-16 * 1e40 = 7.56e24 J/m³. Correct. Then dividing by c²: 7.56e24 / (9e16) = 8.4e7 kg/m³. Correct. Then converting kg/m³ to g/cm³: 1 kg/m³ = 1e3 g / 1e6 cm³ = 1e-3 g/cm³. Therefore, 8.4e7 kg/m³ = 8.4e7 * 1e-3 g/cm³ = 8.4e4 g/cm³. Yes, that's 84,000 g/cm³, which is 84 kg/cm³, which is 0.084 tons/cm³. But none of the options are close to 0.084 tons. The options are 1 ton, 1 gram, 1e-6 grams, 1e-16 grams. So this suggests that my answer is not among the options. Therefore, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using a different definition of \"weighs\". Maybe they are considering the radiation's energy density as equivalent mass via E=mc², but maybe I messed up the units somewhere. Let me check the steps again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the energy density in ergs instead of Joules, since sometimes in physics, especially older texts, ergs are used. Let's see. 1 J = 1e7 erg. So if I compute u in erg/cm³, maybe that would help.\n\nLet me try that approach. Starting over:\n\nu = a T^4, where a = 7.56e-16 J/m³/K⁴. Convert a to erg/cm³/K⁴.\n\n1 J = 1e7 erg, 1 m³ = 1e6 cm³. So 1 J/m³ = 1e7 erg / 1e6 cm³ = 10 erg/cm³. Therefore, a = 7.56e-16 J/m³/K⁴ = 7.56e-16 * 10 erg/cm³/K⁴ = 7.56e-15 erg/cm³/K⁴.\n\nThen u = 7.56e-15 erg/cm³/K⁴ * (1e10 K)^4 = 7.56e-15 * 1e40 = 7.56e25 erg/cm³.\n\nNow, convert erg to grams using E=mc². 1 erg = 1 g cm²/s². So E = mc² => m = E/(c²). Here, c is in cm/s: c = 3e10 cm/s. So c² = 9e20 cm²/s².\n\nTherefore, m = 7.56e25 erg/cm³ / (9e20 cm²/s²) = 7.56e25 / 9e20 * (g cm²/s²) / (cm²/s²) / cm³) = 7.56e25 / 9e20 g/cm³ = 8.4e4 g/cm³. Same result as before. So 8.4e4 grams per cm³. Still 84,000 g/cm³. Which is 84 kg/cm³. So 0.084 tons/cm³. But the options are 1 ton, 1g, etc. So this is not matching. Therefore, there must be an error in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe the question is referring to the radiation's energy density as equivalent mass density, but perhaps I used the wrong formula. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the rest mass of photons, but photons are massless. So their rest mass is zero. But if you consider the relativistic mass, which is E/c², then that's what I calculated. So that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the temperature is 10^10 K, but in the formula, the energy density is proportional to T^4, but perhaps I should use the energy density in terms of the photon gas. Wait, but I think the approach is correct. So why is the answer not matching the options?\n\nWait, let's check the order of magnitude. 10^10 K is an extremely high temperature. For comparison, the Sun's core temperature is about 1.5e7 K. At such high temperatures, the energy density would be enormous. But according to the calculation, the mass equivalent is 84 kg/cm³, which is extremely dense, much denser than any ordinary matter. But the options given are 1 ton (1000 kg), 1 gram, etc. So 84 kg/cm³ is 0.084 tons/cm³, which is not one of the options. The closest option would be 1 ton, but it's off by an order of magnitude. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent.\n\nWait, let's check the exponents again. Let's compute (1e10)^4. 1e10 to the fourth is 1e40. Correct. Then 7.56e-16 * 1e40 = 7.56e24 J/m³. Correct. Then dividing by c²: 7.56e24 / 9e16 = 8.4e7 kg/m³. Correct. Then converting to g/cm³: 8.4e7 kg/m³ = 8.4e7 * 1e3 g/m³ / 1e6 cm³/m³ = 8.4e10 g/m³ / 1e6 cm³/m³ = 8.4e4 g/cm³. Correct. So 8.4e4 grams per cm³. That's 84,000 grams per cm³. Which is 84 kg per cm³. So 0.084 tons per cm³. But the options are 1 ton, 1 gram, etc. So none of the options match. Therefore, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is in error, or maybe I'm missing a factor. Let me think again. The energy density of black body radiation is u = (π²/15) (k_B T)^4 / (ħ³ c³). Let me compute this directly using constants.\n\nLet's compute u using this formula:\n\nu = (π²/15) * (k_B T)^4 / (ħ³ c³)\n\nGiven:\n\nk_B = 1.38e-23 J/K\n\nT = 1e10 K\n\nħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nCompute (k_B T)^4:\n\n(1.38e-23 J/K * 1e10 K) = 1.38e-13 J\n\nRaise to 4th power: (1.38e-13)^4 = (1.38)^4 * 1e-52 = approx 3.6 * 1e-52 = 3.6e-52 J^4\n\nThen divide by ħ^3 c^3:\n\nħ^3 = (1.05e-34)^3 ≈ 1.16e-102 J^3 s^3\n\nc^3 = (3e8)^3 = 2.7e24 m^3/s^3\n\nSo denominator: 1.16e-102 * 2.7e24 = 3.13e-78 J^3 s^3 m^3/s^3 = 3.13e-78 J^3 m^3\n\nWait, units are getting complicated. Let's just compute the numerical value.\n\nSo u = (π²/15) * (3.6e-52) / (3.13e-78)\n\nCompute numerator: π²/15 ≈ 9.8696/15 ≈ 0.658\n\nNumerator: 0.658 * 3.6e-52 ≈ 2.37e-52\n\nDenominator: 3.13e-78\n\nSo u ≈ 2.37e-52 / 3.13e-78 ≈ 7.57e25 J/m³\n\nWhich matches the previous value of 7.56e24 J/m³? Wait, no, this is 7.57e25 J/m³, which is an order of magnitude higher. Wait, this discrepancy suggests I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let's compute (k_B T)^4:\n\nk_B T = 1.38e-23 J/K * 1e10 K = 1.38e-13 J\n\n(k_B T)^4 = (1.38e-13)^4 = (1.38)^4 * 1e-52 = approx 3.6 * 1e-52 = 3.6e-52 J^4\n\nThen ħ^3 = (1.0545718e-34)^3 ≈ 1.17e-102 J^3 s^3\n\nc^3 = (3e8)^3 = 2.7e24 m^3/s^3\n\nDenominator: ħ^3 c^3 = 1.17e-102 * 2.7e24 = 3.16e-78 J^3 s^3 m^3/s^3 = 3.16e-78 J^3 m^3\n\nWait, the units here are a bit confusing. Let's not get bogged down by units and focus on the numerical values.\n\nSo u = (π²/15) * (3.6e-52) / (3.16e-78) ≈ (0.658) * (3.6e-52) / (3.16e-78) ≈ 0.658 * 1.14e26 ≈ 0.658 * 1.14e26 ≈ 7.5e25 J/m³\n\nWhich is 7.5e25 J/m³, which is higher than the previous calculation of 7.56e24 J/m³. So there's a discrepancy here. Why?\n\nAh, because the formula I used earlier (u = a T^4 where a = 7.56e-16 J/m³/K⁴) gives u = 7.56e-16 * (1e10)^4 = 7.56e24 J/m³. But using the other formula, I get 7.5e25 J/m³. So there's a factor of 10 difference. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me check the correct formula for the energy density of black body radiation. The energy density u is given by:\n\nu = (8π^5 k_B^4)/(15 h^3 c^3) * T^4\n\nLet's compute this constant factor:\n\n8π^5 ≈ 8 * 306.0196 ≈ 2448.1568\n\nk_B^4 = (1.38e-23)^4 ≈ 3.4e-92\n\nh^3 = (6.626e-34)^3 ≈ 2.91e-101\n\nc^3 = (3e8)^3 = 2.7e24\n\nSo numerator: 2448.1568 * 3.4e-92 ≈ 8.32e-89\n\nDenominator: 15 * 2.91e-101 * 2.7e24 ≈ 15 * 7.857e-77 ≈ 1.18e-75\n\nSo u = 8.32e-89 / 1.18e-75 * T^4 ≈ 7.05e-14 * T^4 J/m³/K^4\n\nTherefore, u = 7.05e-14 * T^4 J/m³\n\nFor T = 1e10 K, u = 7.05e-14 * (1e10)^4 = 7.05e-14 * 1e40 = 7.05e26 J/m³\n\nWait, this is even higher. Now I'm really confused. There's inconsistency between different methods. What's the correct value of the radiation constant a?\n\nWait, according to standard references, the radiation constant a is 4σ/c, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. σ is approximately 5.67e-8 W/m²/K⁴. So a = 4 * 5.67e-8 / 3e8 ≈ 7.56e-16 J/m³/K⁴, which matches the earlier value. Therefore, u = 7.56e-16 * T^4. For T=1e10 K, u=7.56e-16 * 1e40=7.56e24 J/m³. But when I computed using the formula with h and k_B, I got 7.05e26 J/m³. There's a discrepancy of two orders of magnitude. This suggests that I made a mistake in one of the calculations.\n\nLet me check the formula again. The correct expression for the energy density of black body radiation is:\n\nu = (8π^5 k_B^4)/(15 h^3 c^3) * T^4\n\nLet me compute this constant term step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 8π^5:\n\nπ ≈ 3.1416\n\nπ^2 ≈ 9.8696\n\nπ^3 ≈ 31.006\n\nπ^4 ≈ 97.409\n\nπ^5 ≈ 306.0196\n\nSo 8π^5 ≈ 8 * 306.0196 ≈ 2448.1568\n\nk_B^4 = (1.38e-23)^4. Let's compute this:\n\n1.38^4 ≈ 1.38*1.38=1.9044; 1.9044*1.38≈2.628; 2.628*1.38≈3.626. So approximately 3.626. Therefore, k_B^4 ≈ 3.626 * (1e-23)^4 = 3.626e-92\n\nh^3 = (6.626e-34)^3. Compute 6.626^3 ≈ 6.626*6.626=43.9, 43.9*6.626≈290.7. So h^3 ≈ 290.7e-102 = 2.907e-100 (wait, 6.626e-34 cubed is (6.626)^3 * 1e-102 ≈ 290 * 1e-102 = 2.9e-100)\n\nc^3 = (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25\n\nNow, denominator: 15 * h^3 * c^3 = 15 * 2.9e-100 * 2.7e25 = 15 * 7.83e-75 ≈ 1.1745e-73\n\nNumerator: 8π^5 k_B^4 ≈ 2448.1568 * 3.626e-92 ≈ 2448 * 3.626e-92 ≈ 8.87e-89\n\nSo u = 8.87e-89 / 1.1745e-73 = 7.55e-16 J/m³/K⁴ * T^4. Ah! So this matches the previous value of a = 7.56e-16 J/m³/K⁴. Therefore, the correct value is u = 7.56e-16 * T^4. So the earlier calculation using this formula was correct, giving u = 7.56e24 J/m³ for T=1e10 K. Then converting to mass density gives 8.4e7 kg/m³ = 8.4e4 g/cm³. So 84,000 g/cm³. But the options are 1 ton (1000 kg), 1g, etc. So 84,000 g/cm³ is 84 kg/cm³, which is 0.084 tons/cm³. Not matching any options. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem's options or my calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the temperature is 1e10 K, but in the formula, the energy density is per cubic meter, and the question asks per cubic centimeter. Wait, no, I already converted from kg/m³ to g/cm³ correctly. Let me check that again.\n\n8.4e7 kg/m³. Since 1 kg/m³ = 0.001 g/cm³ (because 1 kg = 1000 g, 1 m³ = 1e6 cm³, so 1 kg/m³ = 1000 g / 1e6 cm³ = 0.001 g/cm³). Therefore, 8.4e7 kg/m³ = 8.4e7 * 0.001 g/cm³ = 8.4e4 g/cm³. Correct. So 84,000 g/cm³. That's 84 kg/cm³. Which is 84,000 grams per cm³. But the options are 1 ton (10^6 grams), 1 gram, 1e-6 grams, 1e-16 grams. So 84,000 grams is 8.4e4 grams, which is not any of the options. Therefore, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the temperature is 1e10 K, but in the formula, I should use T in different units? No, the Stefan-Boltzmann law uses Kelvin. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the radiation's mass density at 1e10 K, but I made a mistake in the exponent when calculating (1e10)^4. Let me check that again.\n\n(1e10)^4 = 1e40. Correct. Then 7.56e-16 * 1e40 = 7.56e24 J/m³. Correct. Then dividing by c²: 7.56e24 / 9e16 = 8.4e7 kg/m³. Correct. Then converting to g/cm³: 8.4e7 kg/m³ = 8.4e7 * 1e3 g/m³ / 1e6 cm³/m³ = 8.4e10 g/m³ / 1e6 cm³/m³ = 8.4e4 g/cm³. Correct. So the calculation seems correct, but the answer isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is 1e-16 g/cm³, but how?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent when converting kg/m³ to g/cm³. Let me re-express the conversion:\n\n1 kg/m³ = 1000 g / 1,000,000 cm³ = 0.001 g/cm³ = 1e-3 g/cm³.\n\nTherefore, 8.4e7 kg/m³ = 8.4e7 * 1e-3 g/cm³ = 8.4e4 g/cm³. Correct. So 84,000 g/cm³. Which is 8.4e4 g/cm³. The options are 1 ton (1e6 grams), 1 gram, 1e-6 grams, 1e-16 grams. So none of these. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem or in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the radiation pressure instead of mass density? No, the question says \"weighs\", which implies mass. Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different relation between energy and mass. But E=mc² is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the temperature is 1e10 K, but in the formula, the energy density is different. Let me check with another approach. Let's compute the energy density using the average energy per photon times the number density of photons.\n\nThe number density of photons in black body radiation is given by n = (2.404 * 8π)/ ( (hc/(k_B T))^3 ) * (k_B T)^3 / ( (ħ c)^3 ) ). Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the energy density.\n\nAlternatively, the energy density of photons is u = (π²/15) (k_B T)^4 / ( (ħ c)^3 ). Let's compute this.\n\nk_B T = 1.38e-23 J/K * 1e10 K = 1.38e-13 J\n\n(ħ c)^3 = (1.05e-34 J s * 3e8 m/s)^3 = (3.15e-26 J m)^3 = 3.15e-26^3 = 3.15e-78 J^3 m^3\n\nSo u = (π²/15) * (1.38e-13 J)^4 / (3.15e-78 J^3 m^3)\n\nCompute numerator: (1.38e-13)^4 = 3.6e-52 J^4\n\nSo u = (9.8696/15) * 3.6e-52 / 3.15e-78 ≈ 0.658 * 3.6e-52 / 3.15e-78 ≈ 0.658 * 1.14e26 ≈ 0.75e26 J/m³ = 7.5e25 J/m³\n\nWait, this contradicts the previous value of 7.56e24 J/m³. There's a discrepancy of a factor of 10. Which one is correct?\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the value of the radiation constant a again. According to standard references, the radiation constant a is 7.56e-16 J/m³/K⁴. Therefore, at T=1e10 K, u=7.56e-16*(1e10)^4=7.56e24 J/m³. This should be correct. But when using the other formula, I get 7.5e25 J/m³. There's a factor of 10 difference. Where is this coming from?\n\nAh! Wait, the formula u = (8π^5 k_B^4)/(15 h^3 c^3) T^4. Let's compute this:\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J s\n\nh^3 = (6.626e-34)^3 ≈ 2.91e-101 J^3 s^3\n\nk_B^4 = (1.38e-23)^4 ≈ 3.4e-92 J^4/K^4\n\nNumerator: 8π^5 k_B^4 ≈ 8 * 306 * 3.4e-92 ≈ 8 * 1.04e-89 ≈ 8.32e-89\n\nDenominator: 15 h^3 c^3 ≈ 15 * 2.91e-101 * 2.7e24 ≈ 15 * 7.86e-77 ≈ 1.18e-75\n\nSo u = 8.32e-89 / 1.18e-75 ≈ 7.05e-14 T^4 J/m³/K^4\n\nTherefore, u = 7.05e-14 * (1e10)^4 = 7.05e-14 * 1e40 = 7.05e26 J/m³\n\nWait, this is different from the previous value of 7.56e24 J/m³. There's a discrepancy of 100 times. This suggests that there's a mistake in the calculation of the radiation constant a. But according to standard references, a = 4σ/c. Let's compute that:\n\nσ = 5.67e-8 W/m²/K⁴\n\na = 4σ/c = 4 * 5.67e-8 / 3e8 = 2.268e-7 / 3e8 = 7.56e-16 J/m³/K⁴. So this is correct. Therefore, using a = 7.56e-16 gives u = 7.56e24 J/m³ for T=1e10 K. But using the other formula gives 7.05e26 J/m³. This discrepancy must be due to a mistake in the other formula's calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent when calculating (k_B T). Let's recompute:\n\nk_B T = 1.38e-23 J/K * 1e10 K = 1.38e-13 J\n\n(k_B T)^4 = (1.38e-13)^4 = 1.38^4 * 1e-52 ≈ 3.6 * 1e-52 = 3.6e-52 J^4\n\nThen, the formula u = (π²/15) (k_B T)^4 / (ħ^3 c^3)\n\nħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s\n\nħ^3 = (1.0545718e-34)^3 ≈ 1.17e-102 J^3 s^3\n\nc^3 = (3e8)^3 = 2.7e24 m^3/s^3\n\nSo denominator: ħ^3 c^3 = 1.17e-102 * 2.7e24 = 3.16e-78 J^3 s^3 m^3/s^3 = 3.16e-78 J^3 m^3\n\nWait, the units here are J^3 m^3, but the numerator is J^4. So the units of u would be J^4 / (J^3 m^3) = J/m^3, which is correct. So numerically:\n\nu = (π²/15) * 3.6e-52 / 3.16e-78 ≈ (9.8696/15) * 3.6e-52 / 3.16e-78 ≈ 0.658 * 1.14e26 ≈ 7.5e25 J/m³\n\nBut according to the radiation constant a, it's 7.56e24 J/m³. There's a factor of 10 difference. This suggests that there's a mistake in one of the calculations. But which one is correct?\n\nLet me check with a reference value. For example, at T=300 K, what is the energy density?\n\nUsing a = 7.56e-16 J/m³/K⁴, u = 7.56e-16 * (300)^4 = 7.56e-16 * 8.1e10 = 6.12e-5 J/m³.

{"id": "atomic/4-16", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the minimum energy required for protons colliding with hydrogen to create antiprotons. Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic physics concepts here. \n\nFirst, when particles collide, the energy involved has to be sufficient to produce the desired particles. In this case, we're talking about creating antiprotons. Antiprotons have the same mass as protons but opposite charge. So, the key here is the conservation of energy and maybe some other conservation laws like baryon number. But let's focus on the energy part first.\n\nI remember that in particle collisions, the minimum energy required is related to the rest mass energy of the particles being created. But wait, since both the target and the projectile are protons (because hydrogen nuclei are just protons), we have a proton-proton collision. To create an antiproton, along with other particles to conserve baryon number, right? Because if you create an antiproton, you need to balance the baryon number. So, maybe the reaction would be something like p + p → p + p + p + anti-p. Let me check that.\n\nBaryon number conservation: each proton has a baryon number of +1. The antiproton has -1. So, if we start with two protons (total baryon number +2), the products must also have total +2. If we produce three protons and one antiproton, that's 3*(+1) + (-1) = +2. That works. So the reaction would need to produce at least three protons and one antiproton. Wait, but that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe producing other particles as well, but the key is that creating an antiproton requires creating additional baryons to balance the numbers. \n\nBut maybe the simplest way is to consider the threshold energy for producing an antiproton. The threshold energy is the minimum kinetic energy needed in the center-of-mass frame. However, since the question is about the lab frame where one proton is stationary (hydrogen target), and the other is accelerated, we need to calculate the minimum energy in the lab frame.\n\nI recall that the threshold condition occurs when all the produced particles are at rest in the center-of-mass frame. But how does that translate to the lab frame energy?\n\nThe formula for the minimum kinetic energy in the lab frame when a projectile hits a stationary target can be calculated using the invariant quantity s, the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame. The threshold condition is when the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is equal to the sum of the rest masses of the produced particles.\n\nSo, for the reaction p + p → p + p + p + anti-p, the total rest mass energy in the final state is 3m_p + m_anti-p. But since the antiproton has the same mass as the proton, that's 4m_p. Wait, but the initial state is two protons, so the rest mass energy is 2m_p. Therefore, the center-of-mass energy squared s must be at least (4m_p c²)². But wait, maybe I need to think again.\n\nWait, the reaction must conserve energy and momentum. The minimum energy occurs when all the products are at rest in the center-of-mass frame. Therefore, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products. So, for producing an antiproton, along with other particles to conserve baryon number, let's say we produce three protons and one antiproton. Then the total rest mass is 3m_p + m_p = 4m_p. So the center-of-mass energy must be at least 4m_p c². \n\nBut the initial energy in the center-of-mass frame comes from the two protons. The initial energy in the center-of-mass frame is sqrt(s) = sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2 ). Since the target proton is at rest, E2 = m_p c², and p2 = 0. The projectile proton has energy E1 = K + m_p c², where K is its kinetic energy. Its momentum p1 is sqrt( (E1/c²)^2 - m_p² c² ) / c. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a formula for the threshold energy in the lab frame.\n\nI remember that when a projectile hits a stationary target, the minimum kinetic energy required (threshold energy) to produce a certain mass M is given by K_min = [(M c²)^2 - (m1 + m2)^2 c^4]/(2 m2 c²), where m1 is the projectile mass and m2 is the target mass. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me check. Suppose we have two particles colliding: one with mass m1 (projectile) and energy E1, and the other with mass m2 (target) at rest. The threshold energy for producing a system with mass M is when the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is equal to M c². The invariant s is (E1 + m2 c²)^2 - (p1 c)^2 = (M c²)^2. Then, solving for E1:\n\n(E1 + m2 c²)^2 - (p1 c)^2 = (M c²)^2.\n\nBut p1 c = sqrt(E1^2 - m1² c^4). So substituting:\n\n(E1 + m2 c²)^2 - (E1^2 - m1² c^4) = M² c^4.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nE1² + 2 E1 m2 c² + m2² c^4 - E1² + m1² c^4 = M² c^4.\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 E1 m2 c² + (m1² + m2²) c^4 = M² c^4.\n\nThen solving for E1:\n\n2 E1 m2 c² = (M² - m1² - m2²) c^4.\n\nSo,\n\nE1 = [ (M² - m1² - m2²) c^4 ] / (2 m2 c² )\n\n= [ (M² - m1² - m2²) ] c² / (2 m2 )\n\nBut E1 is the total energy of the projectile, which is K + m1 c². Therefore,\n\nK + m1 c² = [ (M² - m1² - m2²) ] c² / (2 m2 )\n\nTherefore, the threshold kinetic energy K_min is:\n\nK_min = [ (M² - m1² - m2²) c² / (2 m2 ) ] - m1 c²\n\n= [ (M² - m1² - m2²) - 2 m1 m2 ] c² / (2 m2 )\n\n= [ M² - (m1 + m2)^2 ] c² / (2 m2 )\n\nSo, K_min = [ (M^2 - (m1 + m2)^2 ) / (2 m2) ] c²\n\nIn this problem, the projectile and target are both protons, so m1 = m2 = m_p. The mass M is the total rest mass of the products. Since we need to produce at least three protons and one antiproton (to conserve baryon number), the total rest mass M is 3m_p + m_p = 4m_p. Wait, but the antiproton has the same mass as the proton, so M = 4m_p.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The reaction must produce an antiproton, but you can't just produce an antiproton alone because of baryon number conservation. The initial baryon number is 2 (two protons). The final state must also have baryon number 2. An antiproton has baryon number -1, so if we have an antiproton, we need to have three protons to balance it: 3*(+1) + (-1) = +2. So, the products are three protons and one antiproton. Therefore, the total rest mass is 3m_p + m_p = 4m_p. So M = 4m_p.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nK_min = [ ( (4m_p)^2 - (m_p + m_p)^2 ) / (2 m_p) ] c²\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n(16 m_p² - 4 m_p²) = 12 m_p²\n\nSo,\n\nK_min = (12 m_p²) / (2 m_p) ) c² = 6 m_p c²\n\nBut wait, m_p c² is about 938 MeV, so 6 * 938 MeV ≈ 5.6 GeV. But the options given are 6.6 GeV, 3.3 GeV, 2 GeV. Hmm, 5.6 GeV isn't exactly one of the options. The closest is (a) 6.6 GeV. So maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the formula is K_min = [ (M^2 - (m1 + m2)^2 ) / (2 m2) ] c²\n\nHere, M is 4m_p, m1 = m2 = m_p.\n\nSo,\n\nM^2 = (4m_p)^2 = 16 m_p²\n\n(m1 + m2)^2 = (2m_p)^2 = 4 m_p²\n\nSo,\n\nM² - (m1 + m2)^2 = 16 m_p² - 4 m_p² = 12 m_p²\n\nThen,\n\nK_min = (12 m_p²) / (2 m_p) ) c² = (6 m_p) c²\n\nYes, that's 6 times the proton rest energy. Since m_p c² ≈ 938 MeV, 6 * 938 ≈ 5.628 GeV. But the answer isn't exactly 5.6, but the options are 6.6, 3.3, 2. So why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe the reaction isn't 3 protons and an antiproton. Maybe there's another way to conserve baryon number. Let me think. The initial baryon number is 2. The antiproton has -1. So, to get total +2, we need 3 protons (3*(+1)) and one antiproton (-1), totaling +2. So that's correct. So the total rest mass is 4m_p. Therefore, the calculation seems right. But the answer isn't matching the options. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is p + p → p + p + p + anti-p + pions or other mesons. But the threshold would still be when all the products are produced at rest in the center-of-mass frame, which would require the same energy. Wait, but pions have mass. If we include pions, the total rest mass would be higher. But the minimum energy would be when we produce the least possible additional mass. So the minimal case is when we produce only the necessary protons and antiproton without any additional particles. But in reality, you can't have a reaction with just those because of other conservation laws like charge. Let's check the charges.\n\nInitial charge: proton (charge +1) + proton (charge +1) = +2.\n\nFinal charge: three protons (+3) and one antiproton (-1). Total charge +2. So that's okay. So charge is conserved. So that reaction is possible. So the minimal energy should be 4m_p. But according to the calculation, the threshold energy in the lab frame is 6m_p c² ≈ 5.6 GeV. But the given option (a) is 6.6 GeV. Close but not exact. Maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let's check the formula again. The formula for the threshold energy when a projectile hits a stationary target is K_min = [(M^2 - (m1 + m2)^2)/(2 m2)] c². So in this case, M = 4m_p, m1 = m_p, m2 = m_p. So:\n\nK_min = [(16 m_p² - 4 m_p²)/(2 m_p)] c² = (12 m_p² / 2 m_p) c² = 6 m_p c². So 6 * 0.938 GeV ≈ 5.628 GeV. But the answer given is 6.6 GeV. Hmm. Maybe there's a mistake in assuming M = 4m_p. Maybe the reaction requires more particles?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct reaction is p + p → p + p + p + anti-p + p + p? No, that would be more. Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that creating an antiproton requires creating a proton-antiproton pair, but that would require more energy. Wait, no. If you create an antiproton, you need to create a proton to conserve baryon number. Wait, no. Wait, the baryon number for the initial state is 2. The final state must also have 2. If you create an antiproton (-1), you need to have three protons (+3) to get total +2. So, three protons and one antiproton. So total four particles. But maybe there's another way. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is p + p → p + p + p + anti-p + any number of pions (which are mesons and don't affect the baryon number). But the threshold would still be when the pions have zero energy, i.e., produced at rest, which would contribute to the rest mass. Wait, but pions have mass. So if you produce pions, the total rest mass would be higher, thus requiring higher energy. Therefore, the minimal energy is when no pions are produced, i.e., only the four baryons. Therefore, M = 4m_p. So the calculation should be correct. But the answer isn't matching the options. \n\nWait, maybe the question is considering that the target is a hydrogen atom, which includes an electron. But the mass of the electron is negligible compared to the proton, so that's probably not it. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is different. For example, maybe the antiproton is produced along with a proton-anti-proton pair, but that would complicate things. Wait, no. Let's think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is p + p → p + p + anti-p + X, where X is something that balances the baryon number. Wait, the initial baryon number is 2. The final state has two protons (from the initial) plus anti-p (-1) and X. So 2 + (-1) + X = 2 → X = 1. So X must be a baryon with +1. So maybe a neutron? But then you need to create a neutron as well. But neutrons are more massive than protons. Wait, but if X is a neutron, then the total rest mass would be 2m_p + m_anti-p + m_n. But that would be higher than 4m_p. So the threshold energy would be higher. But that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is p + p → p + p + p + anti-p + neutron? But that seems more complicated. I think the initial assumption of three protons and one antiproton is the minimal case.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is that when you collide two protons, you can't just produce three protons and an antiproton because of other conservation laws. For example, charge conservation. Let's check: initial charge is +2. The final charge would be three protons (+3) and one antiproton (-1), total +2. So that's okay. So charge is conserved. So that reaction is allowed. Therefore, the threshold should be 4m_p. But according to the calculation, the lab frame energy is 6m_p c² ≈ 5.6 GeV. But the options given are 6.6 GeV, 3.3 GeV, 2 GeV. None of these exactly match 5.6 GeV. The closest is 6.6 GeV, which is option (a). So why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe the actual calculation takes into account relativistic effects or uses a different formula. Let me check another approach. The threshold energy can also be calculated using the fact that in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy must be at least the sum of the rest masses. Then, the lab frame energy can be found by boosting from the center-of-mass frame.\n\nAlternatively, the minimum energy occurs when the produced particles are all at rest in the center-of-mass frame, which means that in the lab frame, after the collision, the particles must have some kinetic energy. But this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct formula is different. Let me recall another formula: when two particles collide, the minimum energy required in the lab frame (target at rest) is given by K_min = (2 m_p c²) * (number of particles produced). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the energy required is 2*(mass of proton)*c² times the number of particles, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that the production of a proton-antiproton pair requires at least 4 times the proton rest mass energy in the center-of-mass frame. But since one proton is stationary, the lab frame energy required is higher. The relation between the lab frame energy and the center-of-mass energy is such that the lab frame energy is much higher when the target is stationary.\n\nWait, the center-of-mass energy squared s = (E_lab + m_p c²)^2 - (p_lab c)^2. At threshold, s = (4 m_p c²)^2. So:\n\n(4 m_p c²)^2 = (E_lab + m_p c²)^2 - (p_lab c)^2\n\nBut E_lab is the total energy of the projectile proton, which is K + m_p c². The momentum p_lab is sqrt( (E_lab/c²)^2 - m_p² c² ) * c. So:\n\n(4 m_p c²)^2 = (K + m_p c² + m_p c²)^2 - [ sqrt( (K + m_p c²)^2 - m_p² c^4 ) * c ]^2\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= (K + 2 m_p c²)^2 - ( (K + m_p c²)^2 - m_p² c^4 )\n\nExpand both terms:\n\nFirst term: K² + 4 K m_p c² + 4 m_p² c^4\n\nSecond term: - (K² + 2 K m_p c² + m_p² c^4 - m_p² c^4 )\n\n= -K² - 2 K m_p c²\n\nSo combining:\n\nK² + 4 K m_p c² + 4 m_p² c^4 - K² - 2 K m_p c² = 2 K m_p c² + 4 m_p² c^4\n\nSet equal to left-hand side:\n\n16 m_p² c^4 = 2 K m_p c² + 4 m_p² c^4\n\nSubtract 4 m_p² c^4 from both sides:\n\n12 m_p² c^4 = 2 K m_p c²\n\nDivide both sides by 2 m_p c²:\n\n6 m_p c² = K\n\nSo K = 6 m_p c² ≈ 6 * 0.938 GeV ≈ 5.628 GeV. So approximately 5.6 GeV. But the options given are 6.6 GeV, 3.3 GeV, 2 GeV. None of these is 5.6. So this is confusing. Maybe the question is considering that the target is a hydrogen nucleus, which includes a proton and an electron. But the electron's mass is negligible, so that shouldn't affect much. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the collision is with a hydrogen atom, but the binding energy is negligible. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the correct answer is 6.6 GeV, which is option (a). But why is there a discrepancy? Let me check if I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's do the calculation again with precise numbers.\n\nThe rest mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c². So 6 times that is 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV = 5.628 GeV. But option (a) is 6.6 GeV. That's about 1 GeV higher. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the reaction requires more particles. For example, when creating an antiproton, you might need to create additional pions to conserve momentum or other quantum numbers. For example, the reaction p + p → p + p + p + anti-p + π. The pion has a rest mass of about 140 MeV. So the total rest mass would be 4m_p + m_π. Then, M = 4m_p + m_π. Let's see how much that affects the calculation.\n\nM = 4*938 + 140 ≈ 3752 + 140 = 3892 MeV ≈ 3.892 GeV/c².\n\nWait, but M is in units of GeV/c². Then, using the formula K_min = [ (M² - (2m_p)^2 ) / (2m_p) ] c².\n\nWait, M is 4m_p + m_π. So M = 4*0.938 + 0.14 ≈ 3.752 + 0.14 = 3.892 GeV/c².\n\nThen,\n\nM² = (3.892)^2 ≈ 15.15 (GeV/c²)^2\n\n(2m_p)^2 = (1.876)^2 ≈ 3.52 (GeV/c²)^2\n\nSo,\n\nM² - (2m_p)^2 ≈ 15.15 - 3.52 = 11.63 (GeV/c²)^2\n\nThen,\n\nK_min = 11.63 / (2 * 0.938) GeV ≈ 11.63 / 1.876 ≈ 6.2 GeV. Still not 6.6 GeV. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiple pions are required. For example, two pions. Then M = 4m_p + 2m_π ≈ 4*0.938 + 2*0.14 ≈ 3.752 + 0.28 = 4.032 GeV/c².\n\nThen,\n\nM² ≈ (4.032)^2 ≈ 16.26 (GeV/c²)^2\n\n(2m_p)^2 ≈ 3.52\n\nM² - (2m_p)^2 ≈ 16.26 - 3.52 = 12.74\n\nK_min = 12.74 / (2 * 0.938) ≈ 12.74 / 1.876 ≈ 6.79 GeV. Closer to 6.6 GeV. But still not exact. And this is assuming two pions are produced. But why would you need to produce pions? The original reaction without pions conserves charge and baryon number. So maybe the pions are not necessary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the antiproton must be produced in pairs. Wait, no. Antiprotons can be produced singly as long as the baryon number is conserved. For example, in the reaction we considered earlier, three protons and one antiproton give a total baryon number of +2, which matches the initial state. So that's allowed.\n\nBut then why is the calculated value around 5.6 GeV, but the closest option is 6.6 GeV? Maybe the question is using a different approach. Let me think differently. \n\nAnother way to think about this is that creating an antiproton requires at least twice the proton's rest energy in the center-of-mass frame. But since one proton is stationary, the lab frame energy required is higher. The formula for converting between lab frame and center-of-mass frame energy might be necessary.\n\nWait, the center-of-mass energy squared s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2. Since the target is at rest, E2 = m_p c², p2 = 0. The projectile has energy E1 = K + m_p c², and momentum p1 = sqrt(E1²/c² - m_p² c²). So,\n\ns = (K + m_p c² + m_p c²)^2 - (sqrt( (K + m_p c²)^2/c² - m_p² c² ) * c )^2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (K + 2 m_p c²)^2 - ( (K + m_p c²)^2 - m_p² c^4 )\n\nExpand:\n\n= K² + 4 K m_p c² + 4 m_p² c^4 - K² - 2 K m_p c² - m_p² c^4 + m_p² c^4\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 2 K m_p c² + 4 m_p² c^4\n\nAt threshold, s = (4 m_p c²)^2 = 16 m_p² c^4\n\nSo,\n\n2 K m_p c² + 4 m_p² c^4 = 16 m_p² c^4\n\nSubtract 4 m_p² c^4:\n\n2 K m_p c² = 12 m_p² c^4\n\nDivide both sides by 2 m_p c²:\n\nK = 6 m_p c²\n\nWhich is the same result as before. So the calculation is correct. Therefore, the minimum kinetic energy should be 6 times the proton rest energy, which is approximately 5.6 GeV. But the options don't include this. The closest is 6.6 GeV. Maybe the question assumes a different reaction or there's a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the total energy, not the kinetic energy. The total energy of the projectile is K + m_p c². So 5.6 GeV + 0.938 GeV ≈ 6.54 GeV, which is approximately 6.6 GeV. Ah! That must be it. The question might be asking for the total energy of the proton, not just the kinetic energy. Let me check the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"What is the minimum energy to create antiprotons?\" The term \"energy\" here could be interpreted as the total energy of the incoming proton, not just its kinetic energy. If that's the case, then the total energy E = K + m_p c² = 6 m_p c² + m_p c² = 7 m_p c²? Wait, no. Wait, earlier calculation gives K = 6 m_p c². So total energy E = K + m_p c² = 7 m_p c² ≈ 6.6 GeV (since 7 * 0.938 ≈ 6.566 GeV). Ah! So 7 times the proton rest energy is approximately 6.6 GeV. Therefore, the answer would be (a) 6.6 GeV.\n\nBut why is this the case? The confusion arises between kinetic energy and total energy. The formula we derived earlier gives the kinetic energy K_min = 6 m_p c² ≈ 5.6 GeV, but if the question is asking for the total energy (which is kinetic plus rest energy), then it's 6 m_p c² + m_p c² = 7 m_p c² ≈ 6.6 GeV. Therefore, the correct answer is (a) 6.6 GeV.\n\nThis must be the case. The question asks for the minimum energy, which is often interpreted as the total energy required. However, in physics, when asking about the \"minimum energy to create\" something, it's usually the center-of-mass energy that needs to be sufficient. But since the question is in the lab frame, and the options include 6.6 GeV, which is approximately 7 times the proton rest energy, this suggests that the total energy (kinetic + rest) is being considered. Therefore, the answer is (a) 6.6 GeV.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the minimum energy required for protons colliding with hydrogen to create antiprotons, we consider the conservation laws and threshold energy conditions. The reaction must conserve baryon number and charge. The threshold occurs when the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame equals the rest mass of the produced particles. For the reaction \\( p + p \\rightarrow p + p + p + \\bar{p} \\), the total rest mass in the final state is \\( 4m_p \\).\n\nThe threshold energy in the lab frame (where one proton is stationary) is calculated using the invariant \\( s \\), which relates the total energy and momentum. The minimum kinetic energy \\( K_{\\text{min}} \\) of the projectile proton is derived as:\n\n\\[\nK_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{(M^2 - (m_1 + m_2)^2)c^2}{2m_2}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( M = 4m_p \\), \\( m_1 = m_2 = m_p \\). Substituting these values:\n\n\\[\nK_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{(16m_p^2 - 4m_p^2)c^2}{2m_p} = 6m_pc^2\n\\]\n\nThe proton rest energy \\( m_pc^2 \\approx 0.938 \\, \\text{GeV} \\), so:\n\n\\[\nK_{\\text{min}} \\approx 6 \\times 0.938 \\, \\text{GeV} \\approx 5.6 \\, \\text{GeV}\n\\]\n\nHowever, the question likely asks for the **total energy** (kinetic + rest energy) of the projectile proton. Adding the rest energy \\( m_pc^2 \\):\n\n\\[\nE_{\\text{total}} = K_{\\text{min}} + m_pc^2 = 7m_pc^2 \\approx 6.6 \\, \\text{GeV}\n\\]\n\nThus, the minimum total energy required is **6.6 GeV**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{a}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["a"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "a", "expr2": "6.6 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/4-20", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the free energy available to produce mass when a 1000 GeV proton collides with a resting proton. Hmm, I remember that in particle collisions, the available energy (or the center-of-mass energy) is what's important for producing new particles. The problem is asking for the free energy, which I think refers to the center-of-mass energy here.\n\nFirst, let me recall the formula for the center-of-mass energy. The total energy in the center-of-mass frame (sqrt(s)) is given by the square root of the invariant mass squared. The formula should involve the energies and momenta of the two particles. But since one proton is at rest, maybe there's a simpler way to compute it.\n\nWait, when one particle is moving and the other is at rest, the total energy is the sum of their energies. The moving proton has energy E1 = 1000 GeV, and the resting proton has energy E2 = m_p c². But since we're dealing in GeV and protons have a rest mass of about 0.938 GeV, but maybe the problem is using natural units where c=1, so the rest energy is just m_p = 0.938 GeV. But maybe the problem is simplified and we can take the rest mass as negligible compared to 1000 GeV? Wait, but the answer options are 41.3, 1000, 500. 41.3 is close to sqrt(2 * E_lab * m_p), maybe?\n\nWait, the formula for the center-of-mass energy when one particle is at rest. Let me think. The center-of-mass energy squared s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since the second proton is at rest, p2 = 0. So s = (E1 + m_p c²)^2 - (p1 c)^2. But E1 is the total energy of the moving proton, which is gamma m_p c², and p1 is gamma m_p v. But maybe in natural units where c=1, so E1 = gamma m_p, and p1 = gamma m_p v. But maybe there's a better way to express this.\n\nAlternatively, using the invariant s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total)^2. Since one proton is at rest, the total energy E_total is E_lab + m_p (since E2 = m_p when at rest). The total momentum p_total is just the momentum of the moving proton, p_lab. So s = (E_lab + m_p)^2 - (p_lab)^2. But E_lab for the moving proton is 1000 GeV. But we need to relate E_lab and p_lab. For a relativistic particle, E^2 = p^2 + m_p^2. So p_lab = sqrt(E_lab^2 - m_p^2). Since E_lab is 1000 GeV, which is much larger than m_p (~1 GeV), so p_lab ≈ E_lab. So approximately, s ≈ (1000 + 1)^2 - (1000)^2 = (1001)^2 - 1000^2 = (1001 - 1000)(1001 + 1000) = 1 * 2001 = 2001. So sqrt(s) ≈ sqrt(2001) ≈ 44.7 GeV. But the answer given is 41.3 GeV. Hmm, maybe the approximation isn't good enough. Let's do the exact calculation.\n\nWait, let's compute s exactly. E_lab = 1000 GeV, m_p = 0.938 GeV (approximate rest mass). Then p_lab = sqrt(E_lab^2 - m_p^2) = sqrt(1000^2 - 0.938^2) ≈ sqrt(1000000 - ~0.88) ≈ 1000 GeV. So s = (E_lab + m_p)^2 - p_lab^2. Plugging in the numbers:\n\ns = (1000 + 0.938)^2 - (sqrt(1000^2 - 0.938^2))^2\n\nSimplify the second term: (sqrt(1000^2 - 0.938^2))^2 = 1000^2 - 0.938^2\n\nSo s = (1000 + 0.938)^2 - (1000^2 - 0.938^2)\n\nExpanding the first square: 1000^2 + 2*1000*0.938 + 0.938^2\n\nSo s = 1000^2 + 2*1000*0.938 + 0.938^2 - 1000^2 + 0.938^2\n\nSimplify: 2*1000*0.938 + 2*0.938^2\n\nFactor out 2*0.938: 2*0.938*(1000 + 0.938)\n\nCalculate 1000 + 0.938 ≈ 1000.938\n\nSo s ≈ 2*0.938*1000.938 ≈ 1.876 * 1000.938 ≈ 1.876*1000 + 1.876*0.938 ≈ 1876 + ~1.76 ≈ 1877.76\n\nThen sqrt(s) ≈ sqrt(1877.76) ≈ sqrt(1877.76). Let's compute that. 43^2 = 1849, 44^2=1936. So between 43 and 44. Let's see: 43.3^2 = 43^2 + 2*43*0.3 + 0.3^2 = 1849 + 25.8 + 0.09 = 1874.89. 43.3^2 ≈ 1874.89. Our s is 1877.76, so 43.3^2 = 1874.89, 43.4^2 = 43.3^2 + 2*43.3*0.1 + 0.1^2 = 1874.89 + 8.66 + 0.01 = 1883.56. So 1877.76 is between 43.3 and 43.4. Let's do linear approximation. The difference between 1877.76 and 1874.89 is 2.87. The interval between 43.3 and 43.4 is 0.1 in x, which corresponds to 1883.56 - 1874.89 = 8.67 in y. So 2.87 /8.67 ≈ 0.331. So sqrt(s) ≈ 43.3 + 0.331*0.1 ≈ 43.3 + 0.0331 ≈ 43.333 GeV. But the answer given is 41.3 GeV. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let's check again. The exact formula for the center-of-mass energy when one particle is at rest is sqrt(2 m_p c^2 * E_lab + 2 m_p^2 c^4). Wait, maybe there's a different approach. Let me recall that when a particle of energy E collides with a stationary target of mass m, the available center-of-mass energy is sqrt(2 m E + (m + m)^2). Wait, perhaps not. Let me look up the formula again mentally.\n\nThe correct formula for the center-of-mass energy when a projectile with energy E (kinetic energy?) hits a target at rest. Wait, but in high-energy physics, E is often the total energy. Wait, the total energy of the projectile is E1 = gamma m_p c², and the target is at rest, so E2 = m_p c². Then the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is sqrt(2 m_p c² (E1 + m_p c²)). Wait, no. Let me derive it properly.\n\nThe invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since the target is at rest, p2 = 0. So s = (E1 + m_p c²)^2 - (p1 c)^2. But E1^2 = (p1 c)^2 + (m_p c²)^2. So substitute (p1 c)^2 = E1^2 - (m_p c²)^2 into s:\n\ns = (E1 + m_p c²)^2 - (E1^2 - (m_p c²)^2) = E1^2 + 2 E1 m_p c² + (m_p c²)^2 - E1^2 + (m_p c²)^2 = 2 E1 m_p c² + 2 (m_p c²)^2 = 2 m_p c² (E1 + m_p c²)\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, expanding (E1 + m_p c²)^2 = E1² + 2 E1 m_p c² + (m_p c²)^2. Then subtract (p1 c)^2 = E1² - (m_p c²)^2. So s = E1² + 2 E1 m_p c² + (m_p c²)^2 - E1² + (m_p c²)^2 = 2 E1 m_p c² + 2 (m_p c²)^2. So s = 2 m_p c² (E1 + m_p c²). Therefore, sqrt(s) = sqrt(2 m_p c² (E1 + m_p c²)).\n\nBut in natural units where c=1, and m_p is in GeV/c², then m_p c² is m_p GeV. So sqrt(s) = sqrt(2 m_p (E1 + m_p )). Wait, but E1 here is the total energy of the projectile. If the problem states that the proton has 1000 GeV of kinetic energy, then E1 = K + m_p. But the problem says \"a 1000 GeV proton\", which usually refers to the kinetic energy, but sometimes in high-energy physics, they refer to the total energy. Wait, this is a possible source of confusion.\n\nWait, the problem says \"a 1000 GeV proton hits a resting proton\". So if the proton is moving with energy 1000 GeV, is that kinetic energy or total energy? In particle physics, when they say a proton has an energy of X GeV, it's usually the total energy (including rest mass). But sometimes, especially in older terminology, they might refer to kinetic energy. However, given that the rest mass of a proton is about 0.938 GeV, if the kinetic energy is 1000 GeV, then the total energy would be approximately 1000.938 GeV, which is almost 1000 GeV. But if the problem states the proton's energy is 1000 GeV, then we can take E1 = 1000 GeV (total energy), and m_p = 0.938 GeV.\n\nSo using the formula sqrt(s) = sqrt(2 m_p (E1 + m_p )). Wait, no, the formula we derived earlier was sqrt(s) = sqrt(2 m_p c² (E1 + m_p c²)) / c²? Wait, no, in natural units where c=1, the formula is sqrt(s) = sqrt(2 m_p (E1 + m_p )). Wait, no, let's redo the calculation with natural units (c=1, ħ=1).\n\nIn natural units, the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 + p2)^2. Since the target is at rest, p2 = 0, so s = (E1 + m_p)^2 - (p1)^2. But E1^2 = p1^2 + m_p^2, so p1^2 = E1^2 - m_p^2. Therefore, s = (E1 + m_p)^2 - (E1^2 - m_p^2) = E1^2 + 2 E1 m_p + m_p^2 - E1^2 + m_p^2 = 2 E1 m_p + 2 m_p^2 = 2 m_p (E1 + m_p). Therefore, sqrt(s) = sqrt(2 m_p (E1 + m_p)).\n\nBut if E1 is much larger than m_p (which it is here, 1000 GeV vs ~1 GeV), then sqrt(s) ≈ sqrt(2 m_p E1). So in this case, sqrt(2 * 0.938 GeV * 1000 GeV) = sqrt(2 * 938) GeV. Let's compute that. 2*938 = 1876. sqrt(1876) ≈ 43.3 GeV. But the answer given is 41.3 GeV. Hmm, discrepancy here. Wait, maybe the problem states that the proton's kinetic energy is 1000 GeV, not the total energy. Let's check that possibility.\n\nIf the proton's kinetic energy K = 1000 GeV, then its total energy E1 = K + m_p = 1000 + 0.938 ≈ 1000.938 GeV. Then sqrt(s) = sqrt(2 m_p (E1 + m_p)) = sqrt(2 * 0.938 * (1000.938 + 0.938)) ≈ sqrt(2 * 0.938 * 1001.876) ≈ sqrt(2 * 0.938 * 1001.876). Let's compute 0.938 * 1001.876 ≈ 0.938 * 1000 + 0.938 * 1.876 ≈ 938 + 1.76 ≈ 939.76. Then multiply by 2: 2 * 939.76 ≈ 1879.52. sqrt(1879.52) ≈ 43.35 GeV. Still around 43 GeV, not 41.3. So why is the answer 41.3?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check again. The correct formula for the center-of-mass energy when a particle of total energy E collides with a stationary target of mass m is sqrt(2 m E + 2 m^2). Wait, but in natural units, s = (E1 + m_p)^2 - p1^2. But p1^2 = E1^2 - m_p^2. So s = (E1 + m_p)^2 - (E1^2 - m_p^2) = E1^2 + 2 E1 m_p + m_p^2 - E1^2 + m_p^2 = 2 E1 m_p + 2 m_p^2. So sqrt(s) = sqrt(2 m_p (E1 + m_p)). If E1 is much larger than m_p, then sqrt(s) ≈ sqrt(2 m_p E1). So if E1 is 1000 GeV, then sqrt(s) ≈ sqrt(2 * 0.938 * 1000) ≈ sqrt(1876) ≈ 43.3 GeV. But the answer is 41.3. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is using the kinetic energy of the incoming proton, not the total energy. Let's suppose that the 1000 GeV is the kinetic energy. Then the total energy E1 = K + m_p = 1000 + 0.938 ≈ 1000.938 GeV. Then sqrt(s) = sqrt(2 * 0.938 * (1000.938 + 0.938)) ≈ sqrt(2 * 0.938 * 1001.876) ≈ sqrt(2 * 0.938 * 1001.876). Let's compute 0.938 * 1001.876 ≈ 0.938 * 1000 + 0.938 * 1.876 ≈ 938 + 1.76 ≈ 939.76. Multiply by 2: 2 * 939.76 ≈ 1879.52. sqrt(1879.52) ≈ 43.35 GeV. Still not 41.3. So why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is using non-relativistic formulas? But that doesn't make sense for such high energies. Alternatively, maybe the rest mass of the proton is considered to be 1 GeV for simplicity? If m_p = 1 GeV, then sqrt(2 * 1 * 1000) = sqrt(2000) ≈ 44.7 GeV. Still not 41.3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the formula for the available energy in the case of two particles colliding, but with one at rest. Wait, another approach: the maximum energy available for mass production is the center-of-mass energy minus the rest masses of the initial particles. But in this case, the initial rest masses are two protons, so the available energy would be sqrt(s) - 2 m_p. But the problem says \"free energy to produce mass\", which might mean the total energy available in the center-of-mass frame, which is sqrt(s). Because in that frame, all the energy can go into mass. So if the answer is 41.3 GeV, but our calculation gives ~43 GeV, there's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is using a different approach. Let me check the formula again. Another way to write the center-of-mass energy is:\n\nsqrt(s) = sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 )\n\nSince the target is at rest, E2 = m_p c², p2 = 0. So sqrt(s) = sqrt( (E1 + m_p c²)^2 - (p1 c)^2 )\n\nBut E1 is the total energy of the moving proton, which is related to its momentum by E1² = (p1 c)^2 + (m_p c²)^2. Therefore, (p1 c)^2 = E1² - (m_p c²)^2. Substitute back into sqrt(s):\n\nsqrt(s) = sqrt( (E1 + m_p c²)^2 - (E1² - (m_p c²)^2) )\n\nExpanding the square:\n\n= sqrt( E1² + 2 E1 m_p c² + (m_p c²)^2 - E1² + (m_p c²)^2 )\n\n= sqrt( 2 E1 m_p c² + 2 (m_p c²)^2 )\n\nFactor out 2 m_p c²:\n\n= sqrt( 2 m_p c² (E1 + m_p c²) )\n\nIf we take c=1 (natural units), then:\n\nsqrt(s) = sqrt( 2 m_p (E1 + m_p) )\n\nBut if E1 is given as 1000 GeV, and m_p is 0.938 GeV, then:\n\nsqrt(s) = sqrt( 2 * 0.938 * (1000 + 0.938) ) ≈ sqrt( 2 * 0.938 * 1000.938 )\n\nCalculate 0.938 * 1000.938 ≈ 938.88 GeV²\n\nMultiply by 2: 1877.76 GeV²\n\nTake square root: sqrt(1877.76) ≈ 43.33 GeV\n\nBut the answer given is 41.3 GeV. There's a discrepancy here. Maybe the problem is using a different rest mass for the proton? For example, if m_p = 1 GeV, then sqrt(2 * 1 * 1001) ≈ sqrt(2002) ≈ 44.74 GeV. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the collision in the lab frame and asking for the available energy, which might be different. Wait, no, the available energy for producing mass is the center-of-mass energy. Unless the question is asking for something else, like the energy available in a fixed-target experiment compared to a collider. For example, in fixed-target, the available energy scales with sqrt(E_lab), whereas in a collider, it scales linearly with E. But the answer options don't include that.\n\nWait, let's check the options again. The options are (a) 41.3 GeV, (b) 1000 GeV, (c) 500 GeV. Our calculation gives around 43 GeV, which is close to option (a) 41.3 GeV. Maybe the exact value is 41.3 GeV if we use precise values. Let me check with more precise numbers.\n\nProton rest mass: m_p = 938.272 MeV/c² ≈ 0.938272 GeV/c².\n\nGiven E1 = 1000 GeV (total energy), then:\n\nsqrt(s) = sqrt(2 * m_p * (E1 + m_p)) = sqrt(2 * 0.938272 * (1000 + 0.938272)).\n\nCalculate inside the sqrt:\n\n0.938272 * 1000.938272 ≈ 0.938272 * 1000 + 0.938272 * 0.938272 ≈ 938.272 + 0.880 ≈ 939.152 GeV²\n\nMultiply by 2: 2 * 939.152 ≈ 1878.304 GeV²\n\nsqrt(1878.304) ≈ 43.34 GeV. Still not 41.3. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is using the kinetic energy of the incoming proton as 1000 GeV. Let's try that. If the kinetic energy K = 1000 GeV, then the total energy E1 = K + m_p = 1000 + 0.938272 ≈ 1000.938272 GeV.\n\nThen sqrt(s) = sqrt(2 * m_p * (E1 + m_p)) = sqrt(2 * 0.938272 * (1000.938272 + 0.938272)) = sqrt(2 * 0.938272 * 1001.876544)\n\nCalculate 0.938272 * 1001.876544 ≈ 0.938272 * 1000 + 0.938272 * 1.876544 ≈ 938.272 + 1.762 ≈ 940.034 GeV²\n\nMultiply by 2: 2 * 940.034 ≈ 1880.068 GeV²\n\nsqrt(1880.068) ≈ 43.36 GeV. Still around 43.3 GeV.\n\nBut the answer given is 41.3 GeV. There's a discrepancy here. Maybe the problem is using a non-relativistic approximation? But that doesn't make sense for such high energies. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the threshold energy for producing a certain mass, but the question says \"free energy to produce mass\", which should be the total available energy in the center-of-mass frame.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a different formula. Let me think. Another approach: the available energy in the center-of-mass frame is given by:\n\nE_cm = sqrt(2 m_p c^2 (E_lab + m_p c^2))\n\nBut if E_lab is the kinetic energy, then E_lab = (gamma - 1) m_p c^2. But this complicates things. Wait, perhaps the problem is using the approximation where the kinetic energy is much larger than the rest mass, so E_lab ≈ K ≈ gamma m_p c^2. But even then, the formula would still give sqrt(2 m_p K). Let's see: if K = 1000 GeV, then sqrt(2 * 0.938 * 1000) ≈ sqrt(1876) ≈ 43.3 GeV. Still not 41.3.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is using the lab frame energy, but the available energy is less because some energy goes into kinetic energy of the products. But no, the center-of-mass energy is the maximum available for mass production. All the energy in the center-of-mass frame can, in principle, go into mass. So the answer should be sqrt(s), which we calculated as ~43 GeV. But the given answer is 41.3 GeV. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's options, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check another source. For a collision between a moving proton and a stationary proton, the center-of-mass energy is given by sqrt(2 m_p E_lab (1 + E_lab/(2 m_p c^2))). Wait, but that formula might be for non-relativistic cases. Alternatively, when E_lab is the kinetic energy. Let me check.\n\nIf the incoming proton has kinetic energy K, then its total energy is E = K + m_p c². Then the center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E + m_p c²)^2 - (p c)^2. As before, p c = sqrt(E² - (m_p c²)^2). So s = (K + 2 m_p c²)^2 - (K^2 + 2 K m_p c²). Wait, expanding (K + 2 m_p c²)^2 = K² + 4 K m_p c² + 4 (m_p c²)^2. Subtract (p c)^2 = K² + 2 K m_p c². So s = K² +4 K m_p c² +4 m_p² c^4 - K² -2 K m_p c² = 2 K m_p c² +4 m_p² c^4. Therefore, sqrt(s) = sqrt(2 K m_p c² +4 m_p² c^4) = sqrt(2 m_p c² (K + 2 m_p c²)). If K is much larger than m_p c², then sqrt(s) ≈ sqrt(2 m_p c² K). But if K is 1000 GeV, then sqrt(s) ≈ sqrt(2 * 0.938 * 1000) ≈ 43.3 GeV. Again, same result.\n\nBut the answer given is 41.3 GeV. I'm confused. Maybe the problem has a typo, or I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the available energy after subtracting the rest mass of the two protons. But that would be sqrt(s) - 2 m_p ≈ 43.3 - 1.876 ≈ 41.4 GeV. Ah! That's very close to 41.3 GeV. So maybe the question is asking for the available energy to produce new mass, excluding the rest mass of the original protons. Let's check that.\n\nIf the total center-of-mass energy is sqrt(s) ≈ 43.3 GeV, and the rest mass of the two protons is 2 * 0.938 ≈ 1.876 GeV, then the available energy for producing new mass would be 43.3 - 1.876 ≈ 41.4 GeV, which rounds to 41.4 GeV. The answer given is 41.3 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the question is asking for the available energy excluding the rest mass of the initial protons. That would make sense, because the initial rest mass energy isn't available to create new particles; it's just the existing mass.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be (a) 41.3 GeV. So the process is: calculate the center-of-mass energy sqrt(s) ≈ 43.3 GeV, subtract the rest mass of the two protons (1.876 GeV) to get approximately 41.4 GeV, which is close to 41.3 GeV. Therefore, option (a) is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the free energy available to produce mass when a 1000 GeV proton collides with a resting proton, we calculate the center-of-mass energy (CM energy) and subtract the rest energy of the initial protons. \n\n1. **CM Energy Formula**:  \n   The invariant CM energy squared is:  \n   \\[\n   s = (E_1 + E_2)^2 - (\\vec{p}_1c + \\vec{p}_2c)^2\n   \\]  \n   For a stationary target (\\(E_2 = m_p c^2\\), \\(\\vec{p}_2 = 0\\)) and a moving proton with total energy \\(E_1 = 1000 \\, \\text{GeV}\\), the CM energy becomes:  \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{s} = \\sqrt{2 m_p c^2 (E_1 + m_p c^2)}\n   \\]  \n   Using natural units (\\(c = 1\\)) and \\(m_p \\approx 0.938 \\, \\text{GeV}\\):  \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{s} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 0.938 \\cdot (1000 + 0.938)} \\approx \\sqrt{1878.3} \\approx 43.3 \\, \\text{GeV}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Available Energy for Mass Production**:  \n   The total CM energy includes the rest energy of the two protons (\\(2m_p \\approx 1.876 \\, \\text{GeV}\\)).

{"id": "atomic/3-6", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to determine for each conservation law or symmetry (a) to (d) which interactions (Strong, Electromagnetic, Weak) do not violate them. Then, for one of these, provide an experiment that showed a violation. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the conservation laws and their relation to the fundamental interactions. Let's go through each part one by one.\n\nStarting with (a) I-spin conservation. I-spin, or isospin, is a symmetry related to the strong interaction. The idea is that protons and neutrons can be treated as two states of the same particle under isospin symmetry. The strong interaction conserves isospin, but the electromagnetic and weak interactions do not. Wait, but wait—electromagnetic interactions definitely break isospin because they depend on charge, which differentiates between protons and neutrons. The weak interaction also doesn't conserve isospin. So for (a), only the strong interaction conserves I-spin. Therefore, the answer for (a) would be S (strong), and E and W do violate it.\n\nMoving to (b) I3 conservation. I3 is the third component of isospin. For the strong interaction, isospin is conserved, so I3 should be conserved as well. But electromagnetic interactions break isospin symmetry. Since the electromagnetic force depends on electric charge, which is related to I3 (for example, proton has I3=+1/2, neutron -1/2), the EM interaction would not conserve I3. Wait, but wait—maybe in EM interactions, even though isospin isn't conserved, maybe I3 is conserved? Hmm. Wait, in the strong interaction, both I and I3 are conserved. In EM interactions, the symmetry is broken because the electromagnetic charge is related to I3 and hypercharge. So EM interactions do not conserve I-spin, but maybe they conserve I3? Wait, no. The electromagnetic interaction Hamiltonian includes a term proportional to electric charge, which is a combination of I3 and hypercharge (like in the Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula Q = I3 + Y/2). Therefore, the EM interaction breaks I-spin symmetry but may conserve I3 in some cases? Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. For example, in processes mediated by the electromagnetic force, like photon interactions, the charge is conserved, but I3 might not be. For instance, consider a process where a particle with certain I3 decays electromagnetically. Since the EM interaction doesn't respect the full isospin symmetry, I3 might not be conserved. Wait, but maybe in EM interactions, I3 is not conserved. For example, the decay of the pion: charged pions decay via the weak interaction, but wait, neutral pion decays electromagnetically to photons. The neutral pion has I3=0, and the photon has I3=0. So maybe in that case, I3 is conserved. But maybe in other EM processes, I3 isn't conserved. Alternatively, perhaps the EM interaction conserves I3 but not the full isospin. Wait, the photon is part of the SU(2) symmetry? No, the photon is a mixture of SU(2) and U(1) fields. Hmm. Maybe I should check. The electromagnetic interaction is a U(1) symmetry, which corresponds to charge conservation. Since charge is related to I3 and hypercharge, the EM interaction would break I-spin (SU(2)) symmetry but conserve charge. However, I3 itself is not conserved in EM interactions. For example, consider a particle with I3=1 decaying via EM. If the decay products have different I3, then I3 isn't conserved. But charge is conserved. Wait, but charge is Q = I3 + Y/2. So if Y is conserved in EM interactions, then maybe I3 is not. Wait, hypercharge Y is part of the electroweak symmetry. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me recall: in the Standard Model, the electromagnetic interaction is a combination of the SU(2)_L and U(1)_Y symmetries. The charge is Q = T3 + Y/2. So, in electromagnetic interactions, the symmetry is U(1)_Q, which is a combination of T3 and Y. Therefore, the EM interaction does not conserve T3 (I3) because it's part of a larger symmetry. So, for example, in electromagnetic processes, T3 can change as long as Q is conserved. Therefore, I3 is not conserved in EM interactions. Therefore, only the strong interaction conserves I3. So for (b), the answer would be S (strong), and E and W violate it. Wait, but wait—the weak interaction definitely doesn't conserve I3. So for (b), only strong interactions conserve I3. So (a) and (b) both are conserved only in strong interactions. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up isospin and weak isospin. Wait, I-spin is the strong isospin. The weak interaction has its own SU(2) symmetry (weak isospin), which is different. So the weak interaction doesn't conserve strong isospin or I3. Therefore, for (a) and (b), only the strong interaction conserves them. So (a) and (b) both have S as the only interaction that doesn't violate the symmetry. But wait, let me check for (b) I3 conservation. For example, in beta decay (weak interaction), a neutron (I3=-1/2) decays into a proton (I3=+1/2), electron, and antineutrino. So I3 changes from -1/2 to +1/2 in the nucleon part, which is a change in I3. Therefore, weak interactions violate I3 conservation. Electromagnetic interactions: suppose a process like the decay of a rho meson (which is a vector meson with isospin I=1). If it decays electromagnetically, does it conserve I3? The rho+ (I3=+1) could decay into pi+ and pi0, but that's strong decay. Alternatively, maybe a sigma particle decaying electromagnetically. Hmm, perhaps a better example: the decay of the Delta++ baryon (which has I3=3/2) via electromagnetic interaction. If it decays into a proton (I3=1/2) and a pion+ (I3=+1), then total I3 would be 1/2 +1 = 3/2, so I3 is conserved. Wait, but the Delta++ is a strong decay usually, but if it were to decay electromagnetically, maybe. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, consider the electromagnetic decay of the neutral pion to two photons. The pion has I3=0, and photons have I3=0. So I3 is conserved here. But maybe in other EM processes, I3 isn't conserved. For example, if a particle with I3=1 decays into two particles with I3=0 and 1, but charge conservation might require that. Wait, perhaps in EM interactions, I3 is not conserved. For example, consider the decay of a charged pion (I3=+1) via electromagnetic interaction. But charged pions actually decay via the weak interaction (to muon and neutrino), so that's not EM. The neutral pion decays electromagnetically to two photons. So in that case, I3 is conserved. Hmm. Maybe in EM interactions, I3 is conserved? But that seems conflicting with earlier reasoning. Alternatively, maybe the EM interaction does conserve I3. Wait, the photon itself has I3=0. So in electromagnetic processes, maybe I3 is conserved. For example, if a particle with I3= a decays into another particle with I3= b plus a photon (I3=0), then a must equal b. So I3 is conserved. But wait, the photon is part of the U(1) symmetry, not the SU(2) isospin. So perhaps in EM interactions, I3 is not conserved. Wait, but in the decay of the neutral pion (I3=0) to two photons (each I3=0), I3 is conserved. If a charged pion (I3=+1) were to decay electromagnetically, but it doesn't—it decays weakly. So maybe in EM interactions, I3 is conserved. But then, how about other EM processes? For example, proton-proton scattering via EM interaction. The protons have I3=+1/2 each. After scattering, they remain protons, so I3 is conserved. But if there's a process where a neutron (I3=-1/2) is involved in an EM interaction, but neutrons are neutral. Wait, neutrons have a magnetic moment, so they can interact via EM, but their charge is zero. So in EM interactions involving neutrons, I3 would still be -1/2. Hmm. Maybe in EM interactions, I3 is conserved. Then, for (b), I3 conservation would hold for strong and electromagnetic interactions? But that contradicts earlier thoughts. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's clarify: \n\nIsospin (I) and its third component (I3) are conserved in the strong interactions. Electromagnetic interactions break isospin symmetry (since they depend on charge, which is related to I3 and hypercharge), so they do not conserve I. However, does the EM interaction conserve I3? \n\nThe Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula is Q = I3 + (B + S)/2, where B is baryon number and S is strangeness. In electromagnetic interactions, charge Q is conserved. But if B and S are conserved in EM interactions (which they are, as per conservation laws), then I3 must be conserved as well. Because if Q is conserved and B and S are conserved, then I3 must be conserved. Wait, but that would mean that in EM interactions, I3 is conserved. But that can't be right because the EM interaction breaks isospin. Wait, but maybe even though the full isospin symmetry is broken, I3 is still conserved. Let's take an example. Suppose a particle with I=1, I3=0 decays via EM interaction into two particles. If the decay products have I3 summing to 0, then I3 is conserved. For example, the neutral pion (I=1, I3=0) decaying into two photons (each I3=0). So I3 is conserved here. Another example: a rho meson (I=1, I3=+1) decaying into two pions (each I=1, I3=+1 and 0). Wait, but rho decay is a strong interaction. If there were an EM decay, say rho+ -> pi+ and photon. The rho+ has I3=+1, the pi+ has I3=+1, and the photon has I3=0. So total I3 would be +1, which matches the initial I3. So I3 is conserved. But wait, the photon's I3 is 0. So in EM interactions, I3 is conserved. Therefore, perhaps in EM interactions, I3 is conserved, even though the full isospin is not. That would mean that for (b) I3 conservation, the interactions that don't violate it are S and E. But wait, that contradicts some previous understanding. Alternatively, maybe EM interactions do conserve I3. Let me check a reference in my mind. For example, in the electromagnetic interaction, processes conserve electric charge, and since Q is related to I3 and hypercharge, if hypercharge is also conserved, then I3 must be conserved. But hypercharge (Y = B + S) is conserved in EM interactions. So if Q is conserved and Y is conserved, then I3 must be conserved. Therefore, EM interactions conserve I3. Therefore, for (b) I3 conservation, the interactions that conserve it are S and E. Then, the weak interaction does not conserve I3. \n\nWait, but in beta decay (weak interaction), a neutron (I3=-1/2) decays into a proton (I3=+1/2), so I3 changes. Therefore, weak interactions violate I3 conservation. So for (b), the answer would be S and E. But wait, this contradicts my initial thought. Let me verify. \n\nIf EM interactions conserve I3, then (b) I3 conservation holds for S and E. But I need to confirm this. Let's take another example. Consider the decay of the Sigma+ particle, which has I=1, I3=0 (since Sigma+ is part of an isospin triplet with Sigma0 and Sigma-). Wait, no, Sigma particles are in an isospin triplet for Sigma+, Sigma0, Sigma-, but their I3 would be +1, 0, -1. Wait, but Sigma+ has quark content uus, which has I3=+1 (since u quark has I3=+1/2, so two u's give +1, and s is I=0). So Sigma+ has I=1, I3=+1. If it decays electromagnetically, say into a proton (I3=+1/2) and a pion+ (I3=+1). Then total I3 would be +1/2 +1 = +3/2, which doesn't match the initial I3=+1. Therefore, this decay would violate I3. But wait, Sigma+ doesn't decay electromagnetically; it decays weakly. So maybe EM interactions do conserve I3. Alternatively, maybe there's a process where EM interaction changes I3. \n\nAlternatively, consider the photoproduction of pions: gamma + p -> p + pi0. The initial I3: proton has I3=+1/2, photon has I3=0. Final state: proton (I3=+1/2) and pi0 (I3=0). So total I3 is +1/2, same as initial. So I3 is conserved. Another example: gamma + n -> p + pi-. Initial I3: neutron (-1/2) + photon (0) = -1/2. Final: p (+1/2) + pi- (-1) => total I3= +1/2 -1 = -1/2. Conserved. So in these EM processes, I3 is conserved. Therefore, EM interactions do conserve I3. Therefore, for part (b), I3 conservation holds for strong (S) and electromagnetic (E) interactions, and is violated by weak (W). \n\nSo that changes things. Then, for (a) I-spin conservation: strong interactions conserve I, but EM and weak do not. For (b) I3 conservation: strong and EM conserve I3, weak does not. \n\nMoving to (c) strangeness conservation. Strangeness is conserved in strong and electromagnetic interactions but not in weak interactions. Wait, but in strong interactions, strangeness is not conserved. Wait, no: strangeness is conserved in strong interactions only if the process is mediated by the strong force. Wait, actually, the strong interaction conserves strangeness. Wait, no. Wait, the strong force is mediated by gluons, which couple to color charge. Strangeness is a quantum number associated with the presence of strange quarks. In strong interactions, strange quarks can be created or annihilated only in pairs, so processes like kaon decay (which involves a change in strangeness) are weak interactions. Wait, but wait: in strong interactions, strangeness is conserved. For example, the production of strange particles (like kaons) in collisions is via the strong interaction, but they are produced in pairs to conserve strangeness. Wait, no. Actually, the production of strange particles can happen via the strong interaction, but their decay (which changes strangeness) is via the weak interaction. So in strong interactions, strangeness is conserved. Electromagnetic interactions also conserve strangeness. Weak interactions do not. So for (c) strangeness conservation, the interactions that conserve it are S and E, and W violates it. \n\nWait, but wait: in the strong interaction, can strangeness change? For example, in a process where a Lambda baryon (strangeness -1) is produced along with a K+ (strangeness +1) in a collision, the total strangeness is 0, so that's allowed. But if a single strange particle is produced, that would violate strangeness conservation. But since the strong interaction can only create quark-antiquark pairs, you can't produce a single strange quark without an anti-strange. So in strong interactions, strangeness is conserved. Electromagnetic interactions also conserve strangeness because they don't involve changing quark flavors. Weak interactions do change strangeness, like in kaon decay. So (c) strangeness conservation holds for S and E, violated by W. \n\nFinally, (d) invariance under CP. CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation and parity. It was thought to be conserved, but experiments showed that it's violated in weak interactions. The strong and electromagnetic interactions are believed to conserve CP. However, in reality, the strong interaction has a CP problem (the so-called strong CP problem), but no violation has been observed experimentally. So for (d), the interactions that conserve CP are S and E, and W violates it. \n\nWait, but the question says \"for which no violation of the symmetry or conservation law has been observed.\" For CP invariance: in the Standard Model, CP violation occurs in the weak interaction (like in kaon and B-meson systems). The strong interaction is expected to have very small CP violation (the strong CP problem), but experiments have not observed it. So for (d), S and E conserve CP (no observed violation), and W violates it. \n\nNow, compiling the answers:\n\n(a) I-spin conservation: Only strong (S). E and W violate.\n\n(b) I3 conservation: Strong (S) and Electromagnetic (E). Weak (W) violates.\n\n(c) Strangeness conservation: Strong (S) and Electromagnetic (E). Weak (W) violates.\n\n(d) CP invariance: Strong (S) and Electromagnetic (E). Weak (W) violates.\n\nWait, but wait for (d): Are there any experiments showing CP violation in electromagnetic interactions? No, CP violation is only observed in weak interactions. So yes, (d) is conserved in S and E, violated in W.\n\nNow, the next part: for any one of these conservation laws, indicate an experiment which established a violation.\n\nFor example, CP violation was first observed in the decay of neutral kaons (Cronin and Fitch experiment, 1964). They observed that the long-lived neutral kaon (KL) could decay into two pions, which violates CP symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, for strangeness conservation: the observation of strange particles' decay via weak interactions, like kaons decaying into pions, which changes strangeness. But the question is about an experiment that established the violation. The original discovery of strange particles and their long lifetimes (which implied weak decay) showed that strangeness is not conserved in weak interactions. For example, the decay K+ → μ+ νμ would involve a change in strangeness from +1 to 0, hence violating strangeness conservation. The experiment by Lederman, Schwartz, and Steinberger (1962) using neutrinos to produce muons, which helped establish the separate neutrino types, but maybe that's not directly related. Alternatively, the original observation of kaon decays where strangeness changes.\n\nBut the question asks for an experiment that established a violation. For CP violation, the Cronin-Fitch experiment is a good example. For strangeness conservation violation, the original experiments showing that strange particles decay via weak interactions (long lifetimes) indicated that strangeness is not conserved. For example, the decay of the lambda particle (strangeness -1) into proton and pion (strangeness 0) would violate strangeness, and this decay is via the weak interaction. The experiment that established this would be the observation of such decays, which were found to have longer lifetimes, indicating weak interaction. But the specific experiment might be the discovery of V particles (strange particles) in cosmic rays, and subsequent studies showing their decay modes and lifetimes.\n\nBut since the question allows any one, the most famous is the CP violation in kaon decay by Cronin and Fitch. So for part (d), the violation was established by that experiment.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n(a) S\n\n(b) S, E\n\n(c) S, E\n\n(d) S, E\n\nFor each part, the interactions that do not violate the symmetry are listed. Then, for one of them, e.g., (d) CP invariance, the experiment is the 1964 Cronin-Fitch experiment observing CP violation in neutral kaon decay.\n</think>\n\n(a) **$I$-spin conservation**  \n- **Conserved in**: Strong (S)  \n- **Violated by**: Electromagnetic (E), Weak (W)  \n\n(b) **$I_3$ conservation**  \n- **Conserved in**: Strong (S), Electromagnetic (E)  \n- **Violated by**: Weak (W)  \n\n(c) **Strangeness conservation**  \n- **Conserved in**: Strong (S), Electromagnetic (E)  \n- **Violated by**: Weak (W)  \n\n(d) **Invariance under CP**  \n- **Conserved in**: Strong (S), Electromagnetic (E)  \n- **Violated by**: Weak (W)  \n\n**Experiment demonstrating violation**:  \nFor **CP invariance**, the 1964 experiment by Cronin and Fitch observed CP violation in the decay of neutral kaons ($K_L \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-$), demonstrating that the weak interaction violates CP symmetry.  \n\nFinal answers:  \n(a) $\\boxed{\\text{S}}$  \n(b) $\\boxed{\\text{S, E}}$  \n(c) $\\boxed{\\text{S, E}}$  \n(d) $\\boxed{\\text{S, E}}$", "final_answers": ["\\text{S}", "\\text{S, E}", "\\text{S, E}", "\\text{S, E}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{S}", "expr2": "\\text{(a) \\, S}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{S, E}", "expr2": "\\text{(a) \\, S}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{S, E}", "expr2": "\\text{(b) \\, S, E}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{S, E}", "expr2": "\\text{(a) \\, S}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{S, E}", "expr2": "\\text{(b) \\, S, E}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{S, E}", "expr2": "\\text{(a) \\, S}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{S, E}", "expr2": "\\text{(b) \\, S, E}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Let me recall how threshold conditions work in particle physics.\n\nFirst, the basic idea is that in the center-of-momentum frame (CM frame), the total energy must be at least equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products. But since the target is a proton at rest in the lab frame, I might need to use conservation of energy and momentum here. Wait, maybe I should use the invariant quantity, the Mandelstam variable s, which is the square of the total energy in the CM frame. The threshold occurs when all the produced particles are at rest in the CM frame, meaning their kinetic energies are zero. So the total energy in the CM frame must be the sum of their rest masses.\n\nThe reaction in question is π^- + p → K^- + something. Wait, what's the full reaction? To produce a K^-, we need to conserve charge. The pion is π^-, charge -1. The proton is +1. So total initial charge is 0. The K^- has charge -1, so the other products must have total charge +1. Let me think. Possible products could be K^- and a proton and a positive kaon? Wait, no. Wait, maybe the reaction is π^- + p → K^- + K^+ + p? But that might not conserve other quantum numbers. Alternatively, maybe producing a K^- and a Σ particle? Let me check the possible reactions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the production of a K^- requires associated production, where a strange and anti-strange quark are created. For example, π^- (which is u anti-d) and proton (uud) could interact to produce K^- (s anti-u), and then another particle. Let's see: the initial quarks are u, anti-d (from pion) and uud (proton). So combining, maybe we can form s and anti-s. Wait, K^- is s anti-u. So to create that, we need an s quark and an anti-u. The proton has uud. The pion has anti-d and u. Hmm, maybe the reaction is π^- + p → K^- + K^+ + something else? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is π^- + p → K^- + Σ^+? Let's check the conservation laws.\n\nCharge conservation: π^- (-1) + p (+1) = 0. The products must sum to 0. If we produce K^- (-1) and Σ^+ (+1), that would work. Σ^+ has charge +1. Let's check the baryon number. Proton has baryon number 1. Σ^+ is a baryon, so baryon number 1. So initial baryon number is 1 (proton), final is 1 (Σ^+), so that's conserved. Strangeness: π^- has strangeness 0, proton 0. K^- has strangeness -1, Σ^+ has strangeness -1 (since Σ is a strange baryon). So total initial strangeness 0, final is (-1) + (-1) = -2. That's not conserved. Wait, that's a problem. Strangeness is not conserved in strong interactions? Wait, but production of strange particles usually happens via strong interaction, but strangeness is conserved in strong interactions. Wait, no—strangeness is conserved in strong interactions. Wait, actually, no: in the strong interaction, strangeness is not conserved. Wait, no, the strong force conserves strangeness. Wait, no, that's not right. The strong interaction can change strangeness because s quarks can be involved. Wait, no, the strong interaction is mediated by gluons, which don't change flavor. So strong interactions conserve flavor. Therefore, the production of strange particles (like kaons and hyperons) must involve a process where the total strangeness is created in pairs. But wait, in associated production, like in the reaction π^- + p → K^+ + Σ^-, which produces a K^+ (s anti-u) and Σ^- (which has s quarks). Wait, maybe I need to check the actual possible reactions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is π^- + p → K^- + K^+ + p. Let's check charges: -1 +1 = 0. K^- (-1) + K^+ (+1) + p (+1) would sum to +1, which doesn't balance. So that's not possible. Alternatively, π^- + p → K^- + Σ^+ + something else? Hmm. Maybe I need to look up the typical production channels for K^-.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct reaction is π^- + p → K^- + Σ^+ + π^+? Let's check charge: -1 +1 = 0. On the right: -1 (K^-) + +1 (Σ^+) + +1 (π^+) = +1. Not balanced. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe π^- + p → K^- + K^+ + n (neutron). Charge: -1 +1 = 0. K^- (-1) + K^+ (+1) + n (0) = 0. That works. Baryon number: initial 1 (proton), final 1 (neutron). Strangeness: K^- has -1, K^+ has +1, so total strangeness 0. So that's allowed. But does this reaction conserve other quantum numbers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the simplest possible reaction is π^- + p → K^- + Σ^+. Let's check again. Charge: -1 +1 = 0. K^- (-1) + Σ^+ (+1) = 0. Baryon number: initial 1 (proton), final 1 (Σ^+). Strangeness: K^- has -1, Σ^+ has -1 (since Σ^+ is uus), so total strangeness -2. Initial strangeness 0. So that's a problem. Since the reaction would require a change in strangeness by -2, but the strong interaction conserves strangeness. Wait, but if the reaction is via the strong interaction, then it can't change strangeness. Therefore, this reaction is not possible via strong interaction. Therefore, maybe the production of K^- must involve a weak interaction? But that's unlikely because production thresholds are usually considered for strong interactions, which are more probable.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The production of K^- would require creating an s quark and an anti-u quark (since K^- is s anti-u). The initial particles are π^- (which is anti-u and d) and proton (uud). So combining, we have anti-u, d, u, u, d. Wait, the proton is uud, pion is d and anti-u. So total quarks: anti-u, d, u, u, d. To make K^- (s anti-u), we need to create an s quark and an anti-u. Wait, but we already have an anti-u from the pion. So maybe the reaction could be π^- + p → K^- + something that includes an s quark. But where does the s come from? Since the initial particles have no s quarks, we need to create s and anti-s pair via the strong interaction. But the strong interaction can create quark-antiquark pairs, including s and anti-s. So perhaps the reaction is π^- + p → K^- (s anti-u) + K^+ (u anti-s) + proton? But then charge would be -1 +1 = 0. K^- (-1) + K^+ (+1) + p (+1) = +1. Not balanced. Alternatively, maybe π^- + p → K^- + Σ^+ + π^0. Let's check charge: -1 +1 = 0. K^- (-1) + Σ^+ (+1) + π^0 (0) = 0. Baryon number: 1 (proton) → 1 (Σ^+) + 0 (π^0) = 1. Strangeness: K^- (-1) + Σ^+ (-1) = -2. Initial strangeness 0. So that's a problem. Unless the reaction is via the strong interaction, but then strangeness should be conserved. Therefore, this reaction is not possible via strong interaction.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the minimal reaction that can produce a K^- and conserve all quantum numbers. Let's consider the possible final states. Since K^- is a meson (anti-strange and up), and we need to conserve baryon number, charge, strangeness, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is π^- + p → K^- + Σ^+ + π^0. Wait, but as before, strangeness is -2. Alternatively, maybe π^- + p → K^- + K^+ + n. Charge: -1 +1 = 0. K^- (-1) + K^+ (+1) + n (0) = 0. Baryon number: 1 → 1 (n). Strangeness: K^- (-1) + K^+ (+1) = 0. So that works. So the reaction would be π^- + p → K^- + K^+ + n. This conserves charge, baryon number, and strangeness (since K^+ and K^- have opposite strangeness). So that's a possible reaction. Therefore, the threshold would be the minimum energy required to produce these particles: K^-, K^+, and neutron.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler reaction. Let me check standard reactions. For example, the production of a K^- typically requires associated production with another strange particle. For example, π^- + p → K^- + K^+ + n, as above. Alternatively, maybe π^- + p → K^- + Σ^+ + π^0, but that might require more energy.\n\nBut for threshold, we need the minimal energy, which would correspond to the case where all the products are at rest in the CM frame. Therefore, the minimal total energy is the sum of the rest masses of the products. So the threshold condition is that the total energy in the CM frame is equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products. Then, we can relate this to the lab frame where the proton is at rest.\n\nSo the process is: find the minimum energy of the pion in the lab frame such that the reaction can proceed. To do this, we can use the invariant quantity s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2, which must be equal to (sum of rest masses)^2 c^4.\n\nIn the lab frame, the proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c^2, and the pion has energy E_π = γ m_π c^2, and momentum p_π = γ m_π v. But since we're dealing with relativistic energies, it's better to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\nThe invariant s is given by s = (E_π + E_p)^2 - (p_π c + p_p)^2. Since the proton is at rest, p_p = 0, so s = (E_π + m_p c^2)^2 - (p_π c)^2.\n\nExpanding this: s = E_π^2 + 2 E_π m_p c^2 + m_p^2 c^4 - p_π^2 c^2.\n\nBut for the pion, E_π^2 = (p_π c)^2 + m_π^2 c^4. So substituting that in:\n\ns = (p_π^2 c^2 + m_π^2 c^4) + 2 E_π m_p c^2 + m_p^2 c^4 - p_π^2 c^2\n\nSimplify:\n\ns = m_π^2 c^4 + 2 E_π m_p c^2 + m_p^2 c^4\n\nAt threshold, s must equal the square of the sum of the rest masses of the products. Let's assume the reaction is π^- + p → K^- + K^+ + n. Then the sum of the rest masses is m_K^- + m_K^+ + m_n. But since K^- and K^+ have the same mass, and neutron mass is similar to proton, let's denote m_K as the kaon mass and m_N as the nucleon mass (proton or neutron). So sum of rest masses is 2 m_K + m_n. But actually, the neutron mass is slightly larger than the proton, but for approximation, maybe we can take m_n ≈ m_p. However, let's be precise.\n\nAlternatively, if the reaction is π^- + p → K^- + Σ^+ + π^0, then the sum would be m_K + m_Σ + m_π. But this might require more energy. However, earlier analysis suggested that such a reaction might not conserve strangeness if done via strong interaction. So perhaps the correct reaction is π^- + p → K^- + K^+ + n.\n\nAssuming that, then the threshold s is (m_K^- + m_K^+ + m_n)^2 c^4. But since K^- and K^+ have the same mass, m_K, and m_n is the neutron mass, so s = (2 m_K + m_n)^2 c^4.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to find the threshold for K^- production, regardless of the other products. So the minimal possible s would be when the other products have the least possible mass. Wait, but K^- has to be produced, so we need to find the minimal mass of the other particles required to conserve quantum numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal reaction is π^- + p → K^- + Σ^+ (as earlier), but we saw that this might violate strangeness conservation. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is π^- + p → K^- + K^+ + n, which conserves all quantum numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a reaction with fewer particles. Let me check the quark content. The initial state is π^- (d anti-u) and proton (uud). So combining, we have d anti-u + uud = d + anti-u + u + u + d. Rearranging, that's 2u + 2d + anti-u. To form a K^- (s anti-u), we need an s quark and an anti-u. The anti-u is already present from the pion. So we need to create an s quark and its anti-s partner (since strong interaction can create s anti-s pairs). Then, the s quark combines with the anti-u to make K^-, and the anti-s combines with something else. But the remaining quarks are 2u + 2d + anti-u (from initial). Wait, maybe the anti-s pairs with a u to make K^+ (u anti-s). Then, the remaining quarks would be 2u + 2d + anti-u - u (used in K^+) = u + 2d + anti-u. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the remaining quarks form a neutron (udd). So combining, we have K^- (s anti-u), K^+ (u anti-s), and neutron (udd). Let's check:\n\nFrom initial quarks: d (from pion) + anti-u (from pion) + uud (proton) = anti-u + u + u + d + d.\n\nTo form K^- (s anti-u), we need s and anti-u. The anti-u is present. To create s, we need s and anti-s from the strong interaction. Then, the s combines with anti-u to make K^-. The anti-s combines with a u to make K^+ (u anti-s). The remaining quarks are u + d + d. Which is a neutron (udd). So yes, this works. Therefore, the reaction π^- + p → K^- + K^+ + n is possible via strong interaction, conserving all quantum numbers.\n\nTherefore, the threshold energy would be determined by the sum of the rest masses of K^-, K^+, and neutron. So the total rest mass in the CM frame at threshold is m_K + m_K + m_n = 2 m_K + m_n.\n\nNow, we need to compute the threshold energy in the lab frame where the proton is at rest. The invariant s must be equal to (sum of rest masses)^2 c^4. So:\n\ns = (E_π + m_p c^2)^2 - (p_π c)^2 = (2 m_K + m_n)^2 c^4\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n(E_π + m_p c^2)^2 - (p_π c)^2 = E_π^2 + 2 E_π m_p c^2 + m_p^2 c^4 - p_π^2 c^2\n\nBut E_π^2 = (p_π c)^2 + m_π^2 c^4, so substituting:\n\n= (p_π^2 c^2 + m_π^2 c^4) + 2 E_π m_p c^2 + m_p^2 c^4 - p_π^2 c^2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= m_π^2 c^4 + 2 E_π m_p c^2 + m_p^2 c^4\n\nSet equal to (2 m_K + m_n)^2 c^4:\n\nm_π^2 c^4 + 2 E_π m_p c^2 + m_p^2 c^4 = (2 m_K + m_n)^2 c^4\n\nDivide both sides by c^4:\n\nm_π^2 + 2 E_π m_p + m_p^2 = (2 m_K + m_n)^2\n\nSolve for E_π:\n\n2 E_π m_p = (2 m_K + m_n)^2 - m_p^2 - m_π^2\n\nE_π = [ (2 m_K + m_n)^2 - m_p^2 - m_π^2 ] / (2 m_p)\n\nBut E_π is the total energy of the pion, which includes its rest mass and kinetic energy. The threshold kinetic energy T_π is E_π - m_π c^2. Wait, but we need to be careful with units. Let's assume all masses are in units of energy (e.g., MeV/c² and multiplied by c² to get energy).\n\nLet me plug in the actual masses. Let's look up the masses:\n\n- Pion (π^-): approximately 139.57 MeV/c²\n- Proton (p): 938.272 MeV/c²\n- Kaon (K^-): 493.677 MeV/c²\n- Neutron (n): 939.565 MeV/c²\n\nSo:\n\n2 m_K = 2 * 493.677 = 987.354 MeV/c²\n\nm_n = 939.565 MeV/c²\n\nSum: 987.354 + 939.565 = 1926.919 MeV/c²\n\nSo (2 m_K + m_n)^2 = (1926.919)^2 (MeV/c²)^2\n\nSimilarly, m_p = 938.272 MeV/c²\n\nm_π = 139.57 MeV/c²\n\nNow compute the numerator:\n\n(1926.919)^2 - (938.272)^2 - (139.57)^2\n\nFirst calculate each term:\n\n1926.919² ≈ (1900 + 26.919)² ≈ 1900² + 2*1900*26.919 + 26.919² ≈ 3,610,000 + 102,292.2 + 724.5 ≈ 3,713,016.7 MeV²/c⁴\n\n938.272² ≈ (900 + 38.272)² ≈ 810,000 + 2*900*38.272 + 38.272² ≈ 810,000 + 68,889.6 + 1,464.7 ≈ 880,354.3 MeV²/c⁴\n\n139.57² ≈ 19,479.3 MeV²/c⁴\n\nSo numerator ≈ 3,713,016.7 - 880,354.3 - 19,479.3 ≈ 3,713,016.7 - 899,833.6 ≈ 2,813,183.1 MeV²/c⁴\n\nDenominator: 2 m_p = 2 * 938.272 = 1,876.544 MeV/c²\n\nSo E_π ≈ 2,813,183.1 / 1,876.544 ≈ 1,500 MeV (approximately)\n\nWait, let's compute it more accurately:\n\n2,813,183.1 / 1,876.544 ≈ let's divide numerator and denominator by 1,000: 2,813.1831 / 1.876544 ≈\n\n1.876544 * 1500 = 1.876544 * 1000 + 1.876544 * 500 = 1,876.544 + 938.272 = 2,814.816\n\nWhich is very close to the numerator 2,813.1831. So approximately 1,500 - (2,814.816 - 2,813.1831)/1.876544 ≈ 1,500 - 1.6329/1.876544 ≈ 1,500 - 0.87 ≈ 1499.13 MeV.\n\nSo E_π ≈ 1499.13 MeV.\n\nBut the rest mass energy of the pion is 139.57 MeV, so the kinetic energy T_π = E_π - m_π c² ≈ 1499.13 - 139.57 ≈ 1,359.56 MeV.\n\nBut wait, this seems very high. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (2 m_K + m_n)^2.\n\nLet me recompute:\n\n2 m_K = 2 * 493.677 = 987.354 MeV/c²\n\nm_n = 939.565 MeV/c²\n\nSum: 987.354 + 939.565 = 1926.919 MeV/c²\n\nSquare: (1926.919)^2 = let's compute this accurately:\n\n1926.919 * 1926.919\n\nFirst compute 1926 * 1926 = ?\n\nBut this is time-consuming. Alternatively, note that (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², where a=1900, b=26.919\n\nSo (1900 + 26.919)^2 = 1900² + 2*1900*26.919 + 26.919²\n\n1900² = 3,610,000\n\n2*1900*26.919 = 3800 * 26.919 ≈ 3800*26 + 3800*0.919 ≈ 98,800 + 3,492.2 ≈ 102,292.2\n\n26.919² ≈ 725\n\nSo total ≈ 3,610,000 + 102,292.2 + 725 ≈ 3,713,017.2 MeV²/c⁴\n\nThen subtract m_p² + m_π² = (938.272)^2 + (139.57)^2\n\nCompute 938.272²:\n\nAgain, (900 + 38.272)^2 = 900² + 2*900*38.272 + 38.272²\n\n= 810,000 + 68,889.6 + 1,464.7 ≈ 880,354.3\n\n139.57² ≈ 19,479.3\n\nTotal subtraction: 880,354.3 + 19,479.3 = 899,833.6\n\nSo numerator: 3,713,017.2 - 899,833.6 = 2,813,183.6 MeV²/c⁴\n\nDenominator: 2 m_p = 2 * 938.272 = 1,876.544 MeV/c²\n\nSo E_π = 2,813,183.6 / 1,876.544 ≈ let's compute this division.\n\n1,876.544 * 1,500 = 2,814,816 MeV/c²\n\nBut our numerator is 2,813,183.6, which is 1,632.4 less than 2,814,816.\n\nSo E_π = 1,500 - (1,632.4 / 1,876.544) ≈ 1,500 - 0.87 ≈ 1,499.13 MeV\n\nSo E_π ≈ 1,499.13 MeV\n\nThen the kinetic energy T_π = E_π - m_π = 1,499.13 - 139.57 ≈ 1,359.56 MeV\n\nBut this seems very high. Is this realistic? Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for threshold energy in the lab frame:\n\nT_th = [(sum M)^2 - (m_p + m_π)^2]/(2 m_p)\n\nWhere sum M is the sum of the rest masses of the products.\n\nWait, the general formula for the threshold kinetic energy when a projectile hits a stationary target is:\n\nT_th = [(sum M)^2 - (m_p + m_π)^2]/(2 m_p)\n\nWhere sum M is the total rest mass of the products.\n\nIn this case, sum M = m_K^- + m_K^+ + m_n = 2*493.677 + 939.565 = 987.354 + 939.565 = 1926.919 MeV/c²\n\nSo:\n\nT_th = [ (1926.919)^2 - (938.272 + 139.57)^2 ] / (2 * 938.272)\n\nCompute denominator first: 2 * 938.272 = 1876.544\n\nCompute (938.272 + 139.57) = 1077.842 MeV/c²\n\nSquare that: (1077.842)^2 = let's compute:\n\n(1000 + 77.842)^2 = 1,000,000 + 2*1000*77.842 + 77.842²\n\n= 1,000,000 + 155,684 + 6,058.6 ≈ 1,161,742.6 MeV²/c⁴\n\nThen sum M squared is (1926.919)^2 ≈ 3,713,017.2 MeV²/c⁴\n\nSo numerator: 3,713,017.2 - 1,161,742.6 ≈ 2,551,274.6 MeV²/c⁴\n\nThen T_th = 2,551,274.6 / 1876.544 ≈ 1,359.5 MeV\n\nWhich matches the previous result. So the threshold kinetic energy is approximately 1,359.5 MeV, or about 1.36 GeV.\n\nBut wait, this seems quite high. Is there a reaction with a lower threshold? For example, if the reaction produces fewer particles, the sum M would be smaller, leading to a lower threshold.\n\nEarlier, I considered the reaction π^- + p → K^- + Σ^+, but that might not conserve strangeness. Let's check again. If the reaction is π^- + p → K^- + Σ^+, then sum M = m_K + m_Σ^+.\n\nThe Σ^+ mass is approximately 1,189.37 MeV/c². So sum M = 493.677 + 1,189.37 ≈ 1,683.05 MeV/c².\n\nThen T_th would be [ (1,683.05)^2 - (938.272 + 139.57)^2 ] / (2 * 938.272)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n(1,683.05)^2 ≈ 2,832,700 MeV²/c⁴\n\n(938.272 + 139.57)^2 = 1,077.842² ≈ 1,161,742.6 as before\n\nNumerator: 2,832,700 - 1,161,742.6 ≈ 1,670,957.4\n\nDivide by 2 * 938.272 = 1,876.544\n\nT_th ≈ 1,670,957.4 / 1,876.544 ≈ 890 MeV\n\nThis is lower than the previous 1.36 GeV. But does this reaction conserve strangeness?\n\nInitial strangeness: 0 (pion and proton have S=0)\n\nFinal strangeness: K^- has S=-1, Σ^+ has S=-1 (since Σ^+ is uus), so total S=-2. This violates strangeness conservation in the strong interaction. Therefore, this reaction cannot proceed via the strong interaction. Hence, the threshold would be higher if it's a weak interaction process, but typically, production thresholds are considered for strong processes since weak processes have much lower probabilities.\n\nTherefore, the correct reaction must conserve strangeness. Hence, the reaction π^- + p → K^- + K^+ + n is allowed, with total strangeness 0 (-1 +1 +0), so that's okay. Therefore, the threshold energy calculated as ~1.36 GeV is correct.\n\nBut wait, another possible reaction is π^- + p → K^- + Λ + K^+, where Λ is a lambda baryon. Let's check:\n\nCharge: -1 +1 = 0 → K^- (-1) + Λ (0) + K^+ (+1) = 0. Baryon number: 1 → Λ (1) + K^+ (0) + K^- (0) = 1. Strangeness: K^- (-1), K^+ (+1), Λ (-1). Total: -1 +1 -1 = -1. Not conserved. So that's no good.\n\nAlternatively, π^- + p → K^- + p + K^0. Charge: -1 +1 = 0 → K^- (-1) + p (+1) + K^0 (0) = 0. Baryon number: 1 → 1 (p). Strangeness: K^- (-1) + K^0 (0) = -1. Initial strangeness 0. Not conserved. So no.\n\nAlternatively, π^- + p → K^- + Σ^0 + π^+. Charge: -1 +1 = 0 → K^- (-1) + Σ^0 (0) + π^+ (+1) = 0. Baryon number: 1 → Σ^0 (1) + π^+ (0) = 1. Strangeness: K^- (-1) + Σ^0 (-1) = -2. Initial 0. Not conserved.\n\nHmm. It seems the only viable reaction that conserves all quantum numbers is π^- + p → K^- + K^+ + n. Therefore, the threshold energy is indeed around 1.36 GeV.\n\nBut let me confirm with another source or formula. The general formula for the threshold kinetic energy when the target is at rest is:\n\nT_th = [(sum M)^2 - (m_p + m_π)^2]/(2 m_p)\n\nWhere sum M is the sum of the rest masses of all products.\n\nIn this case, sum M = m_K^- + m_K^+ + m_n = 2*493.677 + 939.565 = 1926.919 MeV/c²\n\nSo:\n\nT_th = (1926.919² - (938.272 + 139.57)²) / (2*938.272)\n\nAs calculated earlier, this gives approximately 1,359.5 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the threshold kinetic energy is approximately 1.36 GeV.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about this is using the center-of-momentum frame. The threshold occurs when the total energy in the CM frame is equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products. The energy in the lab frame must be such that when boosted to the CM frame, the total energy meets this condition.\n\nAlternatively, using the relation:\n\ns = (E_lab)^2 - (p_lab c)^2 = (sum M c^2)^2\n\nBut E_lab is the total energy in the lab frame, which is E_π + m_p c^2, and p_lab is the momentum of the pion.\n\nBut this is the same as the earlier approach.\n\nTherefore, the threshold kinetic energy of the pion is approximately 1.36 GeV.\n</think>\n\nThe threshold kinetic energy for producing a \\( K^- \\) meson in the reaction \\( \\pi^- + p \\rightarrow K^- + K^+ + n \\) is determined by the conservation of energy and momentum. The invariant quantity \\( s \\), which is the square of the total energy in the center-of-momentum (CM) frame, must equal the square of the sum of the rest masses of the products. \n\nUsing the formula for the threshold kinetic energy in the lab frame where the proton is stationary:\n\n\\[\nT_{\\text{threshold}} = \\frac{( \\sum M )^2 - (m_p + m_\\pi)^2}{2 m_p}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\sum M = 2 m_K + m_n \\) is the sum of the rest masses of the products.

{"id": "atomic/3-1", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The question is asking about the 'strength' of the fundamental interactions and how they're compared. I remember that in particle physics, the strength of an interaction is related to the coupling constant. Each force has a coupling constant that determines how strongly the particles interact. For example, the electromagnetic force has the fine-structure constant α ≈ 1/137, which is a dimensionless quantity. The strong force has a larger coupling constant, maybe around 1, which makes it stronger. But wait, coupling constants can depend on the energy scale due to the running of couplings in quantum field theory. So when comparing strengths, we need to specify the energy scale. Typically, comparisons are made at the energy scale of the particles involved, like the mass of the Z boson (~90 GeV) for weak interactions. The strength can also be related to the interaction range; stronger forces might have shorter ranges, but gravitational is long-range and weak. Hmm, but how exactly do we quantify the strength? Maybe by the cross-section of scattering processes or the lifetime of particles decaying via that interaction. For example, strong interactions have larger cross-sections (more probable) and shorter lifetimes, while weak interactions have smaller cross-sections and longer lifetimes. So the strength is a measure of the probability of interaction occurring, which relates to the coupling constant squared. So when they say strength is in order strong, electromagnetic, weak, gravitational, they're referring to the relative magnitudes of their coupling constants at a certain energy, leading to differences in interaction probabilities and timescales.\n\nFor part (b), each interaction has different conservation laws. Let's go through each:\n\nStrong interaction: It conserves all charges—electric charge, baryon number, lepton number. Also, it conserves parity (P), charge conjugation (C), and time reversal (T) individually. Wait, but wait, the strong force is mediated by gluons which carry color charge. So color must be conserved. But in terms of conservation laws, strong interactions conserve things like baryon number and strangeness? Wait, no, strangeness is not conserved in strong interactions. Wait, actually, in strong interactions, strangeness is not conserved. For example, in decays of particles via the strong force, strangeness can change. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up. The strong interaction conserves baryon number, but not strangeness. Electromagnetic interactions conserve strangeness? No, electromagnetic can change strangeness if the process allows. Wait, let me recall. Conservation laws: \n\nStrong interaction: Conserves electric charge, baryon number, lepton number (since leptons don't participate in strong interactions), color charge. Also, parity (P) is conserved in strong interactions. But experiments like the tau-theta puzzle showed that weak interactions violate parity, but strong and electromagnetic conserve it. Wait, but wait, the strong force was thought to conserve parity, but actually, experiments confirm that parity is conserved in strong interactions. For example, certain decays that proceed via strong forces would show parity conservation. \n\nElectromagnetic interaction: Conserves electric charge, baryon number, lepton number, but also C, P, and T? Wait, no. Electromagnetic interactions conserve parity and charge conjugation? Wait, the pion decay: neutral pion decays electromagnetically to two photons. The pion has parity -1, and two photons have parity (+1)^2 = +1. So that would violate parity, but wait, the pion decay is actually via electromagnetic interaction. Wait, but the neutral pion decay is primarily electromagnetic, and the parity argument would suggest that parity is violated. But wait, the pion is a pseudoscalar (spin 0, parity -1), and the photon is a vector (spin 1, parity -1). So two photons would have combined parity (+1). So the decay π0 → γγ would require parity violation if the initial parity is -1 and final is +1. But since the decay happens, does that mean parity isn't conserved in EM interactions? Wait, but EM interactions are supposed to conserve parity. Hmm, maybe I'm confused here. Alternatively, maybe the parity of the pion is such that the decay is allowed. Let me think: the pion has J^P = 0^-. The two-photon state must have even parity because each photon has parity -1, so (-1)^2 = +1. The pion's parity is -1, so the matrix element would have to connect a -1 to +1, which would require parity violation. But since the decay does occur, that suggests that EM interactions do not conserve parity. But that contradicts what I thought earlier. Wait, but the neutral pion decay is allowed because the interaction responsible (EM) does conserve parity. How does that work? Maybe the matrix element is non-zero despite the parity difference. Wait, perhaps the parity is conserved in the interaction. Let me check: the electromagnetic interaction Hamiltonian should be parity invariant. The pion is a pseudoscalar, so under parity, it changes sign. The electromagnetic interaction term would involve the pion field interacting with the electromagnetic field. If the interaction term is parity invariant, then the process would be allowed. For example, the interaction Lagrangian might have a term like π0 F_{μν} F^{μν}, where F is the electromagnetic field tensor. F_{μν} is a tensor that under parity transforms as P: F_{μν} → ... Hmm, F_{0i} (electric field) is a vector, and F_{ij} (magnetic field) is a pseudovector. So F_{μν} F^{μν} is a scalar under parity? Let's see: F_{μν} F^{μν} = 2(B² - E²). Since E is a vector and B is a pseudovector, B² and E² are both scalars, so F^2 is a scalar. Therefore, the term π0 F^2 would be a pseudoscalar (since π0 is pseudoscalar) times a scalar, resulting in a pseudoscalar. But the Lagrangian must be a scalar, so this term would violate parity. But the neutral pion does decay via this interaction, which would imply that the electromagnetic interaction violates parity. But that's not correct. Wait, but the decay π0 → γγ is allowed because the interaction is parity-conserving. Maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the decay is actually due to the chiral anomaly or something else. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should recall that the electromagnetic interaction conserves parity, charge conjugation, and combined CP. But experiments show that EM conserves P and C. For example, the selection rules in atomic transitions respect parity conservation. So the pion decay must be compatible with parity conservation. Maybe the initial and final states have the same parity. Wait, the pion is 0^-, and the two photons must have a combined parity of +1. How is that possible? Each photon has parity -1, so two photons would have parity (-1)^2 = +1. But the pion has parity -1. So the matrix element would have to connect a parity -1 initial state to a parity +1 final state. That would require a parity-odd interaction, which would violate parity. But since the decay occurs, this suggests that the interaction responsible violates parity. But EM is supposed to conserve parity. This is a contradiction. Wait, maybe the decay is actually due to the axial anomaly, which allows this process even though it's parity-conserving. Hmm, perhaps the interaction term is parity-conserving. Let me think again: the QED Lagrangian is parity-conserving. The term that allows π0 → γγ is an effective interaction coming from the triangle anomaly, which is a quantum effect. The effective interaction term is of the form π0 ε^{μνρσ} F_{μν} F_{ρσ}, which is a pseudoscalar (since ε is a pseudotensor) multiplied by F^2 terms. Wait, ε is the Levi-Civita symbol, which makes the term a pseudoscalar. Therefore, such a term would violate parity. But QED is parity-conserving. How does this happen? The anomaly allows processes that seem to violate classical symmetries at the quantum level. So the π0 decay is a result of the axial anomaly, which is a quantum effect in QED. Therefore, even though QED is parity-conserving, this decay is allowed because the anomaly provides a way for the pion to decay without violating parity. Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Maybe the key point is that the electromagnetic interaction does conserve parity, and the pion decay is allowed due to the anomaly, which is a part of the quantum theory. So in terms of conservation laws, EM interactions do conserve parity. Therefore, the decay must somehow conserve parity. Maybe the initial and final states have the same parity. Let me recalculate: π0 is J^P = 0^-. The two-photon state must have total angular momentum 0. Each photon has spin 1, so to get spin 0, their spins must be opposite. The parity of each photon is -1. For two photons, the parity is (-1)^2 = +1. But the pion has parity -1. So how is this possible? Unless there's an additional factor. Wait, the spatial part of the wavefunction might contribute. For two photons, the wavefunction must be symmetric under exchange. Since photons are bosons. The spatial part for two photons in a spin-0 state would have even orbital angular momentum. Let's say the orbital angular momentum L=0 (s-wave). Then the parity would be (+1) from spatial part multiplied by (-1)^2 = +1. So total parity is +1. But the pion has parity -1. So this seems like a parity mismatch. Therefore, the decay would violate parity. But since the decay occurs, and EM is supposed to conserve parity, this is a problem. Therefore, maybe the decay is not purely electromagnetic? Wait, the neutral pion decay is primarily electromagnetic, but the process is allowed due to the axial anomaly. The anomaly allows the pion to decay even though, classically, the symmetry would forbid it. So in the quantum theory, the symmetry is broken by the anomaly. Therefore, the decay proceeds even though the interaction (QED) is parity-conserving. Therefore, the conservation laws for EM would still include parity conservation, but the anomaly allows this particular process. Hmm, this is getting too deep. Maybe for the purpose of this question, the key point is that electromagnetic interactions conserve electric charge, parity, charge conjugation, etc., except for processes allowed by anomalies. But perhaps the answer expects that EM conserves parity, charge conjugation, etc., and the example of pion decay is an exception due to the anomaly, but generally, EM conserves those. Alternatively, maybe the decay is considered a strong interaction process? No, the neutral pion decay is electromagnetic. Hmm. Maybe I should move on and check the standard conservation laws.\n\nStrong interaction: Conserves color charge, electric charge, baryon number, strangeness? Wait, no. Wait, in strong interactions, strangeness is not conserved. For example, in processes like K+ → π+ π0, which is a strong decay? Wait, no, K+ decay is weak. Wait, particles like the Λ baryon decay via the weak interaction. Wait, maybe in strong interactions, strangeness can change. For example, the decay of a Σ particle via strong interaction? Wait, Σ particles typically decay via the strong force, but their lifetimes are around 1e-10 seconds, which is characteristic of strong decays. Wait, but Σ+ → p π0. The strangeness of Σ+ is -1, and the proton has strangeness 0, so strangeness changes by +1. But if this decay is via the strong interaction, then strangeness is not conserved. Therefore, strong interactions do not conserve strangeness. So conservation laws for strong: electric charge, baryon number, color charge, but not strangeness. Wait, but wait, in the quark model, strong interactions are mediated by gluons which change color but not flavor. So flavor (like up, down, strange) is conserved in strong interactions? Wait, no. For example, a quark can emit a gluon, which can split into quark-antiquark pairs of different flavors? No, gluons are flavor-neutral. Gluons carry color but not flavor. Therefore, strong interactions do not change flavor. So in strong interactions, the flavor (like up, down, strange) is conserved. Therefore, processes that change strangeness must involve weak interactions. Wait, but earlier example of Σ+ decaying to p π0 would require changing strangeness from -1 to 0. If that's a strong decay, then that would mean strangeness is not conserved. But if the Σ+ is made of uus, and the proton is uud, then the s quark must be converted to a u or d. But that requires changing flavor, which can't happen via strong interactions. Therefore, Σ+ decay must be weak. Wait, but the Σ+ has a lifetime around 0.8e-10 seconds, which is typical of weak decays. So maybe I was wrong earlier. The Σ+ decay is weak, hence strangeness is not conserved. Therefore, strong interactions do conserve strangeness. Wait, this is confusing. Let me recall: the strong interaction conserves flavor (up, down, strange, etc.) because the gluons don't change flavor. Therefore, any process mediated by the strong force cannot change the flavor of the quarks. Therefore, in strong interactions, the number of each flavor quark is conserved. Therefore, strangeness is conserved in strong interactions. But wait, particles like the kaon (K+) which are made of u and anti-s, can they decay via strong interaction? If strangeness is conserved, then K+ (S=+1) would have to decay into particles with total S=+1. But the possible decay products via strong interaction would be, say, π+ π0, which have S=0. Therefore, that decay would violate strangeness conservation, hence cannot proceed via strong interaction. Therefore, K+ decay must be weak, which it is (lifetime ~1e-8 seconds). Therefore, strong interactions conserve strangeness. But wait, the Σ particles decay via strong interaction? No, their lifetimes are ~1e-10 seconds, which is actually shorter than weak decays. Wait, no, weak decays are usually longer, like 1e-8 to 1e-13 seconds. Wait, the classification is: strong decays (lifetimes ~1e-23 seconds), electromagnetic (~1e-16 to 1e-20), weak (~1e-8 to 1e-13). So Σ particles have lifetimes around 1e-10 seconds, which is weak decay. Therefore, strong interactions conserve strangeness. Therefore, in strong interactions, the conservation laws are: electric charge, baryon number, strangeness, parity, etc. Wait, but earlier example of the pion decay. Wait, the pion is made of up and anti-up or down and anti-down. So its strangeness is zero. If it decays electromagnetically, then strangeness is conserved. So in strong interactions, strangeness is conserved. Therefore, the conservation laws for strong interaction are: electric charge, baryon number, strangeness, parity, and others like isospin. Wait, isospin is conserved in strong interactions. Yes, because the strong force is symmetric under isospin rotations (up and down quarks treated similarly). So for part (b), strong interaction conserves electric charge, baryon number, strangeness, isospin, parity. Electromagnetic interaction conserves electric charge, baryon number, but not isospin (since it differentiates between up and down quarks due to their charges), and conserves parity? Wait, earlier confusion about pion decay. But if EM conserves parity, then the pion decay must be allowed under parity conservation. But how? Maybe the parity is conserved in the interaction. Let's accept that EM conserves parity. Then, for electromagnetic interactions, conservation laws are electric charge, baryon number, lepton number, parity, but not isospin. Weak interaction: Doesn't conserve parity (parity violation observed in beta decay), doesn't conserve charge conjugation (C), but maybe conserves CP? No, CP violation exists. Weak interactions also don't conserve strangeness, but they conserve electric charge? Wait, weak interactions can change electric charge, like in beta decay where a neutron (charge 0) decays into a proton (charge +1), electron (charge -1), and antineutrino (charge 0). So total charge is conserved. So electric charge is conserved. Baryon number is conserved (neutron and proton are baryons, electron and neutrino are leptons). Lepton number is conserved. But weak interactions do not conserve parity, C, or CP (since CP violation is observed). Also, weak interactions do not conserve flavor (strangeness, charm, etc.), except in some cases (like charged current vs. neutral current). For example, in beta decay, a down quark changes to an up quark, changing flavor. So weak interactions violate flavor conservation. So for each interaction:\n\nStrong: Conserves electric charge, baryon number, strangeness (flavor), isospin, parity.\n\nElectromagnetic: Conserves electric charge, baryon number, lepton number, parity, but not isospin or strangeness (since photons don't interact with strangeness, but EM can cause transitions that change strangeness if allowed by other conservation laws? Wait, no. If EM interactions conserve flavor, then they would conserve strangeness. But wait, EM interactions couple to electric charge, which depends on flavor. So for example, a strange quark (charge -1/3) can emit a photon, which doesn't change its flavor. So EM interactions conserve flavor, hence strangeness. Therefore, EM conserves electric charge, baryon number, lepton number, strangeness, parity, but not isospin (since isospin is broken by EM interactions).\n\nWait, but isospin is a symmetry of the strong interaction. Electromagnetic interactions break isospin because they treat up and down quarks differently (different charges). Therefore, EM interactions do not conserve isospin. So for conservation laws:\n\nStrong interaction: Electric charge, baryon number, strangeness (flavor), isospin, parity.\n\nElectromagnetic: Electric charge, baryon number, strangeness (flavor), parity, but not isospin.\n\nWeak interaction: Electric charge, baryon number, lepton number (but not individual lepton numbers if neutrinos mix), but does not conserve parity, charge conjugation, strangeness, charm, etc. (flavor violation), and does not conserve isospin.\n\nWait, but in weak interactions, for example, in beta decay, the process conserves electric charge, baryon number, and lepton number. However, it changes the flavor (up/down quarks), so strangeness can change. But in some weak processes, like neutral current interactions, flavor is conserved. For example, a neutrino scattering via Z boson (neutral current) doesn't change flavor. But charged current interactions do change flavor. So weak interactions can change flavor (hence strangeness) in charged current processes but not in neutral currents. But overall, weak interactions do not conserve flavor (strangeness, charm, etc.), except in neutral currents. However, the question asks for conservation laws that apply to the interaction. So for weak interactions, the conservation laws are electric charge, baryon number, and lepton number (though in some cases like neutrino oscillations, lepton flavor is not conserved, but total lepton number is). Wait, but in the Standard Model, total lepton number is conserved, but individual lepton numbers (e, μ, τ) are not conserved if neutrinos have mass. However, in the minimal Standard Model without neutrino masses, individual lepton numbers are conserved. But given that neutrinos have mass, individual lepton numbers are not conserved. But the question might expect the traditional answer that weak interactions conserve lepton number but not lepton flavor. However, the question says \"state what conservation laws apply to the interaction\" and \"justify by experimental evidence\". For example, parity violation was discovered in weak interactions (Wu experiment), so parity is not conserved. Charge conjugation is also violated (e.g., the decay of polarized muons shows that the emitted electrons are preferentially left-handed, which would not be the case under C symmetry). However, the combination CP was thought to be conserved, but CP violation was observed in kaon systems. So weak interactions violate C, P, and CP. But they still conserve electric charge, baryon number, and lepton number (total, not individual flavors). So putting this all together:\n\n(a) The 'strength' refers to the coupling constant governing the interaction. The relative strengths are compared using the dimensionless coupling constants at a specific energy scale (typically the Z boson mass scale for weak interactions). For example, strong (α_s ~ 1), electromagnetic (α ~ 1/137), weak (α_w ~ 10^-6), gravitational (α_g ~ 10^-39). The strength determines the interaction probability (cross-section) and decay rates (lifetimes). Stronger interactions have larger cross-sections and shorter lifetimes.\n\n(b) Conservation laws:\n\n- Strong: Conserves electric charge, baryon number, strangeness (flavor), isospin, parity. Justification: Strong processes (like hadron decays) conserve these quantities. For example, Δ++ → p π+ conserves charge, baryon number, and parity. Isospin conservation is seen in nuclear reactions.\n\n- Electromagnetic: Conserves electric charge, baryon number, parity, but not isospin. Justification: EM processes (like atomic transitions) conserve parity (selection rules), and decays like π0 → γγ (via anomaly) still conserve charge. Isospin is broken as seen in mass splittings in nuclei.\n\n- Weak: Conserves electric charge, baryon number, lepton number (total), but violates parity, charge conjugation, and flavor (strangeness, etc.). Justification: Parity violation observed in beta decay (Wu experiment), CP violation in kaons, and flavor change in beta decay (neutron → proton).\n</think>\n\n(a) The 'strength' of an interaction refers to the dimensionless coupling constant that quantifies the probability of particles interacting via that force. These constants are energy-dependent due to the renormalization group flow. At the energy scale of the Z boson mass (~90 GeV), the approximate relative strengths are:  \n- **Strong interaction**: Coupling constant \\(\\alpha_s \\sim 1\\)  \n- **Electromagnetic interaction**: Fine-structure constant \\(\\alpha \\approx 1/137\\)  \n- **Weak interaction**: Fermi coupling \\(G_F \\sim 10^{-5} \\, \\text{GeV}^{-2}\\), corresponding to \\(\\alpha_w \\sim 10^{-6}\\)  \n- **Gravitational interaction**: \\(\\alpha_g \\sim 10^{-39}\\) (using Planck mass normalization).  \n\nThe relative strengths are determined by comparing interaction cross-sections (probability of occurrence) and decay lifetimes.

{"id": "atomic/3-30", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to show that the two neutrons produced in the reaction π⁻ + d → n + n must be in a singlet state. Let me start by recalling what a singlet state is. A singlet state refers to a state with total spin quantum number S=0, which means the spins of the two neutrons are antiparallel, resulting in a total spin of zero. Since neutrons are fermions, their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. The overall wavefunction is a product of spatial and spin parts. If the spin part is a singlet (antisymmetric), then the spatial part must be symmetric, and vice versa.\n\nNow, the problem states that the deuteron has spin-parity 1⁺. The pion (π⁻) is given as spin 0 with negative intrinsic parity. The reaction is capturing the pion from a p orbit. Let me break down the conservation laws that apply here. In any nuclear reaction, certain quantum numbers must be conserved: angular momentum, parity, and others like baryon number, but here spin and parity are the key ones.\n\nFirst, let's consider parity conservation. The total parity before the reaction should equal the total parity after the reaction. The initial state is π⁻ + d. The deuteron's parity is +1 (given as 1⁺, where the parity is the second part). The pion has intrinsic parity -1. But since the pion is captured from a p orbit, which has orbital angular momentum l=1. The parity of a state is given by the product of intrinsic parity and (-1)^l. So the parity of the pion's orbital state is (-1)^1 = -1. Therefore, the total initial parity is the product of the deuteron's parity, the pion's intrinsic parity, and the orbital parity: P_initial = P_d * P_π * (-1)^l = (+1) * (-1) * (-1)^1. Wait, hold on. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, the deuteron is in its own state, and the pion is in a p orbital (l=1) around the deuteron. So the total parity of the initial state is the product of the intrinsic parities of the deuteron and pion multiplied by (-1)^l from the orbital angular momentum. So P_initial = P_d * P_π * (-1)^l. Plugging in the values: P_d = +1, P_π = -1, l=1. So (-1)^1 = -1. Therefore, P_initial = (+1)*(-1)*(-1) = (+1)*(+1) = +1.\n\nNow, the final state is two neutrons. Each neutron has intrinsic parity +1 (since parity is a multiplicative quantum number, and for fermions, the intrinsic parity is +1 for particles and -1 for antiparticles; neutrons are particles, so +1). The total parity of the final state is the product of the intrinsic parities of the two neutrons multiplied by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum between them. So P_final = (+1)*(+1)*(-1)^L = (-1)^L. For parity to be conserved, P_initial = P_final. Since P_initial is +1, then (-1)^L must be +1, which implies that L is even (0, 2, 4,...). So the orbital angular momentum between the two neutrons must be even.\n\nNext, let's consider angular momentum conservation. The total angular momentum (J) before the reaction must equal the total angular momentum after. The initial angular momentum comes from the deuteron's spin (which is 1), the pion's spin (0), and the orbital angular momentum (l=1) between the pion and deuteron. So the total initial angular momentum is the vector sum of the deuteron's spin (1) and the orbital angular momentum (1). The possible total angular momenta here are J_initial = 1 (deuteron spin) ⊕ 1 (orbital l) → which can be 0, 1, or 2. But since the pion has spin 0, the total initial angular momentum is just the sum of deuteron's spin and the orbital angular momentum. However, in such reactions, we need to consider how the capture happens. The pion is captured into the nucleus, so the orbital angular momentum contributes to the total angular momentum of the system before the reaction.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to consider that the initial total angular momentum is the sum of the deuteron's spin (J_d=1) and the orbital angular momentum (l=1) of the pion relative to the deuteron. So the initial angular momentum can be J_initial = J_d + l, which can be 1 + 1, leading to possible values of 0, 1, 2. However, since the pion has spin 0, the total spin of the initial state is just the deuteron's spin plus the orbital angular momentum. But when the pion is captured, the reaction's angular momentum must be conserved. So the total angular momentum before (J_initial) must equal the total angular momentum after (J_final).\n\nThe final state is two neutrons. Each neutron has spin 1/2, so their spins can combine to either a singlet (S=0) or triplet (S=1) state. The total angular momentum J_final is then the sum of their spin (S=0 or 1) and the orbital angular momentum (L) between them. But earlier, we found that L must be even. So J_final = S ⊕ L. But since the initial J_initial can be 0, 1, or 2, we need to see which combinations of S and L can match that.\n\nBut wait, the initial J_initial is the vector sum of J_d=1 and l=1. Let's compute the possible values. Adding two angular momenta of 1 and 1 gives possible total angular momenta of 0, 1, 2. So J_initial can be 0, 1, or 2. The final state's total angular momentum must be equal to one of these. Let's consider possible cases.\n\nCase 1: J_initial = 0. Then J_final must be 0. The final state's J_final is S + L. Since L is even (0, 2, ...), and S is 0 or 1. If S=0 and L=0, then J_final=0. If S=1 and L=1 (but L must be even, so L=1 is not allowed). So the only possibility here is S=0 and L=0. But L must be even, so L=0 is allowed. Then J_final=0+0=0. So this is possible.\n\nCase 2: J_initial=1. Then J_final must be 1. Let's see. If S=0, then L must be 1 (but L must be even, so no). If S=1, then L could be 0 (even), leading to J_final=1+0=1. But L=0 is allowed (even). So S=1 and L=0 gives J_final=1. Alternatively, S=1 and L=2 (even), then J_final could be 1 + 2 = possible values from |1-2| to 1+2, i.e., 1, 2, 3. But J_final needs to be 1, so possible if L=2 and combining with S=1 to get J=1. But that's more complicated. However, since L must be even, the possible L values are 0, 2, etc. So for J_final=1, possible combinations could be S=1 and L=0 (J=1), or S=1 and L=2 with some coupling to get J=1. But the simplest is S=1, L=0. However, L=0 is allowed (even). So in this case, if J_initial=1, then J_final=1 can be achieved with S=1 and L=0. But wait, L=0 is even (since 0 is even), so that's okay. So this is possible.\n\nCase 3: J_initial=2. Then J_final must be 2. Possible combinations: S=0 and L=2 (since L must be even). Then J_final=0 + 2 = 2. Alternatively, S=1 and L=1 (but L must be even, so no). Or S=1 and L=3 (no, L must be even). Alternatively, S=1 and L=2. Then combining S=1 and L=2 can give J=1+2=3, 1+2-1=2, etc. So possible J=2. So if S=1 and L=2, then J_final could be 2. So that's possible.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the two neutrons must be in a singlet state. So S=0. Let's see if that's the only possibility. Let's check for each possible J_initial (0,1,2) whether S=0 is required.\n\nIf J_initial=0: Then J_final=0. If S=0, then L=0 (since J_final = S + L = 0 + 0 = 0). This is allowed because L=0 is even. If S=1, then L would have to be 1 to get J_final=0 (since 1 + 1 can give 0, but L must be even, so L=1 is not allowed). So only S=0 is possible here.\n\nIf J_initial=1: Then J_final=1. If S=0, then L must be 1 (J_final=1), but L must be even. So not allowed. If S=1, then L=0 (even) gives J_final=1. So possible. So here, S=1 is allowed.\n\nIf J_initial=2: Then J_final=2. If S=0, then L=2 (even) gives J_final=2. If S=1, then L=2 can combine to give J=2 (as one of the possible values). So both S=0 and S=1 are possible here.\n\nBut the problem states that the two neutrons must be in a singlet state (S=0). So why can't they be in triplet (S=1) for J_initial=1 or 2?\n\nWait, perhaps there's another constraint. Let's think about the Pauli exclusion principle. The neutrons are identical fermions, so their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. The total wavefunction is the product of spatial (orbital) wavefunction and spin wavefunction. So, if the spin state is symmetric (triplet, S=1), then the spatial wavefunction must be antisymmetric, which would require L to be odd. Conversely, if the spin state is antisymmetric (singlet, S=0), the spatial wavefunction must be symmetric, requiring L to be even.\n\nBut earlier, we found that parity conservation requires L to be even. Because P_final = (-1)^L = +1, so L must be even. Therefore, the spatial wavefunction is symmetric (since for even L, the parity is +1, which for spatial wavefunction, the parity is (-1)^L, so even L gives symmetric under exchange? Wait, actually, the spatial wavefunction's symmetry under exchange depends on L. Exchanging the two neutrons is equivalent to swapping their positions, which in their center-of-mass frame is equivalent to reversing the spatial coordinates, which introduces a factor of (-1)^L. So the spatial wavefunction is symmetric if (-1)^L = +1 (even L) and antisymmetric if (-1)^L = -1 (odd L). Therefore, since L must be even (from parity conservation), the spatial wavefunction is symmetric. Therefore, the spin wavefunction must be antisymmetric (to make the total wavefunction antisymmetric). The spin singlet state (S=0) is antisymmetric under exchange, while the triplet (S=1) is symmetric. Therefore, since the spatial part is symmetric (even L), the spin part must be antisymmetric, which is the singlet state. Therefore, the two neutrons must be in a singlet state.\n\nAh, that's the key point! The Pauli exclusion principle requires the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric. Since the spatial part is symmetric (because L is even), the spin part must be antisymmetric, which is the singlet state (S=0). Therefore, regardless of the initial angular momentum, the final state must have the neutrons in a singlet spin state.\n\nSo putting it all together: parity conservation requires L even, which makes the spatial wavefunction symmetric. Pauli exclusion then requires the spin wavefunction to be antisymmetric, which is the singlet state. Therefore, the two neutrons must be in a singlet state.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the spin state of the two neutrons in the reaction \\(\\pi^- + d \\rightarrow n + n\\), we analyze conservation laws and the Pauli exclusion principle:\n\n1. **Parity Conservation**:  \n   - Initial parity: \\(P_{\\text{initial}} = P_d \\cdot P_{\\pi} \\cdot (-1)^l = (+1) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-1)^1 = +1\\).  \n   - Final parity: \\(P_{\\text{final}} = (-1)^L\\), where \\(L\\) is the orbital angular momentum between the neutrons.

{"id": "atomic/4-27", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these physics problems step by step. I need to find the answers for parts (a) to (d) related to the production and decay of the Z^0 boson. Let me start with part (a).\n\n**Part (a): Energy of the electron beam in a colliding beam facility**\n\nThe process here is electron-positron annihilation producing a Z^0 boson. In a colliding beam setup, both particles are moving towards each other with equal energy. Since the Z^0 is produced at rest (assuming head-on collision with equal and opposite momenta), the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame should be equal to the rest mass energy of the Z^0.\n\nThe rest mass energy of Z^0 is given as 92 GeV. In collider experiments, the CM energy is the sum of the energies of the two particles. But since electrons and positrons are being collided with equal energies, each beam must provide half of the required energy. Wait, but electrons and positrons have the same mass, so if they collide head-on with equal energy, the total energy in the CM frame would be the sum of their energies. However, the rest mass of the Z^0 is 92 GeV, so the CM energy must be at least 92 GeV. Therefore, each beam needs to have energy such that when combined, the total energy is 92 GeV. But wait, the total energy in the CM frame is the sum of their energies. Wait, no. The CM energy isn't just the sum of the beam energies. Let me recall the formula for CM energy.\n\nThe formula for the CM energy (s) in a collider where two particles with energies E1 and E2 and momenta p1 and p2 collide is:\n\ns = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2\n\nBut since they are colliding head-on, the momenta are opposite in direction. Let's assume the positron is moving in the positive direction and the electron in the negative. So, the total momentum in the lab frame (which is the collider frame here) would be p1 - p2. But if the collider is symmetric, meaning both beams have the same energy and opposite momentum, then p1 = -p2. Wait, but electrons and positrons have the same mass. If they are accelerated to the same energy, their momenta would be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Therefore, the total momentum in the lab frame would be zero. Hence, the CM frame is the lab frame here. Therefore, the total energy in the CM frame is the sum of the energies of the two beams. Since the Z^0 is produced at rest, the total energy must equal its rest mass energy. Therefore, each beam must have energy E such that 2E = M_Z c². But wait, the rest energy of the Z is 92 GeV. So, each beam needs to have 46 GeV? Wait, but electrons are being accelerated, so their rest mass is 0.511 MeV, which is negligible compared to GeV scales. So, maybe relativistic effects are important here.\n\nWait, but if the electron and positron are each accelerated to energy E, then their total energy is 2E. But the Z^0's rest mass is 92 GeV, so 2E = 92 GeV, so E = 46 GeV. But wait, that seems too straightforward. However, electrons are light particles, so their rest mass is much smaller than the beam energy. But when the beam energy is much larger than the rest mass, the kinetic energy is approximately equal to the total energy. Wait, but the total energy of each particle is E = gamma m_e c². If the rest mass is negligible, then E ≈ pc. But in the collider case, if the total energy is 2E_beam = M_Z c², then each beam must have E_beam = M_Z c² / 2. Since M_Z is 92 GeV/c², then E_beam = 46 GeV. But wait, the rest mass of the electron is 0.511 MeV, which is much smaller than 46 GeV, so the approximation E ≈ pc is valid here. Therefore, the required energy for each beam is 46 GeV. So part (a) answer is 46 GeV.\n\n**Part (b): Required e+ beam energy for fixed target facility**\n\nNow, in a fixed target scenario, the positron beam is hitting electrons at rest. We need to find the beam energy required for the positron such that the total CM energy is equal to the Z^0 mass, 92 GeV. \n\nIn fixed target experiments, the target particles (electrons here) are at rest. The positron has energy E_beam. The total energy in the lab frame is E_lab = E_beam + m_e c² (since target electron is at rest, its energy is its rest mass). The total momentum is p_beam = gamma m_e v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor of the positron.\n\nThe CM energy squared is given by s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. We need s = (M_Z c²)^2.\n\nSo, let's compute s:\n\ns = (E_beam + m_e c²)^2 - (p_beam c)^2\n\nBut p_beam c = sqrt(E_beam^2 - (m_e c²)^2) because for the positron, E² = (pc)² + (m_e c²)².\n\nTherefore,\n\ns = (E_beam + m_e c²)^2 - (E_beam^2 - (m_e c²)^2)\n\nExpanding the first term:\n\n= E_beam² + 2 E_beam m_e c² + (m_e c²)^2 - E_beam² + (m_e c²)^2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 2 E_beam m_e c² + 2 (m_e c²)^2\n\nSet this equal to (M_Z c²)^2:\n\n2 E_beam m_e c² + 2 (m_e c²)^2 = (M_Z c²)^2\n\nDivide both sides by 2 (m_e c²)^2:\n\n(E_beam)/(m_e c²) + 1 = (M_Z c²)^2 / (2 (m_e c²)^2 )\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLet’s denote m_e c² as 0.511 MeV. M_Z is 92 GeV = 92000 MeV.\n\nSo,\n\n(E_beam / 0.511 MeV) + 1 = (92000 MeV)^2 / (2*(0.511 MeV)^2 )\n\nCompute the right-hand side:\n\n(92,000)^2 / (2*(0.511)^2) ≈ (8.464e9) / (2*0.261) ≈ 8.464e9 / 0.522 ≈ 1.621e10\n\nTherefore,\n\nE_beam / 0.511 MeV ≈ 1.621e10 - 1 ≈ 1.621e10 (since 1 is negligible)\n\nThus,\n\nE_beam ≈ 1.621e10 * 0.511 MeV ≈ 8.28e9 MeV ≈ 8.28e3 GeV ≈ 8280 GeV\n\nWait, that's 8.28 TeV. That seems extremely high. But given that in fixed target experiments, the required energy is much higher than in collider experiments, this makes sense. Because when the target is at rest, most of the energy goes into the CM frame, so the beam energy needs to be enormous. So part (b) answer is approximately 8.28 TeV. But let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, let's redo the equation:\n\ns = (E_beam + m_e c²)^2 - (p_beam c)^2 = (M_Z c²)^2\n\nBut p_beam c = sqrt(E_beam^2 - (m_e c²)^2 )\n\nSo,\n\ns = (E_beam + m_e c²)^2 - (E_beam^2 - (m_e c²)^2 )\n\n= E_beam² + 2 E_beam m_e c² + m_e² c^4 - E_beam² + m_e² c^4\n\n= 2 E_beam m_e c² + 2 m_e² c^4\n\nSet equal to (M_Z c²)^2:\n\n2 E_beam m_e c² + 2 m_e² c^4 = M_Z² c^4\n\nDivide both sides by 2 c^4:\n\nE_beam m_e + m_e² = (M_Z²)/2\n\nThen,\n\nE_beam = (M_Z²/(2 m_e)) - m_e\n\nBut since M_Z >> m_e, the term m_e is negligible. So,\n\nE_beam ≈ M_Z²/(2 m_e)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nM_Z = 92 GeV/c², m_e = 0.511 MeV/c² = 0.000511 GeV/c²\n\nThus,\n\nE_beam ≈ (92^2) / (2 * 0.000511) GeV\n\nCompute 92^2 = 8464\n\nSo,\n\nE_beam ≈ 8464 / (2 * 0.000511) ≈ 8464 / 0.001022 ≈ 8,280,000 GeV ≈ 8.28e6 GeV = 8.28 TeV\n\nYes, that's correct. So part (b) requires a positron beam energy of approximately 8.28 TeV. That's a huge energy, which is why colliders are more efficient for high-energy particle production.\n\n**Part (c): Energy and velocity of the Z^0 in the lab frame (fixed target case)**\n\nIn the fixed target scenario, after the e+ collides with the e- at rest, the Z^0 is produced. We need to find its energy and velocity in the lab frame.\n\nIn the lab frame, before collision, the total energy is E_total = E_beam + m_e c² (since target electron is at rest). The total momentum is p_total = p_beam = sqrt(E_beam² - m_e² c^4)/c.\n\nAfter the collision, the Z^0 is produced, and assuming it's the only product (since we're considering the reaction e+ + e- → Z^0), the Z^0 will carry the total energy and momentum of the system. Therefore, the energy of the Z^0 in the lab frame is E_Z = E_total = E_beam + m_e c², and its momentum p_Z = p_beam.\n\nBut wait, the Z^0 is a massive particle, so its energy is related to its momentum and mass by E_Z² = (p_Z c)^2 + (M_Z c²)^2.\n\nBut according to conservation of energy and momentum, yes, the Z^0 must have E_Z = E_beam + m_e c² and p_Z = p_beam.\n\nBut let's verify this. Since the target electron is at rest, the initial momentum is all from the positron beam. After collision, the Z^0 must carry that momentum. So yes, p_Z = p_beam. Then, the energy of the Z^0 is E_Z = sqrt( (p_Z c)^2 + (M_Z c²)^2 )\n\nBut according to conservation of energy, E_Z should be equal to E_beam + m_e c². Let's check if these are consistent.\n\nFrom part (b), we had:\n\ns = (M_Z c²)^2 = 2 E_beam m_e c² + 2 m_e² c^4\n\nBut s is also equal to (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2, which equals (E_beam + m_e c²)^2 - (p_beam c)^2. But we already used that to find E_beam. So, once E_beam is known, the Z^0's energy is E_total = E_beam + m_e c², and its momentum is p_beam.\n\nBut since E_beam is so large (8.28 TeV), m_e c² is negligible (0.511 MeV), so E_Z ≈ E_beam. Similarly, p_beam ≈ E_beam / c (since for high-energy particles, E ≈ pc). Therefore, p_Z c ≈ E_beam. Then, the energy of the Z^0 is E_Z ≈ E_beam, and its rest mass energy is M_Z c² = 92 GeV. But how does this reconcile?\n\nWait, there's a contradiction here. If the Z^0 has energy E_Z ≈ E_beam (which is 8.28 TeV) and rest mass 92 GeV, then its gamma factor would be E_Z / (M_Z c²) ≈ 8.28e3 GeV / 92 GeV ≈ 90. So gamma ≈ 90. Then, the velocity beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) ≈ 1 - 1/(2 gamma²) ≈ very close to c. But let's compute it properly.\n\nAlternatively, since E_Z = gamma M_Z c², and p_Z = gamma beta M_Z c.\n\nBut we also have E_Z = E_beam + m_e c² ≈ E_beam, and p_Z = p_beam ≈ E_beam / c.\n\nSo,\n\ngamma M_Z c² ≈ E_beam\n\ngamma beta M_Z c ≈ E_beam / c\n\nDividing the two equations:\n\n(gamma M_Z c²) / (gamma beta M_Z c) ) ≈ (E_beam) / (E_beam / c )\n\n=> (c) / (beta c) ) ≈ c\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me approach it differently.\n\nWe have E_Z = sqrt( (p_Z c)^2 + (M_Z c²)^2 )\n\nBut p_Z = p_beam = sqrt(E_beam^2 - m_e^2 c^4)/c ≈ E_beam / c (since E_beam >> m_e c²)\n\nSo,\n\nE_Z ≈ sqrt( (E_beam)^2 + (M_Z c²)^2 )\n\nBut from conservation of energy, E_Z = E_beam + m_e c² ≈ E_beam. Therefore,\n\nE_beam ≈ sqrt( E_beam^2 + (M_Z c²)^2 )\n\nBut this can't be true unless M_Z c² = 0, which it's not. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the fixed target case, the Z^0 is produced with some energy and momentum. The total energy and momentum of the system before collision (positron energy + electron rest energy, and positron momentum) must equal the energy and momentum of the Z^0 after collision.\n\nTherefore, E_Z = E_beam + m_e c²\n\np_Z = p_beam = sqrt(E_beam^2 - m_e^2 c^4)/c\n\nBut then, using the energy-momentum relation for the Z^0:\n\nE_Z^2 = (p_Z c)^2 + (M_Z c²)^2\n\nSubstituting E_Z and p_Z:\n\n(E_beam + m_e c²)^2 = (sqrt(E_beam^2 - m_e^2 c^4))^2 + (M_Z c²)^2\n\nSimplify left side: E_beam^2 + 2 E_beam m_e c² + m_e^2 c^4\n\nRight side: E_beam^2 - m_e^2 c^4 + M_Z^2 c^4\n\nSet equal:\n\nE_beam^2 + 2 E_beam m_e c² + m_e^2 c^4 = E_beam^2 - m_e^2 c^4 + M_Z^2 c^4\n\nCancel E_beam^2 on both sides:\n\n2 E_beam m_e c² + m_e^2 c^4 = - m_e^2 c^4 + M_Z^2 c^4\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n2 E_beam m_e c² + m_e^2 c^4 + m_e^2 c^4 - M_Z^2 c^4 = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2 E_beam m_e c² + 2 m_e^2 c^4 - M_Z^2 c^4 = 0\n\nDivide by c^4:\n\n2 E_beam m_e + 2 m_e^2 - M_Z^2 = 0\n\nWhich is the same equation as in part (b), leading to E_beam = (M_Z^2 - 2 m_e^2)/(2 m_e) ≈ M_Z^2/(2 m_e). So this is consistent.\n\nTherefore, once we have E_beam, the energy of the Z^0 is E_Z = E_beam + m_e c² ≈ E_beam (since E_beam is 8.28 TeV and m_e c² is 0.511 MeV, negligible). The momentum of the Z^0 is p_Z = sqrt(E_beam^2 - m_e^2 c^4)/c ≈ E_beam / c.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the Z^0 is approximately 8.28 TeV + 0.511 MeV ≈ 8.28 TeV. The velocity can be found from beta = (p_Z c)/E_Z. Since p_Z c ≈ E_beam, and E_Z ≈ E_beam, then beta ≈ 1. But more precisely:\n\nbeta = (p_Z c) / E_Z\n\nBut p_Z c = sqrt(E_beam^2 - m_e^2 c^4) ≈ E_beam (since E_beam >> m_e c²)\n\nE_Z = E_beam + m_e c² ≈ E_beam\n\nTherefore, beta ≈ E_beam / E_beam = 1. But to get a more precise value, let's compute:\n\nbeta = (sqrt(E_beam^2 - m_e^2 c^4)) / (E_beam + m_e c²)\n\nApproximate denominator as E_beam, numerator as E_beam sqrt(1 - (m_e c² / E_beam)^2) ≈ E_beam (1 - (m_e^2 c^4)/(2 E_beam^2))\n\nTherefore,\n\nbeta ≈ [E_beam (1 - (m_e^2 c^4)/(2 E_beam^2))] / E_beam = 1 - (m_e^2 c^4)/(2 E_beam^2)\n\nGiven that E_beam is 8.28e3 GeV = 8.28e6 MeV, m_e c² = 0.511 MeV,\n\n(m_e c² / E_beam) = 0.511 / 8.28e6 ≈ 6.17e-8\n\nSo,\n\nbeta ≈ 1 - (6.17e-8)^2 / 2 ≈ 1 - (3.8e-15)/2 ≈ 1 - 1.9e-15 ≈ 1\n\nSo the velocity is extremely close to c. However, for the purposes of the problem, maybe we need to express it in terms of beta.\n\nAlternatively, using the exact formula:\n\nbeta = p_Z c / E_Z\n\np_Z c = sqrt(E_beam^2 - m_e^2 c^4) ≈ E_beam\n\nE_Z = E_beam + m_e c² ≈ E_beam\n\nThus, beta ≈ 1. But perhaps we can compute gamma first.\n\ngamma = E_Z / (M_Z c²) = (E_beam + m_e c²) / (M_Z c²) ≈ E_beam / M_Z c²\n\nE_beam is 8.28e3 GeV, M_Z is 92 GeV.\n\ngamma ≈ 8.28e3 / 92 ≈ 90\n\nThen, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/8100) ≈ 1 - 1/(2*8100) ≈ 0.999938\n\nSo beta ≈ 0.9999c. Therefore, the velocity is approximately 0.9999 times the speed of light.\n\nBut let's compute it more accurately.\n\ngamma = E_Z / (M_Z c²) = (8.28e3 GeV + 0.000511 GeV) / 92 GeV ≈ 8.28e3 / 92 ≈ 90\n\nSo gamma ≈ 90.\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = sqrt(1 - 1/8100) ≈ 1 - 1/(2*8100) ≈ 1 - 0.0000617 ≈ 0.9999383\n\nSo beta ≈ 0.99994, so velocity v ≈ 0.99994c.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the Z^0 is approximately 8.28 TeV, and its velocity is approximately 0.99994c.\n\nBut wait, the energy of the Z^0 in the lab frame is E_Z = E_beam + m_e c² ≈ 8.28 TeV + 0.511 MeV ≈ 8.28 TeV. So the energy is about 8.28 TeV, and velocity is approximately 0.99994c.\n\n**Part (d): Maximum energy in the lab frame of muons from Z^0 decay**\n\nThe Z^0 decays into mu+ and mu-. We need to find the maximum energy of the muons in the lab frame.\n\nThe maximum energy occurs when the muon is emitted in the direction of motion of the Z^0 (i.e., forward direction in the lab frame). To calculate this, we can consider the decay in the Z^0 rest frame and then boost to the lab frame.\n\nIn the Z^0 rest frame, the decay products (mu+ and mu-) are emitted isotropically. The maximum energy in the lab frame will occur when a muon is emitted in the same direction as the Z^0's motion. \n\nIn the Z^0 rest frame, each muon has energy E'_μ = M_Z / 2 (since the Z^0 is at rest, and the muons share the energy equally). The momentum of each muon in this frame is p'_μ = sqrt(E'_μ² - m_mu² c^4)/c. But since M_Z >> m_mu (muon mass is about 105.7 MeV), we can approximate E'_μ ≈ M_Z / 2 and p'_μ ≈ M_Z / (2c).\n\nWhen we boost to the lab frame (which is moving with velocity v relative to the Z^0 rest frame), the energy of the forward-going muon will be boosted. The Lorentz transformation for energy is:\n\nE_μ = gamma (E'_μ + beta p'_μ c)\n\nSince the muon is moving in the same direction as the boost (from Z^0 rest frame to lab frame), this will give the maximum energy.\n\nGiven that gamma ≈ 90 and beta ≈ 0.99994, let's compute this.\n\nFirst, in the Z^0 rest frame:\n\nE'_μ = M_Z / 2 = 92 GeV / 2 = 46 GeV\n\np'_μ c = sqrt( (46 GeV)^2 - (0.1057 GeV)^2 ) ≈ 46 GeV (since 0.1057 GeV is negligible compared to 46 GeV)\n\nTherefore, p'_μ c ≈ 46 GeV\n\nThen, the lab frame energy E_μ = gamma (E'_μ + beta p'_μ c )\n\n= gamma (46 GeV + beta * 46 GeV )\n\n= gamma * 46 GeV (1 + beta )\n\nSince beta ≈ 1, (1 + beta ) ≈ 2. So,\n\nE_μ ≈ gamma * 46 GeV * 2 ≈ 90 * 46 * 2 GeV ≈ 90 * 92 GeV ≈ 8280 GeV ≈ 8.28 TeV\n\nWait, that's the same as the Z^0's energy in the lab frame. But that can't be right, because the Z^0's energy is 8.28 TeV, and the muon can't have more energy than the Z^0. Wait, but the Z^0's energy is 8.28 TeV, and when it decays, the muons share that energy. However, in the lab frame, due to the boost, one muon can get almost all the energy, and the other very little.\n\nWait, let's think again. The Z^0 is moving with gamma ≈ 90. In its rest frame, each muon has energy 46 GeV. When we boost to the lab frame, the muon emitted in the direction of motion (forward) will have energy increased, while the one emitted backward will have energy decreased.\n\nThe maximum energy occurs when the muon is emitted in the forward direction. The energy in the lab frame is:\n\nE_μ = gamma (E'_μ + beta p'_μ c )\n\nBut since p'_μ c ≈ E'_μ (because m_mu << E'_μ), then:\n\nE_μ ≈ gamma (E'_μ + beta E'_μ ) = gamma E'_μ (1 + beta )\n\nWith gamma ≈ 90, beta ≈ 0.99994, E'_μ = 46 GeV,\n\nE_μ ≈ 90 * 46 GeV * (1 + 0.99994 ) ≈ 90 * 46 GeV * 1.99994 ≈ 90 * 46 * 2 GeV ≈ 90 * 92 GeV ≈ 8280 GeV ≈ 8.28 TeV\n\nBut the total energy of the Z^0 is 8.28 TeV, so how can one muon have all that energy? That seems impossible. Wait, but in reality, the muon can't have more energy than the Z^0. However, the Z^0's energy is 8.28 TeV, and when it decays, the total energy of the decay products must equal the Z^0's energy. So if one muon takes almost all the energy, the other must take very little. Let's check:\n\nIn the lab frame, the total energy of both muons should be equal to the Z^0's energy, which is 8.28 TeV. If one muon has 8.28 TeV, the other would have negligible energy. But according to the calculation, the forward muon has 8.28 TeV. That seems possible only if the other muon has zero energy, which isn't physical. But considering that in the Z^0 rest frame, the muons are emitted back-to-back with equal and opposite momenta. When boosted, the forward muon gets a huge energy, and the backward one gets a reduced energy.\n\nLet me compute it more accurately. Let's denote:\n\ngamma = 90\n\nbeta ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) ≈ 0.999938\n\nIn the Z^0 rest frame, mu+ has energy E'_μ = 46 GeV, momentum p'_μ c = 46 GeV (approximating m_mu = 0). Then, the Lorentz transformation for the forward muon (direction of boost):\n\nE_μ = gamma (E'_μ + beta p'_μ c )\n\n= gamma (46 + beta *46 )\n\n= gamma *46 (1 + beta )\n\nSimilarly, the backward muon (opposite direction):\n\nE_μ = gamma (E'_μ - beta p'_μ c )\n\n= gamma *46 (1 - beta )\n\nSo total energy:\n\nE_total = gamma *46 (1 + beta ) + gamma *46 (1 - beta ) = gamma *46 *2 = gamma *92 GeV\n\nBut gamma is 90, so total energy is 90*92 GeV = 8280 GeV = 8.28 TeV, which matches the Z^0's energy. Therefore, the forward muon has energy 8.28 TeV * (1 + beta )/2, and the backward one has 8.28 TeV * (1 - beta )/2. Wait, no:\n\nWait, E_μ_forward = gamma *46 (1 + beta )\n\nBut gamma = 90, and gamma *46 = 90*46 = 4140 GeV\n\nThen, (1 + beta ) ≈ 1 + 1 = 2 (since beta ≈ 1), so E_μ_forward ≈ 4140 * 2 = 8280 GeV = 8.28 TeV\n\nSimilarly, E_μ_backward ≈ 4140 * (1 - beta ) ≈ 4140 * (1 - 0.999938) ≈ 4140 * 0.000062 ≈ 0.257 GeV\n\nSo the forward muon gets almost all the energy, and the backward one gets about 0.257 GeV. Therefore, the maximum energy of a muon in the lab frame is 8.28 TeV.\n\nBut wait, the Z^0's energy is 8.28 TeV, so the muon can't have more than that. But according to this calculation, the forward muon has exactly the same energy as the Z^0. That seems contradictory. However, the total energy of both muons must equal the Z^0's energy. But in this case, the forward muon has 8.28 TeV and the backward one has 0.257 GeV, totaling approximately 8.28 TeV + 0.000257 TeV ≈ 8.28 TeV, which matches. Therefore, the maximum energy is indeed 8.28 TeV.\n\nBut wait, the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so even if it's moving at nearly the speed of light, its energy can't exceed the total energy of the system. But here, the system's total energy is 8.28 TeV, so the muon can indeed have up to that energy if the other muon has negligible energy. Therefore, the maximum energy of a muon in the lab frame is 8.28 TeV.\n\nBut let me check with more precise calculation. Let's not approximate m_mu = 0.\n\nIn the Z^0 rest frame, each muon has energy E'_μ = M_Z / 2 = 46 GeV. The momentum p'_μ = sqrt(E'_μ² - m_mu² ) / c. Let's compute p'_μ c:\n\nm_mu = 0.1057 GeV/c²\n\np'_μ c = sqrt( (46 GeV)^2 - (0.1057 GeV)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2116 - 0.01117) ≈ 46 GeV\n\nSo the approximation holds. Therefore, the previous calculation is valid.\n\nThus, the maximum energy of a muon in the lab frame is approximately 8.28 TeV.\n\n**Summary of Answers:**\n\n(a) In collider: Each beam energy = 46 GeV\n\n(b) Fixed target: e+ beam energy ≈ 8.28 TeV\n\n(c) Z^0 energy ≈ 8.28 TeV, velocity ≈ 0.99994c\n\n(d) Maximum muon energy ≈ 8.28 TeV\n\nBut let me verify part (d) again. The maximum energy occurs when the muon is emitted in the direction of the Z^0's motion. The boost from the Z^0 rest frame to lab frame adds energy. The formula used gives E_μ = gamma (E'_μ + beta p'_μ c ). Since E'_μ ≈ p'_μ c ≈ 46 GeV, then E_μ ≈ gamma (46 + beta *46 ) GeV ≈ gamma *46 (1 + beta ) GeV. With gamma ≈ 90 and beta ≈ 1, this is approximately 90*46*2 ≈ 8280 GeV = 8.28 TeV.

{"id": "atomic/4-42", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this problem where a negative Xi particle decays into a Lambda and a pion. The Xi is moving in the lab frame with a momentum of 2 GeV/c, and in the Xi's rest frame, the Lambda is emitted at 30 degrees from the original direction. I have to find the momenta and angles of both the Lambda and pion in the lab frame after the decay. Hmm, let's start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with particle decays, especially in different reference frames, Lorentz transformations are essential. Since the decay happens in the center-of-mass (CM) frame of the Xi, I need to first analyze the decay there and then boost the results back to the lab frame. The key steps probably involve calculating the energies and momenta of the decay products in the CM frame, then applying the Lorentz boost to get their lab frame momenta and angles.\n\nLet me recall the process. In the CM frame, the Xi is at rest, so its total momentum is zero. When it decays into Lambda and pion, their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. But the problem states that in the Xi's CM frame, the Lambda is emitted at 30 degrees from the initial direction. Wait, but in the CM frame, the initial direction is the direction the Xi was moving in the lab frame, right? So in the CM frame, the decay products can have any direction, but their momenta vectors should sum to zero. Wait, no, in the CM frame, the total momentum is zero, so the Lambda and pion must have opposite momenta. So if the Lambda is at 30 degrees, the pion must be at 180 + 30 = 210 degrees? Because their momenta vectors need to cancel each other out. So their magnitudes must be equal, but directions opposite. But wait, maybe not exactly opposite in angle if their masses are different. Wait, no, in the CM frame, the total momentum is zero, so the vector sum of the two decay products' momenta must be zero. Therefore, their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So if the Lambda is moving at 30 degrees, the pion must be moving at 30 + 180 = 210 degrees. But their magnitudes must be the same. But wait, their rest masses are different, so their energies would be different, but their momenta vectors must be opposite. So the magnitudes of their momenta must be equal. Hmm, but how does that work with different masses? Because in the CM frame, the decay products have to have equal and opposite momenta. So their energies would be different because their masses are different. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, in the CM frame, the two decay products must have equal and opposite momenta. So |p_Λ| = |p_π| in the CM frame. But their energies would be different because E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². So even though their momenta are equal in magnitude, their energies differ. That makes sense.\n\nSo first, I need to calculate the energies and momenta of Lambda and pion in the CM frame. Then, apply a Lorentz boost from the CM frame (which is moving with velocity v relative to the lab frame) to the lab frame. The lab frame is where the Xi has momentum 2 GeV/c. Wait, but the Xi's rest frame is moving relative to the lab frame. So the boost would be from the Xi's rest frame (CM frame) to the lab frame. The direction of the boost is along the x-axis, since the Xi is moving along the positive x-direction in the lab.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find the velocity of the Xi in the lab frame. Since the Xi has momentum p = 2 GeV/c, and its rest mass is M_Ξ c² = 1.3 GeV. So the energy of the Xi in the lab frame is E_Ξ = sqrt( (p_Ξ c)^2 + (M_Ξ c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, units can be tricky here. Let me check.\n\nWait, momentum p is given in GeV/c. So p_Ξ c = 2 GeV. Then, the energy E_Ξ is sqrt( (p_Ξ c)^2 + (M_Ξ c²)^2 ) = sqrt( (2 GeV)^2 + (1.3 GeV)^2 ) = sqrt(4 + 1.69) GeV = sqrt(5.69) GeV ≈ 2.385 GeV. So E_Ξ ≈ 2.385 GeV. Then, the velocity beta (β) of the Xi in the lab frame is (p_Ξ c²) / E_Ξ. Since β = v/c = (pc)/E. So β_Ξ = (2 GeV/c * c) / (2.385 GeV) ) = (2 GeV) / (2.385 GeV) ≈ 0.838. So β ≈ 0.838, and gamma factor γ_Ξ = E_Ξ / (M_Ξ c²) = 2.385 GeV / 1.3 GeV ≈ 1.835.\n\nSo the Xi is moving with β ≈ 0.838 and γ ≈ 1.835 in the lab frame.\n\n2. Now, in the Xi's rest frame (CM frame), the decay products Λ and π^- have momenta equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let's denote the magnitude as p'. The angle given is 30 degrees for the Λ, so the pion is at 210 degrees (i.e., opposite direction). But since the problem says \"the angle of 30° from the initial Ξ^- direction\", which in the CM frame, the initial direction is the direction the Xi was moving in the lab, which is the positive x-direction. So in the CM frame, the Λ is moving at 30 degrees above the x-axis, and the pion is moving at 210 degrees (i.e., 30 degrees below the negative x-axis). But since the problem is in 3D, but likely we can consider it in 2D, x and y components.\n\nWait, but in the CM frame, the total momentum is zero, so the momenta of Λ and π must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So if the Λ is at 30 degrees, the pion must be at 30 + 180 = 210 degrees. So their momentum vectors are p'_Λ and p'_π = -p'_Λ. So their magnitudes are equal, directions opposite.\n\nBut how do we find the magnitude p'? Since in the CM frame, the decay must conserve energy and momentum. Wait, but in the CM frame, the initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the momenta of Λ and π must be equal and opposite. So their magnitudes are equal. So we can use conservation of energy in the CM frame. The total energy in the CM frame is equal to the rest energy of the Xi, which is M_Ξ c² = 1.3 GeV. So the sum of the energies of Λ and π must be 1.3 GeV.\n\nSo E'_Λ + E'_π = M_Ξ c² = 1.3 GeV.\n\nBut E'_Λ = sqrt( (p' c)^2 + (M_Λ c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, units again. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, energy E is in GeV. The rest energy is M_Λ c² = 1.1 GeV. So E'_Λ = sqrt( (p' c)^2 + (M_Λ c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no. Let's think in terms of units. If p' is in GeV/c, then p' c is in GeV. Then, (p' c)^2 is (GeV)^2, and (M_Λ c²)^2 is (1.1 GeV)^2. So E'_Λ = sqrt( (p' c)^2 + (M_Λ c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no. Wait, E in terms of momentum and mass is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ). So E'_Λ = sqrt( (p'_Λ c)^2 + (M_Λ c²)^2 ). Similarly for E'_π.\n\nBut since p'_Λ = p'_π = p', because their magnitudes are equal. So:\n\nE'_Λ = sqrt( (p' c)^2 + (1.1 GeV)^2 )\n\nE'_π = sqrt( (p' c)^2 + (0.14 GeV)^2 )\n\nAnd E'_Λ + E'_π = 1.3 GeV.\n\nSo we can set up the equation:\n\nsqrt( (p' c)^2 + (1.1)^2 ) + sqrt( (p' c)^2 + (0.14)^2 ) = 1.3\n\nLet me denote x = p' c in GeV. Then:\n\nsqrt(x² + 1.21) + sqrt(x² + 0.0196) = 1.3\n\nThis is an equation in x. Let's solve for x.\n\nLet me call the first term A = sqrt(x² + 1.21), second term B = sqrt(x² + 0.0196). So A + B = 1.3.\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\n(A + B)^2 = 1.69\n\nA² + 2AB + B² = 1.69\n\nBut A² = x² + 1.21, B² = x² + 0.0196. So:\n\n(x² + 1.21) + 2AB + (x² + 0.0196) = 1.69\n\nCombine terms:\n\n2x² + 1.21 + 0.0196 + 2AB = 1.69\n\n2x² + 1.2296 + 2AB = 1.69\n\n2x² + 2AB = 1.69 - 1.2296 = 0.4604\n\nx² + AB = 0.2302\n\nBut AB = sqrt(x² + 1.21) * sqrt(x² + 0.0196)\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe another approach. Let's subtract the two equations. Let me rearrange the original equation:\n\nsqrt(x² + 1.21) = 1.3 - sqrt(x² + 0.0196)\n\nNow square both sides:\n\nx² + 1.21 = (1.3)^2 - 2*1.3*sqrt(x² + 0.0196) + x² + 0.0196\n\nSimplify:\n\nLeft side: x² + 1.21\n\nRight side: 1.69 - 2.6 sqrt(x² + 0.0196) + x² + 0.0196\n\nSubtract x² from both sides:\n\n1.21 = 1.69 + 0.0196 - 2.6 sqrt(x² + 0.0196)\n\n1.21 = 1.7096 - 2.6 sqrt(x² + 0.0196)\n\nSubtract 1.7096:\n\n1.21 - 1.7096 = -2.6 sqrt(x² + 0.0196)\n\n-0.4996 = -2.6 sqrt(x² + 0.0196)\n\nDivide both sides by -2.6:\n\n0.4996 / 2.6 ≈ 0.19215 = sqrt(x² + 0.0196)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n0.19215² ≈ 0.0369 = x² + 0.0196\n\nSo x² = 0.0369 - 0.0196 = 0.0173\n\nx ≈ sqrt(0.0173) ≈ 0.1315 GeV\n\nSo p' c ≈ 0.1315 GeV, so p' = 0.1315 GeV / c ≈ 0.1315 GeV/c\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again. Let me verify the steps.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\nsqrt(x² + 1.21) + sqrt(x² + 0.0196) = 1.3\n\nLet me plug x ≈ 0.1315 GeV into the left side:\n\nsqrt(0.0173 + 1.21) + sqrt(0.0173 + 0.0196) = sqrt(1.2273) + sqrt(0.0369) ≈ 1.108 + 0.192 ≈ 1.3, which matches. So x ≈ 0.1315 GeV. Therefore, p' = x / c ≈ 0.1315 GeV/c. Wait, but p' is already in GeV/c, since x = p' c. So p' = x / c = (0.1315 GeV) / c. Wait, no. Wait, x is p' c, so p' = x / c. But x is in GeV, so p' is in GeV / c. So p' = 0.1315 GeV/c. So the magnitude of the momentum of each particle in the CM frame is approximately 0.1315 GeV/c.\n\nSo in the CM frame, the Λ has momentum p'_Λ = 0.1315 GeV/c at 30 degrees, and the pion has p'_π = 0.1315 GeV/c at 210 degrees.\n\nNow, to find their momenta in the lab frame, we need to perform a Lorentz boost from the CM frame (Xi rest frame) to the lab frame. The boost is along the x-axis, since the Xi is moving along the x-direction in the lab. The velocity of the boost is the same as the velocity of the Xi in the lab frame, which we calculated earlier as β ≈ 0.838, and γ ≈ 1.835.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation for momentum components from the CM frame (primed) to the lab frame (unprimed) is:\n\np_x = γ (p'_x + β E' / c)\np_y = p'_y\np_z = p'_z\n\nSince we're dealing with a 2D problem (x and y), p_z components are zero. So we can ignore them.\n\nThe energy in the CM frame for each particle is E'_Λ and E'_π. Let's compute those.\n\nFor the Λ:\n\nE'_Λ = sqrt( (p'_Λ c)^2 + (M_Λ c²)^2 ) = sqrt( (0.1315 GeV)^2 + (1.1 GeV)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.0173 + 1.21) GeV ≈ sqrt(1.2273) ≈ 1.108 GeV.\n\nSimilarly, for the pion:\n\nE'_π = sqrt( (0.1315 GeV)^2 + (0.14 GeV)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.0173 + 0.0196) GeV ≈ sqrt(0.0369) ≈ 0.192 GeV.\n\nNow, let's compute the components for each particle.\n\nFirst, the Λ:\n\nIn the CM frame, its momentum components are:\n\np'_Λx = p'_Λ cos(30°) = 0.1315 GeV/c * cos(30°) ≈ 0.1315 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.1139 GeV/c\n\np'_Λy = p'_Λ sin(30°) = 0.1315 GeV/c * 0.5 ≈ 0.06575 GeV/c\n\nThen, applying the Lorentz transformation:\n\np_Λx = γ (p'_Λx + β E'_Λ / c )\n\nBut E'_Λ is in GeV, and β is unitless, γ is unitless. Let's check units:\n\nE'_Λ / c has units of GeV / (m/s) * s/m ? Wait, no. Wait, E'_Λ is in GeV, which is energy. To get E'_Λ / c in units of GeV s/m, but momentum is GeV/c. Hmm, perhaps better to keep track in natural units where c=1. Let's switch to natural units where c=1, so that energy and mass are in GeV, momentum in GeV/c, but c=1, so E (GeV) = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 ) / c^2 → but in natural units, c=1, so E = sqrt( p^2 + m^2 ). Wait, maybe this is complicating. Alternatively, since we have E'_Λ in GeV, and p'_Λx in GeV/c, and β is v/c, which is unitless.\n\nWait, let's see. The term β E'_Λ / c would be (unitless) * (GeV) / (m/s) → but perhaps we need to convert units properly. Alternatively, since in the Lorentz transformation, the formula is:\n\np_x = γ (p'_x + β E' / c² )\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the correct Lorentz transformation for momentum.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation for momentum and energy between frames moving along the x-axis with velocity v (beta = v/c, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²)) is:\n\np_x = gamma (p'_x + beta E' / c )\np_y = p'_y\np_z = p'_z\nE = gamma (E' + beta c p'_x )\n\nWait, yes, that's correct. Because the transformation equations are:\n\np_parallel = gamma (p'_parallel + beta E' / c )\np_perp = p'_perp / gamma (but wait, no, if the boost is along x, then y and z components are divided by gamma(1 - beta v_x / c ), but I think in standard Lorentz transformations, the perpendicular components are not changed if the boost is along x. Wait, no, actually, the correct transformations when boosting from the primed (CM) frame to the unprimed (lab) frame moving at velocity v along the x-axis relative to the primed frame are:\n\np_x = gamma (p'_x + beta E' / c )\np_y = p'_y / gamma (1 - beta v'_x / c )\nWait, no, perhaps better to refer to standard formulas. Let me recall.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation for momentum components when boosting from frame S' to S (S' moving at velocity v along x relative to S) is:\n\np_x = gamma (p'_x + (v / c^2) E' )\np_y = p'_y / gamma (1 - (v p'_x ) / (E' + gamma m c^2) ) )\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, since we have the energy and momentum in the CM frame, perhaps it's easier to use the Lorentz transformation for four-momentum. The four-momentum in the CM frame is (E'_Λ / c, p'_Λx, p'_Λy, 0). Then, applying a boost along the x-axis with velocity v (beta = v/c), the transformed four-momentum in the lab frame is:\n\nE_lab = gamma (E'_Λ + beta c p'_Λx )\np_labx = gamma (p'_Λx + beta E'_Λ / c )\np_laby = p'_Λy\np_labz = 0\n\nSimilarly for the pion.\n\nYes, this seems correct. Because the Lorentz boost along x affects the x-component of momentum and the energy, while the y-component remains the same (divided by gamma(1 - beta v_x / c ), but since in the CM frame, the original frame is moving at velocity -v relative to the lab, so the boost is velocity v. Wait, maybe better to use the standard formula.\n\nAlternatively, using the transformation:\n\nIn the S' frame (CM frame), the particle has energy E' and momentum (p'_x, p'_y, p'_z). The lab frame S is moving with velocity v along the x-axis relative to S'. Then, the energy and momentum in S are:\n\nE = gamma (E' + v p'_x )\np_x = gamma (p'_x + v E' / c² )\np_y = p'_y / gamma (1 + v p'_x / (E' + gamma m c^2) ) )\n\nWait, this is getting too involved. Maybe better to use the standard Lorentz transformation for four-vectors. The four-momentum is (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z). The boost matrix along x is:\n\n| gamma  -gamma beta  0  0 |\n| -gamma beta  gamma  0  0 |\n| 0       0     1    0 |\n| 0       0     0    1 |\n\nWait, no. Wait, the Lorentz transformation matrix for a boost in the x-direction with velocity v (beta = v/c, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²)) is:\n\nFor the four-vector (ct, x, y, z), the transformation is:\n\nct' = gamma (ct - beta x)\nx' = gamma (x - beta ct)\ny' = y\nz' = z\n\nBut for the four-momentum (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z), the transformation would be similar:\n\nE/c' = gamma (E/c - beta p_x )\np'_x = gamma (p_x - beta E/c )\np'_y = p_y\np'_z = p_z\n\nBut since we are going from the CM frame (S') to the lab frame (S), which is moving at velocity v = beta c in the +x direction relative to S', the inverse transformation would be:\n\nE/c = gamma (E'/c + beta p'_x )\np_x = gamma (p'_x + beta E'/c )\np_y = p'_y\np_z = p'_z\n\nYes, that's correct. So the lab frame energy and momentum are:\n\nE = gamma (E' + beta c p'_x )\np_x = gamma (p'_x + beta E' / c )\np_y = p'_y\np_z = p'_z\n\nSo for each particle, we can compute their lab frame momentum components using these equations.\n\nGiven that, let's compute for the Λ first.\n\nFor the Λ in CM frame:\n\nE'_Λ = 1.108 GeV\np'_Λx = 0.1139 GeV/c\np'_Λy = 0.06575 GeV/c\n\nBeta is 0.838, gamma is 1.835.\n\nSo E_lab_Λ = gamma (E'_Λ + beta c p'_Λx )\n\nBut beta c = v, and since p'_Λx is in GeV/c, multiplying by beta c gives:\n\nbeta c * p'_Λx = (0.838) * c * (0.1139 GeV/c) = 0.838 * 0.1139 GeV ≈ 0.0954 GeV\n\nSo E_lab_Λ = 1.835 * (1.108 GeV + 0.0954 GeV) ≈ 1.835 * 1.2034 ≈ 2.208 GeV\n\nSimilarly, p_x_Λ = gamma (p'_Λx + beta E'_Λ / c )\n\nBut beta E'_Λ / c = (0.838) * (1.108 GeV) / c. Wait, units again. Let's see:\n\nE'_Λ is in GeV, which is energy. So E'_Λ / c has units of GeV / (m/s) * s/m ? Hmm, perhaps better to note that in natural units where c=1, E'_Λ is in GeV, p'_x is in GeV/c, but when c=1, p'_x is in GeV. But here, we need to be careful with units.\n\nWait, let's express everything in terms of GeV and GeV/c.\n\nbeta is 0.838, gamma is 1.835.\n\np'_Λx is 0.1139 GeV/c.\n\nE'_Λ is 1.108 GeV.\n\nSo beta E'_Λ / c = 0.838 * 1.108 GeV / c. But GeV/c is a unit of momentum. So if we multiply GeV by (GeV/c)^{-1}, we get c^{-1}. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, since c=1 in natural units, but here we have to keep track. Let's use the fact that 1 GeV/c ≈ 5.36e-19 kg·m/s. But maybe it's better to treat the units symbolically.\n\nThe term beta E'_Λ / c has units of (unitless) * (GeV) / (m/s) * s/m ? Not sure. Alternatively, since beta = v/c, so beta E'_Λ / c = (v/c) * E'_Λ / c = v E'_Λ / c². But in terms of momentum, p = gamma m v, so maybe there's a relation. But perhaps it's easier to just compute numerically.\n\nWait, let's compute p_x_Λ:\n\np_x_Λ = gamma (p'_Λx + beta E'_Λ / c )\n\nBut p'_Λx is in GeV/c, and E'_Λ is in GeV. So beta E'_Λ / c is (0.838) * (1.108 GeV) / c. But GeV/c is a unit of momentum. So 1 GeV/c is equal to (1e9 eV) / (3e8 m/s) ) * (1.602e-19 C·V) / (1 eV) ) → but perhaps converting GeV/c to kg·m/s is not necessary here. Let's just treat the units symbolically.\n\nSo, p'_Λx is 0.1139 GeV/c.\n\nbeta E'_Λ / c = 0.838 * 1.108 GeV / c = (0.838 * 1.108) GeV/c ≈ 0.928 GeV/c.\n\nWait, no. Wait, beta is unitless, E'_Λ is in GeV, and c is in m/s. So beta E'_Λ / c would have units of GeV·s/m. But p'_Λx is in GeV/c, which is GeV·s/m. So they have the same units. Therefore, adding them is okay.\n\nSo:\n\np'_Λx + beta E'_Λ / c = 0.1139 GeV/c + 0.838 * 1.108 GeV / c ≈ 0.1139 + 0.928 ≈ 1.0419 GeV/c\n\nThen multiply by gamma (1.835):\n\np_x_Λ ≈ 1.835 * 1.0419 ≈ 1.911 GeV/c\n\nSimilarly, p_y_Λ = p'_Λy = 0.06575 GeV/c\n\nSo the Λ in the lab frame has momentum components (1.911 GeV/c, 0.06575 GeV/c). The magnitude of its momentum is sqrt( (1.911)^2 + (0.06575)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(3.652 + 0.0043) ≈ sqrt(3.656) ≈ 1.912 GeV/c. The angle theta_Λ with respect to the x-axis is arctan(p_y / p_x) = arctan(0.06575 / 1.911) ≈ arctan(0.0344) ≈ 1.97 degrees.\n\nWait, but that seems very small. The Λ in the lab frame is moving mostly along the x-axis, with a slight y-component. But in the CM frame, it was emitted at 30 degrees. But after the boost, the angle is reduced. That makes sense because the boost along the x-axis adds a lot of x-component momentum.\n\nNow, let's compute the pion's momentum in the lab frame.\n\nFor the pion in the CM frame:\n\nE'_π = 0.192 GeV\np'_πx = p'_π cos(210°) = 0.1315 GeV/c * cos(210°) = 0.1315 * (-√3/2) ≈ 0.1315 * (-0.8660) ≈ -0.1139 GeV/c\np'_πy = p'_π sin(210°) = 0.1315 GeV/c * (-0.5) ≈ -0.06575 GeV/c\n\nApplying the Lorentz transformation:\n\nE_lab_π = gamma (E'_π + beta c p'_πx )\n\nAgain, beta c p'_πx = 0.838 * c * (-0.1139 GeV/c) = -0.838 * 0.1139 GeV ≈ -0.0954 GeV\n\nSo E_lab_π = 1.835 * (0.192 GeV - 0.0954 GeV) ≈ 1.835 * 0.0966 ≈ 0.177 GeV\n\np_x_π = gamma (p'_πx + beta E'_π / c )\n\np'_πx = -0.1139 GeV/c\n\nbeta E'_π / c = 0.838 * 0.192 GeV / c ≈ 0.838 * 0.192 ≈ 0.161 GeV/c\n\nSo p'_πx + beta E'_π / c = -0.1139 + 0.161 ≈ 0.0471 GeV/c\n\nMultiply by gamma:\n\np_x_π ≈ 1.835 * 0.0471 ≈ 0.0865 GeV/c\n\np_y_π = p'_πy = -0.06575 GeV/c\n\nSo the pion's momentum components are (0.0865 GeV/c, -0.06575 GeV/c). The magnitude is sqrt(0.0865² + (-0.06575)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.00748 + 0.00432) ≈ sqrt(0.0118) ≈ 0.1086 GeV/c. The angle theta_π is arctan(p_y / p_x) = arctan(-0.06575 / 0.0865) ≈ arctan(-0.76) ≈ -37.3 degrees. But since the x-component is positive and y-component is negative, the angle is below the x-axis, so approximately 37.3 degrees below the x-axis.\n\nWait, but let's check the calculations again for accuracy.\n\nFor the pion's p_x:\n\np'_πx = -0.1139 GeV/c\n\nbeta E'_π / c = 0.838 * 0.192 GeV / c ≈ 0.161 GeV/c\n\nSo sum is -0.1139 + 0.161 = 0.0471 GeV/c\n\nMultiply by gamma 1.835: 0.0471 * 1.835 ≈ 0.0865 GeV/c. Correct.\n\np_y_π = -0.06575 GeV/c. Correct.\n\nSo the pion's momentum in the lab frame is (0.0865, -0.06575) GeV/c, magnitude ≈ 0.1086 GeV/c, angle ≈ -37.3 degrees.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the momenta and angles of both particles in the lab. So we need to present their magnitudes and angles.\n\nBut let's check if the total momentum in the lab frame is equal to the original Xi momentum of 2 GeV/c. The total momentum should be the sum of the Λ and pion momenta in the lab.\n\nTotal p_x = 1.911 + 0.0865 ≈ 1.9975 GeV/c ≈ 2 GeV/c, which matches the initial Xi momentum (2 GeV/c). The total p_y = 0.06575 - 0.06575 = 0. So that's good, conservation of momentum.\n\nSo the results make sense.\n\nTherefore, the Λ has momentum ≈ 1.912 GeV/c at ≈ 1.97 degrees above the x-axis, and the pion has momentum ≈ 0.1086 GeV/c at ≈ 37.3 degrees below the x-axis.\n\nBut let's compute the angles more precisely.\n\nFor the Λ:\n\ntheta_Λ = arctan(p_y / p_x) = arctan(0.06575 / 1.911) ≈ arctan(0.0344) ≈ 1.97 degrees.\n\nFor the pion:\n\ntheta_π = arctan(-0.06575 / 0.0865) ≈ arctan(-0.76) ≈ -37.3 degrees, which is 37.3 degrees below the x-axis.\n\nBut the problem might expect the angles as measured from the initial Ξ direction (positive x-axis), so for the pion, the angle is 360 - 37.3 = 322.7 degrees, but typically angles are reported between -180 and 180 or 0 and 360. Alternatively, since it's below the x-axis, it's 37.3 degrees in the negative y direction, so the angle is -37.3 degrees or equivalently 322.7 degrees. But in physics, angles are often given as measured from the x-axis, increasing counterclockwise, so the pion's angle is 360 - 37.3 = 322.7 degrees, but it's more common to state it as -37.3 degrees if allowed.\n\nBut let's confirm the exact values with more precise calculations.\n\nFirst, precise calculation for the Λ's angle:\n\np_y_Λ = 0.06575 GeV/c\n\np_x_Λ = 1.911 GeV/c\n\ntan(theta_Λ) = 0.06575 / 1.911 ≈ 0.0344\n\ntheta_Λ ≈ arctan(0.0344) ≈ 1.97 degrees.\n\nFor the pion:\n\np_y_π = -0.06575 GeV/c\n\np_x_π = 0.0865 GeV/c\n\ntan(theta_π) = -0.06575 / 0.0865 ≈ -0.76\n\ntheta_π ≈ arctan(-0.76) ≈ -37.3 degrees.\n\nSo the angles are approximately 1.97 degrees above the x-axis for the Λ, and 37.3 degrees below the x-axis for the pion.\n\nBut let's check if we did the Lorentz transformations correctly. Let me verify the pion's energy and momentum.\n\nE_lab_π = gamma (E'_π + beta c p'_πx )\n\nE'_π = 0.192 GeV\n\nbeta c p'_πx = 0.838 * c * (-0.1139 GeV/c) = -0.838 * 0.1139 GeV ≈ -0.0954 GeV\n\nSo E_lab_π = 1.835 * (0.192 - 0.0954) ≈ 1.835 * 0.0966 ≈ 0.177 GeV. Correct.\n\np_x_π = gamma (p'_πx + beta E'_π / c )\n\np'_πx = -0.1139 GeV/c\n\nbeta E'_π / c = 0.838 * 0.192 GeV / c ≈ 0.161 GeV/c\n\nSo p_x_π = 1.835 * (-0.1139 + 0.161) ≈ 1.835 * 0.0471 ≈ 0.0865 GeV/c. Correct.\n\np_y_π remains -0.06575 GeV/c.\n\nSo the calculations seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\nLambda in lab: momentum ≈ 1.91 GeV/c at ≈ 2.0 degrees above x-axis.\n\nPion in lab: momentum ≈ 0.109 GeV/c at ≈ 37.3 degrees below x-axis.\n\nBut let's present more precise values.\n\nFirst, let's recalculate the Λ's momentum magnitude:\n\nsqrt( (1.911)^2 + (0.06575)^2 ) = sqrt(3.652 + 0.00432) = sqrt(3.6563) ≈ 1.912 GeV/c.\n\nSimilarly, the pion's momentum magnitude:\n\nsqrt(0.0865^2 + (-0.06575)^2) = sqrt(0.00748 + 0.00432) = sqrt(0.0118) ≈ 0.1086 GeV/c.\n\nFor the angles:\n\nLambda's angle: arctan(0.06575 / 1.911) ≈ arctan(0.0344) ≈ 1.97 degrees.\n\nPion's angle: arctan(-0.06575 / 0.0865) ≈ arctan(-0.76) ≈ -37.3 degrees.\n\nBut let's use more precise values for the components.\n\nFor the Λ:\n\np_x_Λ = 1.911 GeV/c (from earlier calculation: 1.835 * 1.0419 ≈ 1.911)\n\nBut let's compute 1.835 * 1.0419 precisely:\n\n1.835 * 1.0419 = 1.835 * 1 + 1.835 * 0.0419 ≈ 1.835 + 0.0769 ≈ 1.9119 GeV/c.\n\np_y_Λ = 0.06575 GeV/c.\n\nSo theta_Λ = arctan(0.06575 / 1.9119) ≈ arctan(0.0344) ≈ 1.972 degrees.\n\nFor the pion:\n\np_x_π = 0.0865 GeV/c.\n\np_y_π = -0.06575 GeV/c.\n\ntheta_π = arctan(-0.06575 / 0.0865) ≈ arctan(-0.76) ≈ -37.3 degrees.\n\nBut let's compute this more accurately.\n\n-0.06575 / 0.0865 ≈ -0.76.\n\narctan(-0.76): Let's compute this. tan(37 degrees) ≈ 0.7536, tan(37.5) ≈ 0.7673. So -0.76 is between -37 and -37.5 degrees. Let's interpolate.\n\nDifference between 37 and 37.5 degrees:\n\nAt 37 degrees: tan ≈ 0.7536\n\nAt 37.5 degrees: tan ≈ 0.7673\n\nThe value 0.76 is 0.76 - 0.7536 = 0.0064 above 37 degrees.\n\nThe difference between 37.5 and 37 degrees is 0.0137 in tan.\n\nSo fraction: 0.0064 / 0.0137 ≈ 0.467.\n\nSo angle ≈ 37 +", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0}
{"id": "atomic/3-52", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The question is about how the spin vector **s** and linear momentum **p** transform under the parity operator **P** and the time reversal operator **T**. \n\nStarting with the parity operator, **P**. Parity is a spatial inversion, which means it changes the sign of spatial coordinates. So, under parity, position vectors **r** become -**r**. Momentum **p** is related to velocity, which is the time derivative of position. Since velocity **v** = d**r**/dt, under parity, **v** becomes -**v** because **r** becomes -**r** and the derivative doesn't affect the sign. Therefore, momentum **p** = m**v** should also change sign under parity. So, **P** transforms **p** to -**p**.\n\nNow, spin **s** is an angular momentum vector, which is the cross product of position and momentum, **L** = **r** × **p**. Under parity, **r** → -**r** and **p** → -**p**, so **L** becomes (-**r**) × (-**p**) = **r** × **p** = **L**. Therefore, angular momentum vectors like spin are pseudovectors (axial vectors) because they don't change sign under parity. So, **s** should remain the same under **P**. Wait, but spin is an intrinsic angular momentum. Does that affect anything? Hmm, maybe spin behaves the same way as orbital angular momentum under parity. So, yes, **s** → **s** under **P**.\n\nNow, time reversal operator **T**. Time reversal reverses the direction of time, t → -t. Under time reversal, velocities and momenta reverse direction because velocity is d**r**/dt, so if dt becomes -dt, velocity becomes -**v**. Therefore, momentum **p** = m**v** also reverses direction. So, **T** transforms **p** to -**p**.\n\nWhat about spin? Spin is related to angular momentum, which is **r** × **p**. Under time reversal, **r** stays the same (since position doesn't depend on the direction of time), but **p** becomes -**p**. Therefore, **L** = **r** × **p** becomes **r** × (-**p**) = -**L**. So, angular momentum, including spin, should reverse direction under time reversal. Hence, **s** → -**s** under **T**.\n\nWait, but spin is also associated with magnetic moments, which might have different transformation properties. But in general, for time reversal, angular momentum (which is a generator of rotations) should change sign because angular momentum is related to rotational motion, and reversing time would reverse the direction of rotation. So yes, spin should flip under **T**.\n\nSo summarizing part (a):\n\nUnder parity **P**:\n- **s** → **s** (since it's a pseudovector)\n- **p** → -**p** (polar vector)\n\nUnder time reversal **T**:\n- **s** → -**s** (since angular momentum changes sign)\n- **p** → -**p** (momentum reverses direction)\n\nWait, but wait, under time reversal, momentum **p** is a time derivative of position. If time is reversed, velocity becomes negative, so **p** becomes -**p**. So that's correct. Spin, being angular momentum, also reverses. So that's correct.\n\nSo part (a) answers:\n\nFor parity:\n**P** **s** **P**⁻¹ = **s**\n**P** **p** **P**⁻¹ = -**p**\n\nFor time reversal:\n**T** **s** **T**⁻¹ = -**s**\n**T** **p** **T**⁻¹ = -**p**\n\nBut wait, operators acting on quantum states. The transformation of operators under symmetry operations can be written as:\n\nFor parity, which is unitary (I think), so **P** **s** **P**† = **s**\nSimilarly, **P** **p** **P**† = -**p**\n\nFor time reversal, which is antiunitary, so **T** **s** **T**⁻¹ = -**s**\n**T** **p** **T**⁻¹ = -**p**\n\nBut maybe the question just wants the transformation properties, not the operator action. So the answer is:\n\nUnder parity:\n**s** → **s**\n**p** → -**p**\n\nUnder time reversal:\n**s** → -**s**\n**p** → -**p**\n\nThat's part (a).\n\nNow part (b): Suggest a way to look for time reversal violation in the decay Λ → N + π. Are any experimental details or assumptions crucial?\n\nTime reversal symmetry implies that the process and its time-reversed version should have the same probabilities. If there's a violation, we can observe some asymmetry that can't be explained without T-violation.\n\nIn the decay Λ → N + π, we need to find an observable that is odd under T. Since under T, spin and momentum both reverse. So, possible observables could be correlations between spin and momenta.\n\nFor example, consider the decay products' momenta and the spin of the Λ particle. If the Λ has a spin, and when it decays, the decay products have some angular correlation that depends on the spin direction. If T is violated, there might be a term in the decay amplitude that is T-odd, leading to a measurable asymmetry.\n\nA classic way to look for T violation is to look for a triple product correlation. For example, **s_Λ · (p_N × p_π)**. Let's see how this transforms under T.\n\nUnder T: **s_Λ** → -**s_Λ**, **p_N** → -**p_N**, **p_π** → -**p_π**. So the cross product **p_N × p_π** under T becomes (-**p_N**) × (-**p_π**) = **p_N × p_π**. Then the dot product with **s_Λ** becomes (-**s_Λ**) · (**p_N × p_π**) = - (**s_Λ · (p_N × p_π)**). So this triple product is T-odd. If the expectation value of this quantity is non-zero, it would indicate T violation, because under T symmetry, such an expectation value should be zero.\n\nBut wait, in reality, even without T violation, certain final state interactions (like strong or electromagnetic phases) can mimic such a signal. However, for a process where final state interactions are negligible or can be accounted for, a non-zero expectation value of a T-odd observable would indicate T violation.\n\nIn the decay Λ → N + π, the Λ is a spin-1/2 particle. Suppose we measure the polarization of the Λ (its spin direction) and the momenta of the decay products (proton and pion, assuming N is a nucleon like proton or neutron). Then, constructing the triple product **s_Λ · (p_N × p_π)**. If this has a non-zero average value, that would suggest T violation.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that under parity, how does this triple product transform? Let's check. Under parity: **s_Λ** → **s_Λ**, **p_N** → -**p_N**, **p_π** → -**p_π**. So **p_N × p_π** becomes (-**p_N**) × (-**p_π**) = **p_N × p_π**. Then **s_Λ · (p_N × p_π)** → **s_Λ · (p_N × p_π)**. So this quantity is a pseudoscalar under parity (since it's a scalar but parity even). Wait, no: parity transforms the momenta, but the cross product of two vectors under parity (which inverts each vector) would be (**p_N** × **p_π**) → (-**p_N**) × (-**p_π**) = **p_N × p_π**, so the cross product is a pseudovector. Then the dot product with **s_Λ** (which is a pseudovector) gives a scalar. Wait, **s_Λ** is a pseudovector (axial vector), so **s_Λ · (p_N × p_π)** is a scalar. But under parity, since **s_Λ** is a pseudovector and **p_N × p_π** is a pseudovector, their dot product is a scalar. Wait, pseudovector · pseudovector is a scalar. But under parity, each pseudovector remains the same, so the scalar would be even under parity. So the triple product is a scalar that is even under parity. But under time reversal, it's odd. So if the expectation value of this scalar is non-zero, it would be a T-odd effect. However, in the presence of final state interactions (which can introduce phases), even with T-invariance, such a term can be non-zero. Therefore, to claim T violation, one needs to ensure that there are no strong phases contributing to this observable, or that the strong phases are accounted for. But in weak decays, which are supposed to violate T, but in practice, observing such a correlation could be a signal. However, in the Standard Model, T violation is related to CP violation via the CPT theorem. So if the process is CP-violating, then under CPT, it would imply T violation. But in the decay Λ → N + π, which is a weak decay (since Λ is a hyperon decaying via the weak force), there could be CP violation. However, to isolate T violation, one might need to compare with the CP-conjugate process. But perhaps in this case, since the question is about suggesting a way to look for T violation, the triple product correlation is the way to go. But the key point is that a non-zero expectation value of a T-odd observable would indicate T violation, provided that there are no other T-even contributions that can mimic it. The experimental details would involve measuring the spin of the Λ and the momenta of the decay products. The assumptions would be that there are no significant final state interactions (like rescattering) that could produce a non-zero T-odd correlation even in a T-symmetric theory. Alternatively, if such interactions are present, their effects must be calculable and subtracted. Another assumption might be that the detection apparatus doesn't introduce any biases that mimic the T-odd effect. Also, one needs to have a way to measure the initial spin polarization of the Λ, which could be done by producing Λ hyperons in a polarized state, perhaps through a production mechanism that imparts polarization. For example, in proton-proton collisions or fixed-target experiments where the Λ is produced with a certain polarization. So the suggestion is to measure the expectation value of the triple product **s_Λ · (p_N × p_π)**. If it's non-zero, that's evidence of T violation. But the crucial experimental details are the ability to measure the Λ's spin polarization and the momenta of the decay products accurately. The assumptions include the absence of significant final state interactions that could mimic the T-violating effect, or the ability to account for them. Also, the experiment must ensure that the measurement isn't biased by the experimental setup, which could introduce artificial asymmetries. Another point is that in practice, since T violation is related to CP violation via CPT symmetry, one might need to compare the process with its CP-conjugate to confirm T violation. But the question is about directly looking for T violation, so the triple product is the key. So the answer for part (b) is to look for a non-zero expectation value of the triple product of the Λ spin with the cross product of the nucleon and pion momenta. The experimental details include measuring the Λ's polarization and the momenta, and assumptions involve the absence of significant final state interactions that could produce a T-odd correlation without genuine T violation.\n</think>\n\n(a) Under the parity operator \\( \\hat{P} \\) and time reversal operator \\( \\hat{T} \\), the transformations of spin \\( \\mathbf{s} \\) and linear momentum \\( \\mathbf{p} \\) are:\n\n- **Parity \\( \\hat{P} \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{s} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{s}, \\quad \\mathbf{p} \\rightarrow -\\mathbf{p}.\n  \\]\n  Spin \\( \\mathbf{s} \\) is a pseudovector (invariant under parity), while momentum \\( \\mathbf{p} \\) is a polar vector (changes sign).\n\n- **Time reversal \\( \\hat{T} \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{s} \\rightarrow -\\mathbf{s}, \\quad \\mathbf{p} \\rightarrow -\\mathbf{p}.\n  \\]\n  Both spin and momentum reverse direction under time reversal.\n\n(b) To search for time reversal (T) violation in \\( \\Lambda \\rightarrow N + \\pi \\), measure the **triple product correlation** \\( \\mathbf{s}_\\Lambda \\cdot (\\mathbf{p}_N \\times \\mathbf{p}_\\pi) \\).

{"id": "atomic/4-19", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the rest mass of the new particle formed when a moving particle collides and combines with a stationary one. Both have the same rest mass, m. The moving particle has kinetic energy twice its rest energy. Hmm.\n\nFirst, rest energy is mc². So kinetic energy (KE) is 2mc². But wait, total energy of the moving particle would be rest energy plus kinetic energy, so that's mc² + 2mc² = 3mc². Right?\n\nNow, in relativity, the total energy and momentum are conserved. The problem is about combining two particles into one, so it's a perfectly inelastic collision. The key here is to use conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nLet me recall that for a particle moving with velocity v, the total energy is γmc² and momentum is γmv. Since the second particle is at rest, its momentum is zero, and energy is just its rest energy, mc².\n\nSo before collision, the total energy is the energy of the moving particle plus the energy of the stationary one: 3mc² + mc² = 4mc². Wait, no. Wait, the moving particle's KE is 2mc², so its total energy is KE + rest energy = 2mc² + mc² = 3mc². The stationary particle's energy is just mc². So total energy before collision is 3mc² + mc² = 4mc². That's correct.\n\nNow, momentum. The moving particle's momentum is γmv. But since KE is 2mc², and KE = (γ - 1)mc², so (γ - 1)mc² = 2mc² → γ - 1 = 2 → γ = 3. So γ is 3. Therefore, the momentum p = γmv = 3mv. But I need to express this in terms of m and c. Let's find v in terms of c.\n\nWe know that γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 3. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/3 → 1 - v²/c² = 1/9 → v²/c² = 8/9 → v = (2√2/3)c. Hmm, but maybe I don't need the velocity. Since γ is 3, then the momentum p = γmv = 3mv. But we can relate v to γ. Alternatively, use the relation between energy and momentum. For a relativistic particle, E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Since the moving particle's energy is 3mc², then (3mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)² → 9m²c⁴ = p²c² + m²c⁴ → p²c² = 8m²c⁴ → p = 2√2 m c / c²? Wait, no. Let's solve for p:\n\nE² = (pc)² + (mc²)² → (3mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)² → 9m²c⁴ = p²c² + m²c⁴ → p²c² = 8m²c⁴ → p² = 8m²c² → p = 2√2 m c. Wait, units? Momentum should be kg·m/s. If m is in kg, c in m/s, then p is kg·m/s. So p = 2√2 m c. That seems right.\n\nSo the total momentum before collision is just the momentum of the moving particle, which is 2√2 m c. The stationary particle has zero momentum.\n\nAfter collision, the combined particle has rest mass M, and since it's moving (because the initial momentum was non-zero), its total energy is γ' M c² and momentum is γ' M v', where γ' is the Lorentz factor for the new particle's velocity v'.\n\nBut since momentum must be conserved, the total momentum after collision is γ' M v' = 2√2 m c. And total energy after collision is γ' M c² = 4 m c² (from before, total energy before collision was 4mc²).\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1. γ' M v' = 2√2 m c\n\n2. γ' M c² = 4 m c²\n\nLet me divide the first equation by the second to eliminate γ' M. So:\n\n(γ' M v') / (γ' M c²) = (2√2 m c) / (4 m c²)\n\nSimplify left side: v' / c²\n\nRight side: (2√2 / 4) * (m c / m c²) → (√2 / 2) * (1 / c)\n\nWait, let me compute the right side step by step.\n\nNumerator: 2√2 m c\n\nDenominator: 4 m c²\n\nSo (2√2 m c) / (4 m c²) = (2√2 / 4) * (m / m) * (c / c²) = (√2 / 2) * (1 / c) = √2 / (2c)\n\nSo left side is v' / c², right side is √2 / (2c)\n\nTherefore:\n\nv' / c² = √2 / (2c) → Multiply both sides by c²:\n\nv' = (√2 / 2c) * c² = (√2 / 2) c = (c / √2) * √2 / √2? Wait, √2 / 2 is 1/√2. So v' = c / √2.\n\nSo velocity of the new particle is c / √2.\n\nNow, let's find γ' for this velocity. γ' = 1 / sqrt(1 - v'^2/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (1/2)) = 1 / sqrt(1/2) = sqrt(2).\n\nSo γ' = sqrt(2).\n\nNow, from equation 2: γ' M c² = 4 m c² → sqrt(2) M c² = 4 m c² → M = 4 m / sqrt(2) = 2√2 m.\n\nBut wait, the rest mass of the new particle is M, but when the particle is moving, its total energy is γ' M c². However, the rest mass is M, regardless of the motion. But in the conservation equations, the total energy after collision is the sum of the rest energies plus kinetic energy, but since they combine into a single particle, the rest mass M is such that when it's moving with velocity v', its total energy is γ' M c² and momentum γ' M v'. But the rest mass is M. So the answer is M = 4 m / sqrt(2) = 2√2 m. But let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the invariant quantity: the total energy squared minus (total momentum times c)^2 should be equal to (M c²)^2.\n\nBecause in any frame, the invariant mass squared is (ΣE)^2 - (Σp c)^2.\n\nSo before collision, total energy is 4mc², total momentum is 2√2 m c.\n\nSo invariant mass squared is (4mc²)^2 - (2√2 m c * c)^2 = 16 m²c⁴ - (8 m²c² * c²) = 16m²c⁴ - 8m²c⁴ = 8m²c⁴. Therefore, invariant mass is sqrt(8m²c⁴) = 2√2 m c² / c²? Wait, no. Wait, invariant mass squared is (Mc²)^2 = 8m²c⁴ → Mc² = sqrt(8) m c² → M = sqrt(8) m = 2√2 m. So that's the same result. Therefore, the rest mass of the new particle is 2√2 m.\n\nSo the answer should be 2√2 times m. Let me confirm again.\n\nYes, using the invariant mass approach is perhaps simpler. The total energy is 4mc², total momentum is 2√2 mc. Then, the invariant mass M is given by (E_total/c²)^2 - (p_total)^2 = M². So:\n\nE_total = 4mc², so E_total/c² = 4m.\n\np_total = 2√2 m c.\n\nSo (4m)^2 - (2√2 m c / c)^2 = M². Wait, units? Let me check:\n\nWait, E_total^2 = (4mc²)^2 = 16m²c⁴.\n\n(p_total c)^2 = (2√2 m c * c)^2 = (2√2 m c²)^2 = 8 m²c⁴.\n\nSo E_total^2 - (p_total c)^2 = 16m²c⁴ - 8m²c⁴ = 8m²c⁴ = (Mc²)^2 → Mc² = sqrt(8m²c⁴) = 2√2 m c² → M = 2√2 m.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the rest mass of the new particle is 2√2 m. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}m}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the rest mass \\( M \\) of the new particle formed in the collision, we use conservation of energy and momentum, along with relativistic invariants.\n\n1. **Energy Conservation**:\n   - The moving particle has kinetic energy \\( 2mc^2 \\), so its total energy is \\( 3mc^2 \\).\n   - The stationary particle's energy is \\( mc^2 \\).\n   - Total energy before collision: \\( 3mc^2 + mc^2 = 4mc^2 \\).\n\n2. **Momentum Conservation**:\n   - The moving particle's momentum is calculated using its total energy \\( 3mc^2 \\).

{"id": "atomic/4-26", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The question is asking for the reaction equation for the decay of a negative muon and to identify all the particles involved. Hmm, I remember that muons are part of the lepton family. The negative muon, which is a heavy cousin of the electron, decays via the weak interaction. The typical decay mode for a mu-minus (μ⁻) should involve producing an electron and some neutrinos. Wait, right, because in muon decay, the muon converts into a muon neutrino, and then there's an electron and an electron antineutrino to conserve lepton numbers. Let me recall the exact equation.\n\nSo, the muon (μ⁻) decays into an electron (e⁻), a muon antineutrino (ν̄_μ), and an electron neutrino (ν_e). Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me check the conservation laws. The muon has a lepton number of +1 for muons. When it decays, it should emit a muon neutrino to conserve the muon lepton number. Then, the electron has an electron lepton number of +1, so there must be an electron antineutrino to balance that? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, the standard decay equation for μ⁻ is: μ⁻ → e⁻ + ν̄_e + ν_μ. Let me verify. The muon (μ⁻) has a muon lepton number of +1. After decay, the electron (e⁻) has an electron lepton number of +1. To conserve the muon lepton number, we need a muon neutrino (ν_μ) with +1? Wait, no. Wait, the antineutrino would have a lepton number of -1. So if the muon decays, it's losing its muon lepton number. So to conserve the muon lepton number, we need a muon antineutrino (ν̄_μ) with -1, which would balance the original +1 from the muon. Then, for the electron side, the electron has +1 electron lepton number, so we need an electron antineutrino (ν̄_e) with -1 to balance that. Wait, but that would give total electron lepton number as +1 (from e⁻) plus -1 (from ν̄_e) equals zero. But the original total electron lepton number was zero. So that works. So the equation is μ⁻ → e⁻ + ν̄_e + ν_μ. Wait, but I think I might have mixed up the neutrinos. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's μ⁻ → e⁻ + ν̄_μ + ν_e. Wait, that would be: the muon (μ⁻) has muon lepton number +1. The decay products: e⁻ has electron lepton number +1. The ν̄_μ has muon lepton number -1, and ν_e has electron lepton number +1. Then total muon lepton number: -1 (from ν̄_μ) + original +1 (muon) would be 0? Wait, no. The original muon has +1. The decay products have ν̄_μ (-1) and the others don't contribute. So total muon lepton number would be -1, which doesn't balance. That can't be right. So maybe the correct equation is μ⁻ → e⁻ + ν̄_e + ν_μ. Let's check the lepton numbers:\n\nMuon lepton number: μ⁻ is +1. Decay products: ν_μ is +1 (since it's a muon neutrino), and ν̄_e is -1 (electron antineutrino). Wait, but the muon lepton number in decay products would be ν_μ's +1. Original was +1, so that's conserved. For electron lepton number: e⁻ is +1, ν̄_e is -1. Total electron lepton number is 0. But the original had 0. So that works. Wait, but then the total lepton numbers are conserved. So the equation is μ⁻ → e⁻ + ν̄_e + ν_μ. Yes, that seems correct. So the particles involved are the muon (μ⁻), electron (e⁻), electron antineutrino (ν̄_e), and muon neutrino (ν_μ).\n\nNow part (b): A mu-minus decays at rest. Could a lepton from this decay convert a proton at rest into a neutron? If so, how; and in particular will there be enough energy?\n\nFirst, let's think about the process where a lepton interacts with a proton to convert it into a neutron. That would involve a charged current interaction, probably. For example, in beta decay, a neutron converts into a proton, electron, and antineutrino: n → p + e⁻ + ν̄_e. The inverse process would be something like p + e⁻ → n + ν_e. But for that to happen, the electron needs to have enough energy to overcome the mass difference between the proton and neutron. Wait, but the proton is slightly lighter than the neutron. Wait, no: the neutron is heavier. Wait, the neutron mass is about 939.565 MeV/c², proton is about 938.272 MeV/c². So the neutron is heavier. Therefore, converting a proton into a neutron would require energy input. Because the neutron is more massive. So the reaction p → n would require energy. But in the process p + e⁻ → n + ν_e, the electron would need to provide enough energy to make up the mass difference plus any kinetic energy.\n\nWait, but the mass of the neutron is higher than the proton. So the rest mass of the proton plus the electron is 938.272 MeV + 0.511 MeV = 938.783 MeV. The neutron is 939.565 MeV. So the difference is about 0.782 MeV. So the electron would need to have enough kinetic energy to provide that 0.782 MeV. But electrons from muon decay at rest: what's their maximum energy?\n\nWhen a muon decays at rest, the electron gets a maximum energy when the neutrinos carry away minimal energy. The muon mass is about 105.7 MeV/c². The electron mass is 0.511 MeV/c². So the maximum electron energy would be when the two neutrinos are emitted in the same direction opposite to the electron, so that their momenta cancel out. The maximum energy can be calculated using the muon decay kinematics. The maximum electron energy is given by (m_mu² + m_e²)/(2 m_mu). Let me compute that. m_mu is 105.7 MeV, m_e is 0.511 MeV. So m_mu² is (105.7)^2 ≈ 11172.5 MeV². m_e² ≈ 0.261 MeV². So numerator is 11172.5 + 0.261 ≈ 11172.76. Divided by 2*105.7 ≈ 211.4. So 11172.76 / 211.4 ≈ 52.8 MeV. So the maximum electron energy is around 52.8 MeV. But wait, that's the maximum possible. The actual energy varies depending on the angles of the neutrinos. But the maximum possible energy the electron can have is about 52.8 MeV. Since the required energy to convert a proton to a neutron is about 0.782 MeV, which is much less than 52.8 MeV, then yes, the electron from the muon decay could have enough energy to cause the reaction p + e⁻ → n + ν_e.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the muon decays at rest. So the decay products (electron and neutrinos) must conserve momentum. Since the muon is at rest, the total momentum of the decay products must be zero. So the electron and the two neutrinos (ν̄_e and ν_μ) must have their momenta add up to zero. Therefore, the electron can't have all the energy; some energy must go into the neutrinos. But the maximum energy the electron can have is when the two neutrinos are emitted in the opposite direction to the electron, so their momenta balance. But even then, the electron's energy is around 52.8 MeV as calculated. So the electron's kinetic energy would be that minus its rest mass. Wait, the total energy of the electron is 52.8 MeV, which includes its rest mass. So the kinetic energy would be 52.8 - 0.511 ≈ 52.3 MeV. Which is way more than the 0.782 MeV needed. So even if the electron has maximum energy, which it can, then yes, there's enough energy. But wait, the reaction p + e⁻ → n + ν_e requires the electron to provide enough energy to make up the mass difference between proton and neutron. Let's compute the threshold energy.\n\nThe threshold energy for the reaction p + e⁻ → n + ν_e. The rest mass of the proton plus the electron is 938.272 + 0.511 = 938.783 MeV. The rest mass of the neutron is 939.565 MeV. The neutrino has negligible mass. So the energy required is 939.565 - 938.783 = 0.782 MeV. So the electron must have at least 0.782 MeV of kinetic energy to make this reaction possible. But the maximum kinetic energy of the electron from muon decay is about 52.3 MeV, which is way more than enough. Therefore, yes, the electron from the muon decay could convert a proton at rest into a neutron, provided that the electron's kinetic energy is at least 0.782 MeV. Since the maximum is much higher, and the average energy might be lower, but there's a spectrum. The maximum energy is sufficient, so in some cases, the electron will have enough energy. Therefore, the answer is yes, it's possible, and there is enough energy.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: could the antineutrino or the muon neutrino from the decay cause the proton to convert? Let's think. The other leptons are ν̄_e and ν_μ. Neutrinos can interact via the weak interaction. For example, the reaction p + ν̄_e → n + e⁺. Wait, that's a possible reaction. Let's check. The proton (p) plus an electron antineutrino (ν̄_e) could produce a neutron (n) and a positron (e⁺). The threshold energy for that reaction would be similar. Let's compute the threshold. The mass of the proton is 938.272 MeV, the antineutrino has negligible mass. The neutron is 939.565 MeV, and the positron is 0.511 MeV. So the total mass on the right is 939.565 + 0.511 = 940.076 MeV. The left side is 938.272 + 0 = 938.272. So the difference is 940.076 - 938.272 = 1.804 MeV. So the antineutrino would need to have at least 1.804 MeV of energy to make this reaction happen. But in the muon decay at rest, the antineutrino (ν̄_e) and the muon neutrino (ν_μ) share the energy. The total energy available in the decay is the muon mass, 105.7 MeV. The electron gets up to ~52.8 MeV, and the remaining energy is split between the two neutrinos. So each neutrino could have up to about (105.7 - 52.8)/2 ≈ 26.45 MeV. Wait, but actually, the energy distribution is more complex because it's a three-body decay. The maximum energy for any one neutrino would be when the other two particles are emitted in the opposite direction. But in any case, the neutrinos could have energies up to around half the muon mass, maybe. So 52.8 MeV for the electron, and the remaining ~52.9 MeV split between the two neutrinos. So each neutrino could have up to about 52.9 MeV. So the ν̄_e could have up to ~52.9 MeV, which is more than the 1.8 MeV needed for the reaction p + ν̄_e → n + e⁺. Therefore, the antineutrino could also convert a proton into a neutron, but via a different reaction. However, the question is asking if a lepton from the decay could convert a proton at rest into a neutron. The possible leptons are the electron, the electron antineutrino, and the muon neutrino. The muon neutrino (ν_μ) could interact via a different channel, like p + ν_μ → n + μ⁺, but the muon is much heavier (105.7 MeV), so the threshold energy would be much higher. Let's compute that. The mass of the proton is 938.272, the ν_μ has negligible mass. The neutron is 939.565, and the μ⁺ is 105.7 MeV. So the total mass on the right is 939.565 + 105.7 = 1045.265 MeV. The left side is 938.272. So the difference is 1045.265 - 938.272 ≈ 106.993 MeV. So the ν_μ would need at least 106.993 MeV of energy. But the maximum energy a ν_μ can have from the muon decay is about half of the remaining energy after the electron takes its maximum. Wait, the total energy available is the muon mass, 105.7 MeV. If the electron takes 52.8 MeV, then the remaining energy is 105.7 - 52.8 ≈ 52.9 MeV, which is split between the two neutrinos. So each neutrino could have up to 52.9 MeV, but that's not enough for the 107 MeV needed. Therefore, the muon neutrino cannot cause the proton to convert into a neutron via that channel. So the only possible leptons that could do this are the electron and the electron antineutrino.\n\nBut the question is, could a lepton from the decay convert a proton at rest into a neutron? So either the electron or the antineutrino. For the electron, the reaction is p + e⁻ → n + ν_e, which requires the electron to have at least 0.782 MeV kinetic energy. Since the maximum electron energy is ~52.8 MeV, which is more than enough, this is possible. For the antineutrino, the reaction p + ν̄_e → n + e⁺ requires the antineutrino to have at least 1.8 MeV. Since the antineutrino can have up to ~52.9 MeV, this is also possible. However, the question is asking if a lepton from the decay could do this. So both the electron and the antineutrino are leptons. Therefore, yes, either of them could convert a proton into a neutron, provided they have enough energy. But the problem states \"a lepton from this decay\" so either one. However, the answer might be focusing on the electron since it's the charged lepton, but the antineutrino is also a lepton. However, the conversion via the antineutrino would produce a neutron and a positron, but the question is about converting a proton into a neutron. So both reactions result in a neutron. Therefore, the answer is yes, either the electron or the electron antineutrino could cause the conversion, and there is enough energy.\n\nBut the question specifically says \"a lepton from this decay\". So the possible leptons are e⁻, ν̄_e, and ν_μ. The ν_μ can't do it because the energy required for its reaction is too high. The e⁻ and ν̄_e can. So the answer is yes, and the explanation should mention both possibilities. However, the problem might be expecting the answer to focus on the electron, as the antineutrino interaction is less likely due to the weak interaction's low cross-section, but the question is about possibility, not probability. So as long as the energy is sufficient, it's possible.\n\nTherefore, the answer to part (b) is yes, either the electron or the electron antineutrino from the decay could convert a proton into a neutron, and there is enough energy in both cases.\n</think>\n\n(a) The reaction equation for the decay of a negative muon (μ⁻) is:  \n\\[\n\\mu^- \\to e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e + \\nu_\\mu  \n\\]  \nThe particles involved are:  \n- **Negative muon (μ⁻)**: The decaying particle, a heavy lepton.  \n- **Electron (e⁻)**: A charged lepton produced in the decay.  \n- **Electron antineutrino (\\(\\bar{\\nu}_e\\))**: Neutral lepton carrying away electron lepton number.  \n- **Muon neutrino (\\(\\nu_\\mu\\))**: Neutral lepton conserving muon lepton number.  \n\n(b) **Yes**, a lepton from the decay could convert a proton at rest into a neutron.

{"id": "atomic/3-31", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. It's about the capture of a negative pion by a deuteron resulting in two neutrons. The questions are about angular momentum, spin, probability, and angular dependence. Let's start with part (a).\n\n**Part (a): Orbital Angular Momentum of the Neutron Pair**\n\nFirst, I need to recall conservation laws. Since this is a nuclear reaction, angular momentum should be conserved. The initial state consists of a π⁻ meson and a deuteron. The final state is two neutrons. Let's break down the angular momenta.\n\nThe π⁻ meson is a pseudoscalar particle, which means it has spin 0 (since pseudoscalar corresponds to spin 0 and parity -1). The deuteron is in the ^3S₁ state. The notation ^3S₁ tells me that the deuteron has spin S=1 (triplet state), orbital angular momentum L=0 (S-state), and total angular momentum J=1. So the deuteron's total angular momentum is 1ħ.\n\nThe initial total angular momentum is the sum of the deuteron's angular momentum and the π⁻'s angular momentum. Since the π⁻ has spin 0, its contribution comes only from its orbital angular momentum relative to the deuteron. The problem states that the π⁻ is in the lowest-energy Coulomb wave function, which is an S-wave (L=0). So the initial orbital angular momentum between π⁻ and deuteron is zero. Therefore, the total initial angular momentum is just the deuteron's spin, which is J=1.\n\nNow, the reaction converts this into two neutrons. The final state has two neutrons, so their total angular momentum must also be J=1 (conservation of angular momentum). The total angular momentum of the two neutrons is the sum of their spins (each neutron has spin 1/2) plus their orbital angular momentum relative to each other.\n\nLet's denote the orbital angular momentum of the neutron pair as L. The total spin S of the two neutrons can be either S=1 (triplet) or S=0 (singlet). But since neutrons are identical fermions, their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. The total wavefunction is a product of spatial (orbital) and spin parts. For the spatial part, the orbital angular momentum L determines the symmetry: even L is symmetric (since the spatial wavefunction under exchange would pick up a factor (-1)^L), and the spin part must then be antisymmetric if L is even, or symmetric if L is odd.\n\nBut wait, neutrons are fermions, so the total wavefunction (spin × orbital) must be antisymmetric. So if the orbital part is symmetric (even L), the spin part must be antisymmetric (singlet, S=0). If the orbital part is antisymmetric (odd L), the spin part must be symmetric (triplet, S=1).\n\nBut in the reaction, the initial angular momentum is J=1. The final total angular momentum must also be J=1. So the sum of the spin and orbital angular momentum of the two neutrons must be 1.\n\nSo possible combinations: S=0 and L=1 (since 0 +1=1), or S=1 and L=0,1,2... but considering that L and S must combine to give total J=1.\n\nBut we also need to consider the parity. The initial parity is the product of the parities of the deuteron, pion, and the orbital parity. The deuteron is in an S-state (L=0), so its parity is even (since for orbital L, parity is (-1)^L). The pion is a pseudoscalar, so parity -1. The initial orbital angular momentum between π⁻ and deuteron is L=0 (S-wave), so parity is (+1). So total initial parity is (-1) * (+1) * (+1) = -1.\n\nThe final state parity is the product of the intrinsic parities of the two neutrons and the orbital parity. Neutrons are fermions with intrinsic parity +1 (assuming standard convention). So each neutron contributes +1, so together that's (+1)(+1) = +1. The orbital parity is (-1)^L. So total parity is (+1)*(-1)^L. This must equal the initial parity of -1. Therefore:\n\n(+1)*(-1)^L = -1 ⇒ (-1)^L = -1 ⇒ L must be odd.\n\nSo L must be odd: 1, 3, 5...\n\nBut in nuclear reactions, the lowest possible L is usually dominant, especially if the reaction is at low energy. Since the pion was in the lowest energy state (S-wave), the final state's orbital angular momentum is likely the lowest possible odd number, which is L=1 (P-wave).\n\nTherefore, the orbital angular momentum of the neutron pair is L=1.\n\n**Part (b): Total Spin Angular Momentum of the Neutrons**\n\nFrom the previous part, since L must be odd (L=1), the spin state must be symmetric (since for odd L, the orbital part is antisymmetric, so spin must be symmetric). Symmetric spin states for two neutrons are the triplet states (S=1). Because each neutron has spin 1/2, the symmetric combinations are S=1 (triplet) and antisymmetric is S=0 (singlet). Since we need symmetric here, S=1.\n\nBut wait, the total angular momentum J must be 1. The total angular momentum is the vector sum of L and S. So L=1 and S=1. The possible total J values from L=1 and S=1 are J=0,1,2. But the initial J was 1, so the final J must be 1. Therefore, the combination of L=1 and S=1 must result in J=1. This is possible because when you add L=1 and S=1, you can get J=1 through vector addition. So the spin S=1 is allowed, and with L=1, the total J can be 1.\n\nTherefore, the total spin angular momentum of the neutrons is S=1.\n\n**Part (c): Probability for Both Neutron Spins Opposite to Deuteron's Spin**\n\nThe deuteron's initial spin is in the ^3S₁ state, so its spin is 1. Let's assume the deuteron is polarized in a specific direction, say along the z-axis with spin projection M=1. The problem asks for the probability that both neutrons have spins opposite to the deuteron's spin direction. Wait, but each neutron is spin-1/2. So \"opposite\" would mean each neutron has spin down (since the deuteron's spin is up). But since the deuteron's total spin is 1, maybe we need to consider the spin state of the two neutrons such that their combined spin is opposite. Wait, the question is phrased as \"both neutron spins directed opposite the spin of the deuteron\". Hmm.\n\nWait, the deuteron's spin is 1. If the deuteron is in a state with spin projection +1 along some axis, then \"opposite\" would be each neutron having spin -1/2 along that axis. But since the neutrons are spin-1/2, their individual spins can be up or down. The question is asking for the probability that both have their spins opposite to the deuteron's spin direction. So if the deuteron's spin is up (say along the z-axis), then both neutrons have spin down.\n\nBut the total spin of the two neutrons is S=1 (from part b). The spin state of the two neutrons must be in the triplet state (S=1). The triplet states are symmetric. The possible states are:\n\n- |1,1⟩ = |↑↑⟩\n- |1,0⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2\n- |1,-1⟩ = |↓↓⟩\n\nBut the deuteron's initial spin is 1, and assuming it's in the |1,1⟩ state (maximum projection), then the final spin state of the neutrons must have total spin S=1. The question is asking for the probability that both neutrons have spins opposite to the deuteron's direction. If the deuteron was in |1,1⟩, then opposite would be each neutron having spin down, which corresponds to |1,-1⟩.\n\nBut the initial angular momentum is J=1, and the final state must have J=1. However, the spin state here is part of the total angular momentum. The total angular momentum includes both spin and orbital parts. But since the orbital part is L=1 and spin S=1, their combination gives possible J=0,1,2. But we need J=1. So the final state must be a combination where L=1 and S=1 couple to J=1.\n\nBut the problem is about the spin state of the neutrons, regardless of the orbital part. Wait, but the probability might depend on the spin state alone. Let me think.\n\nThe deuteron's initial spin is 1, and the reaction conserves angular momentum. The final state's total angular momentum is J=1. The spin of the neutrons is S=1, and their orbital angular momentum is L=1. The coupling of L and S to J=1 can occur in different ways. However, the question is about the probability of both neutron spins being opposite to the deuteron's spin direction. Let's assume the deuteron was initially in a state with spin projection M=1. Then, the final state's spin projection would need to be considered.\n\nBut the spin state of the neutrons that is |1,-1⟩ (both spins down) has a spin projection of -1. However, the total angular momentum projection must be conserved. The initial projection is M_initial = +1 (deuteron's spin). The final projection M_final is the sum of the spin projection and the orbital projection. The orbital angular momentum L=1 can have m_l = -1, 0, +1. The spin projection m_s can be -1, 0, +1. To have total M_final = +1, we need m_l + m_s = +1.\n\nIf we are looking for the case where both neutrons have spin down (m_s = -1), then m_l must be +2 to get m_l + m_s = +1. But L=1 can only have m_l up to +1. Therefore, this combination is impossible. Wait, that can't be right. There's a contradiction here. Maybe I need to reconsider.\n\nWait, the total angular momentum J is 1, so the projection M can be -1, 0, +1. The initial M is +1 (assuming the deuteron is in M=1). The final state must have M=1. The final state's M is the sum of the spin projection (m_s) and the orbital projection (m_l). So m_s + m_l = 1.\n\nIf the spin state is |1,-1⟩ (m_s = -1), then m_l must be 2 to get M=1. But L=1 can't have m_l=2. Therefore, this combination is impossible. Therefore, the state where both neutrons have spin down (m_s=-1) cannot contribute to the M=1 final state. Hence, the probability might be zero. But that seems counterintuitive. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial deuteron is in a state with M=1, and the reaction leads to a final state with M=1. The spin state of the neutrons must combine with the orbital state to give total M=1. Let's consider the possible combinations:\n\nFor L=1 (m_l = -1,0,1) and S=1 (m_s = -1,0,1). The total M = m_l + m_s. We need M=1. So possible combinations:\n\n- m_l=1, m_s=0 → M=1\n- m_l=0, m_s=1 → M=1\n- m_l=2, m_s=-1 → Not possible (m_l can't be 2)\n- Similarly, other combinations.\n\nSo the allowed (m_l, m_s) pairs are (1,0) and (0,1). The total state is a combination of these possibilities. The spin state with m_s=1 is |1,1⟩ (both spins up), and m_s=0 is |1,0⟩. The case where both spins are down (m_s=-1) isn't part of the M=1 final state. Therefore, the probability of both spins being opposite (down) is zero. But wait, the deuteron's spin direction is up (M=1), so opposite would be down. But if the final state can't have both spins down, then the probability is zero. But that seems too quick.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is not about the projection but the direction. If the deuteron's spin is in a certain direction, what's the probability that both neutrons have spins opposite, regardless of the total projection. But since the total spin is S=1, the possible states are triplet. The state where both are opposite (down) is |1,-1⟩. But in the final state, due to angular momentum conservation, this state can only be present if the total M can be -1. But the initial M was +1, so the final M must be +1. Therefore, |1,-1⟩ is not part of the final state. Hence, the probability is zero. But that seems possible.\n\nWait, but maybe the initial deuteron isn't in a specific M state but is averaged. However, the problem says \"the probability for finding both neutron spins directed opposite the spin of the deuteron\". Assuming the deuteron's spin is in a definite direction (say z-axis), then the question is asking for the probability that both neutrons have spin down. But in the triplet state, the only state with both spins down is |1,-1⟩. However, in the reaction, the total angular momentum projection must be conserved. If the initial projection is +1, the final must be +1. The |1,-1⟩ spin state would require the orbital part to have m_l=+2 to get M=1, which is impossible. Therefore, the amplitude for this state is zero. Hence, the probability is zero.\n\nBut wait, maybe the deuteron's spin isn't polarized, but the question is about the spin direction opposite to the deuteron's spin direction. If the deuteron's spin is S=1, then the opposite direction would be S= -1? But neutrons are spin-1/2, so each can't have S=-1. Maybe the question is phrased as each neutron's spin being opposite to the deuteron's spin direction. If the deuteron's spin is up, then each neutron's spin is down. But in the triplet state, the only way both are down is |1,-1⟩. As before, this can't contribute to M=1. Therefore, the probability is zero. But that seems too strong. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to have some component.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spin state irrespective of the orbital angular momentum. But the total wavefunction includes both. However, the probability would involve the overlap between the desired spin state (both down) and the total wavefunction.\n\nWait, the total wavefunction is a product of spin and orbital parts, but properly coupled to J=1. The spin part is S=1, and the orbital part L=1. The coupling of L and S to J=1 can be expressed via Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state |J=1, M=1⟩ can be written as a combination of |L=1, m_l; S=1, m_s⟩ such that m_l + m_s =1.\n\nThe possible terms are:\n\n- |L=1, m_l=1⟩ |S=1, m_s=0⟩\n- |L=1, m_l=0⟩ |S=1, m_s=1⟩\n\nThe coefficients can be found using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling L=1 and S=1 to J=1, M=1.\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=1, S=1, J=1, M=1 are:\n\n⟨1,1;1,0 |1,1⟩ and ⟨1,0;1,1 |1,1⟩.\n\nThe coefficients are:\n\nFor the first term (m_l=1, m_s=0):\n\n⟨1,1;1,0 |1,1⟩ = sqrt(1/2)\n\nFor the second term (m_l=0, m_s=1):\n\n⟨1,0;1,1 |1,1⟩ = sqrt(1/2)\n\nSo the total state is:\n\nsqrt(1/2) |L=1, m_l=1⟩ |S=1, m_s=0⟩ + sqrt(1/2) |L=1, m_l=0⟩ |S=1, m_s=1⟩\n\nNow, the spin state |S=1, m_s=0⟩ is (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/sqrt(2), and |S=1, m_s=1⟩ is |↑↑⟩.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that both neutrons have spins opposite to the deuteron's spin. If the deuteron's spin was up (M=1), then \"opposite\" would be both spins down. The spin state |↓↓⟩ corresponds to |S=1, m_s=-1⟩, which is not present in the above combination. Therefore, the amplitude for |↓↓⟩ is zero in the final state. Hence, the probability is zero.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way. Suppose the deuteron's spin is in some direction, and we want the neutrons' spins to be opposite to that. But since the deuteron's spin is S=1, and the neutrons are S=1/2 each, it's not straightforward. However, the problem states \"both neutron spins directed opposite the spin of the deuteron\". If the deuteron's spin is up (say along z-axis), then each neutron's spin is down. But as we saw, this state isn't present in the allowed spin states for the final J=1. Therefore, the probability is zero.\n\nBut that seems surprising. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nThe possible spin states for the neutrons are triplet (S=1). The states are:\n\n- |↑↑⟩ (m_s=1)\n- (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2 (m_s=0)\n- |↓↓⟩ (m_s=-1)\n\nBut in the final state, due to angular momentum conservation, only the m_s=0 and m_s=1 components are present (as per the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition above). The m_s=-1 component isn't part of the J=1, M=1 state. Therefore, the probability of both spins being down (m_s=-1) is zero. Hence, the answer is zero.\n\n**Part (d): Angular Dependence of Neutron Emission Probability**\n\nThe deuteron is initially 100% polarized in the k-direction (say z-axis). We need to find the angular dependence of the neutron emission probability for a neutron whose spin is opposite to the deuteron's spin.\n\nAssuming the deuteron's spin is along the z-axis (k-direction), the neutron's spin opposite would be along -z. The angular dependence would come from the orbital part of the wavefunction, which has L=1 (P-wave). The spherical harmonics for L=1 are given in the problem statement.\n\nThe emission probability is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the wavefunction. The orbital state is L=1, and the possible m_l values are -1, 0, +1. But the total wavefunction must have J=1 and M=1 (if the initial deuteron's M=1). However, the problem is about the angular distribution of a neutron with spin opposite to the deuteron's spin.\n\nWait, the neutron's spin being opposite to the deuteron's spin. The deuteron's spin is along k (z-axis), so the neutron's spin is along -z. But each neutron is part of a pair with total spin S=1. However, we are to consider the angular distribution of a neutron whose spin is opposite. This might involve considering the spin state and the orbital angular momentum.\n\nAlternatively, since the neutrons are emitted in a state with orbital angular momentum L=1, their spatial wavefunction is proportional to Y₁^m(θ, φ). The spin state is part of the triplet state. The emission probability would depend on the direction (θ, φ) of the neutron. But since we're asked about the angular dependence for a neutron with spin opposite to the deuteron's spin, we need to project the spin state onto the opposite direction and find the angular distribution.\n\nThis is similar to analyzing the angular distribution in a decay process where the decay products have certain spin correlations. The probability will depend on the angle between the neutron's momentum and the initial spin direction (z-axis), and the spin state.\n\nThe emission probability can be found using the differential cross-section or decay rate formula, which involves the square of the amplitude. The amplitude would involve the spherical harmonics and the spin wavefunction.\n\nSince the orbital angular momentum is L=1, the spatial part is proportional to Y₁^m(θ, φ). The spin part must combine with this to give total J=1. But the question is specifically about neutrons with spin opposite to the deuteron's spin. Let's model this.\n\nAssume the deuteron's spin is along the z-axis (k-direction). The neutrons are emitted in some direction (θ, φ). We need to find the probability that a neutron emitted in direction (θ, φ) has spin down (opposite to deuteron's spin).\n\nThe spin state of the two neutrons is in the triplet state. However, we are looking at one neutron's spin. Since the neutrons are identical particles, we have to consider their wavefunction properly. But perhaps we can model this using the density matrix or by considering the correlation between spin and direction.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the spin and orbital parts are coupled. The total state is a combination of spin and orbital parts. For the neutron pair, the spatial wavefunction is Y₁^m(θ, φ), and the spin state is |S=1, m_s⟩. The combination must give total J=1, M=1.\n\nFrom part (c), the total state is a combination of:\n\nsqrt(1/2) Y₁^1(θ, φ) |S=1, m_s=0⟩ + sqrt(1/2) Y₁^0(θ, φ) |S=1, m_s=1⟩\n\nBut wait, the spatial part is actually the wavefunction of the relative coordinate between the two neutrons. The emission direction would be related to the direction of the relative momentum. However, for simplicity, let's assume that the angular distribution is given by the spherical harmonics squared.\n\nBut the problem asks for the angular dependence of the neutron emission probability for a neutron whose spin is opposite to the deuteron's. Let's think in terms of the spin being measured in the opposite direction. The probability would involve the overlap between the neutron's spin state (down) and the spin part of the wavefunction, multiplied by the spatial part.\n\nHowever, since the neutrons are identical particles and the spin state is entangled, this might be more complex. Let's consider that the two neutrons are emitted in opposite directions (due to momentum conservation), but we are looking at one neutron. The spin of one neutron being down would require the other to have a certain spin to maintain the total spin state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angular distribution is determined by the spherical harmonics associated with the orbital angular momentum L=1. The spherical harmonics for L=1 are given as Y₁^0 = cosθ, Y₁^±1 = ∓ sinθ e^{±iφ}/sqrt(2) (but the problem lists them as Y¹_±1 = ∓ sinθ e^{±iϕ} without normalization). Wait, the problem states:\n\nY^0_0 = 1,\n\nY^{±1}_1 = ∓ sinθ e^{±iϕ},\n\nY^0_1 = cosθ,\n\nY^{±1}_2 = ∓ sin2θ e^{±iϕ}.\n\nSo the Y₁^m are:\n\nY₁^1 = - sinθ e^{iϕ},\n\nY₁^0 = cosθ,\n\nY₁^{-1} = sinθ e^{-iϕ}.\n\nBut the coefficients are ∓ for m=±1. So Y₁^1 = - sinθ e^{iϕ}, Y₁^{-1} = sinθ e^{-iϕ}.\n\nThe spatial wavefunction is a combination of these Y₁^m terms. From the total state we derived earlier, which is a combination of m_l=1 and m_l=0 with corresponding spin states.\n\nBut the emission probability for a neutron with spin opposite (down) would involve projecting the spin part onto |↓⟩ and then finding the angular dependence.\n\nLet me try to model this. The total wavefunction for the two neutrons is:\n\nΨ = sqrt(1/2) [Y₁^1(θ, φ) |S=1, m_s=0⟩ + Y₁^0(θ, φ) |S=1, m_s=1⟩ ]\n\nBut |S=1, m_s=0⟩ is (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2,\n\nand |S=1, m_s=1⟩ is |↑↑⟩.\n\nWe need to find the probability that one neutron has spin down. However, since the neutrons are identical, we can't distinguish them. The spin state |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ corresponds to one up and one down, symmetrized. The |↑↑⟩ state has both up.\n\nIf we measure one neutron's spin to be down, then the other must be up in the |S=1, m_s=0⟩ state. The probability amplitude for this would come from the first term (Y₁^1 multiplied by (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩)/√2) and the second term (Y₁^0 multiplied by |↑↑⟩), but the second term doesn't contribute to a down spin.\n\nSo the amplitude for finding one neutron with spin down is from the first term:\n\nsqrt(1/2) * Y₁^1(θ, φ) * (1/√2) [ |↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩ ]\n\nThe factor 1/√2 comes from the spin state normalization. The probability would then involve |sqrt(1/2) * Y₁^1 * 1/√2 |² = (1/2) * |Y₁^1|² * (probability of spin down in that term).\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Alternatively, the angular dependence for the case where one neutron has spin down would be proportional to |Y₁^1|² + |Y₁^0|² contribution from the spin states that allow a down spin. However, in our case, the second term (Y₁^0 |↑↑⟩) doesn't contribute to spin down, so only the first term contributes.\n\nThe Y₁^1 term contributes to spin down with amplitude sqrt(1/2) * (1/√2) = 1/2. The angular part is Y₁^1 = - sinθ e^{iφ}. The probability is proportional to |Y₁^1|² = sin²θ. But the coefficient would be (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So the angular dependence from this term is sin²θ.\n\nBut wait, the total probability also includes the other possible contributions. However, in our case, the second term (Y₁^0 |↑↑⟩) doesn't contribute to spin down, so the entire probability comes from the first term. Therefore, the angular dependence is proportional to sin²θ.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the angular dependence of the neutron emission probability (per unit solid angle) for a neutron whose spin is opposite to that of the initial deuteron\". So the answer would be proportional to sin²θ. But let's check the possible options given the spherical harmonics provided.\n\nThe given spherical harmonics are:\n\nY₁^0 = cosθ,\n\nY₁^{±1} = ∓ sinθ e^{±iϕ},\n\nSo |Y₁^1|² = sin²θ,\n\n|Y₁^0|² = cos²θ.\n\nBut in our case, the relevant term is Y₁^1, so the probability is proportional to sin²θ. However, the problem might require considering the sum over all m components that contribute to spin down. But from the earlier analysis, only the m_l=1 term contributes to spin down, leading to sin²θ dependence.\n\nAlternatively, if the spin measurement is along the same axis as the deuteron's polarization (z-axis), then the angle θ is measured from the z-axis. The probability for a neutron emitted at angle θ to have spin down would be proportional to sin²θ. Therefore, the angular dependence is sin²θ.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions \"per unit solid angle\", which includes the azimuthal angle φ. However, the given spherical harmonics have e^{iϕ} dependence, but when you take the square, the φ dependence cancels out. For example, |Y₁^1|² = sin²θ, since the e^{iϕ} term's magnitude is 1. Therefore, the angular dependence is sin²θ, independent of φ. Hence, the probability per unit solid angle is proportional to sin²θ.\n\nBut the problem might want the answer in terms of the given spherical harmonics. Since Y₁^0 is cosθ and Y₁^{±1} have sinθ terms, the square of Y₁^{±1} is sin²θ. Therefore, the angular dependence is sin²θ, which can be written in terms of the spherical harmonics as |Y₁^1|² + |Y₁^{-1}|² = 2 sin²θ (since both m=+1 and m=-1 contribute equally). However, in our case, only m=+1 contributes because the initial M=1. Wait, no. The initial M=1, so the final M=1. The combination that contributes to spin down is only from the m_l=1 term, which has Y₁^1. Therefore, the angular dependence is |Y₁^1|² = sin²θ. But since the problem states \"per unit solid angle\", and solid angle includes φ, but the dependence is only on θ, the answer is proportional to sin²θ.\n\nBut the problem might want the answer expressed using the given spherical harmonics. However, since the probability is proportional to sin²θ, and sin²θ = (1 - cos²θ) = 1 - (Y₁^0)^2 (since Y₁^0 = cosθ). But that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, note that the given Y²^{±1} are proportional to sin2θ, but we don't need that here.\n\nThe final answer for part (d) is that the angular dependence is proportional to sin²θ, which is the square of Y₁^1 or Y₁^{-1}. But since the deuteron is polarized along k (z-axis), and the emission is in direction (θ, φ), the probability is independent of φ due to symmetry around the z-axis. Therefore, the angular dependence is sin²θ.\n\nBut wait, in the initial state, the deuteron is polarized along k, which is the z-axis. The emission probability should be axially symmetric around z, so no φ dependence. Hence, the probability per unit solid angle is proportional to sin²θ. Therefore, the answer is sin²θ, or in terms of spherical harmonics, but since they are not normalized, the given Y₁^1 is proportional to sinθ. So |Y₁^1|² is sin²θ. Therefore, the angular dependence is sin²θ.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n(a) The orbital angular momentum is \\( \\boxed{1} \\).\n\n(b) The total spin angular momentum is \\( \\boxed{1} \\).\n\n(c) The probability is \\( \\boxed{0} \\).\n\n(d) The angular dependence is proportional to \\( \\boxed{\\sin^2 \\theta} \\).\n</think>\n\n(a) **Orbital Angular Momentum of the Neutron Pair**\n\nThe initial total angular momentum is determined by the deuteron's spin (J=1) and the π⁻ meson's orbital angular momentum (L=0).

{"id": "atomic/3-36", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The question is about the principle of detailed balance relating the cross sections of a reaction and its inverse. So, the reaction given is gamma plus proton going to pi+ plus neutron, and the inverse is pi+ plus neutron going to gamma plus proton. We need to find how σ_II(W) relates to σ_I(W) using detailed balance.\n\nI remember that detailed balance connects the cross sections of forward and inverse reactions by considering the spin states, phase space factors, and possibly the velocities of the incoming particles. The general formula, I think, involves the ratio of the spin statistical factors and the momenta of the particles in the initial and final states.\n\nThe formula for detailed balance is usually something like σ_II / σ_I = (g_a g_b / g_c g_d) * (p_initial^2 / p_final^2) * (something else?), where g's are the spin degeneracy factors, and p_initial and p_final are the momenta in the center-of-mass frame for the respective reactions.\n\nWait, let me recall. For the reaction a + b → c + d, the detailed balance relation for the inverse reaction c + d → a + b would relate their cross sections. The exact relation should account for the spin degrees of freedom and the phase space factors. The cross sections are related by:\n\nσ_II / σ_I = ( (2s_a + 1)(2s_b + 1) ) / ( (2s_c + 1)(2s_d + 1) ) ) * ( p_initial^2 / p_final^2 )\n\nBut wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. The cross section for the inverse reaction would have the spins of the initial particles in the inverse process. So, in reaction I, the initial particles are gamma and proton, and the final are pi+ and neutron. In reaction II, the initial are pi+ and neutron, and the final are gamma and proton.\n\nSo, the spin factors would be the product of the spin degeneracies of the initial states for each reaction. For reaction I, initial spins: photon has spin 1 (so 2s+1 = 3), proton has spin 1/2 (so 2s+1 = 2). The final state: pi+ is a pseudoscalar meson, so spin 0 (2s+1 = 1), neutron spin 1/2 (2s+1 = 2). So the spin factor ratio would be (g_c * g_d) / (g_a * g_b) for the inverse reaction. Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nThe detailed balance formula is:\n\nσ_II / σ_I = [ (2s_a + 1)(2s_b + 1) / (2s_c + 1)(2s_d + 1) ) ] * ( p_final^2 / p_initial^2 )\n\nWait, maybe. Because when you reverse the reaction, the initial state becomes the final state. The general formula from detailed balance is:\n\nσ(forward) / σ(inverse) = [ (g_c g_d) / (g_a g_b) ) ] * ( p_inverse^2 / p_forward^2 )\n\nBut I need to be careful here. Let me look up the detailed balance formula in my mind. The principle states that in equilibrium, each process is balanced by its reverse. For cross sections, the relation is:\n\nσ(a + b → c + d) / σ(c + d → a + b) = [ (g_c g_d) / (g_a g_b) ) ] * ( p_cd^2 / p_ab^2 ) * ( (1 + δ_{cd}) / (1 + δ_{ab}) ) )\n\nBut maybe the delta factors are for identical particles. Since in this problem, the reactions don't involve identical particles, so maybe those factors are 1. Alternatively, sometimes the formula is written as:\n\nσ_II / σ_I = ( (2s_a + 1)(2s_b + 1) / (2s_c + 1)(2s_d + 1) ) * ( p_ab^2 / p_cd^2 )\n\nWait, but which reaction is which? Let me clarify variables.\n\nIn reaction I: γ + p → π+ + n. So, initial particles are γ (s=1) and p (s=1/2). Final particles are π+ (s=0) and n (s=1/2). The spin factors for the initial state in reaction I: (2s_γ +1)(2s_p +1) = (3)(2) = 6. For the final state: (2s_π +1)(2s_n +1) = (1)(2) = 2.\n\nIn reaction II: π+ + n → γ + p. So, initial particles are π+ (s=0) and n (s=1/2). Final particles are γ (s=1) and p (s=1/2). Spin factors for initial state in reaction II: (1)(2) = 2. Final state: (3)(2) = 6.\n\nBut according to detailed balance, the cross sections are related by the ratio of the spin factors multiplied by the ratio of the squared momenta in the initial state of each reaction.\n\nWait, the formula is:\n\nσ_II / σ_I = [ ( (2s_a +1)(2s_b +1) ) / ( (2s_c +1)(2s_d +1) ) ) ] * ( p_I^2 / p_II^2 )\n\nBut wait, p_I is the center-of-mass momentum in reaction I, which is the momentum of the initial particles (γ and p) in their CM frame. Similarly, p_II is the momentum of the initial particles (π+ and n) in their CM frame. But since the total energy W is the same for both reactions, the momenta should be different because the masses are different.\n\nWait, in the CM frame, the momentum of each particle in the initial state can be calculated using the formula for two-body initial states. The magnitude of the momentum p is given by:\n\np = [ (s - (m1 + m2)^2 )(s - (m1 - m2)^2 ) ]^(1/2) / (2√s)\n\nBut here, s is W^2. Wait, the formula for the magnitude of the 3-momentum in the CM frame for two particles with masses m1 and m2 is:\n\np_initial = sqrt( [ (W^2 - (m1 + m2)^2)(W^2 - (m1 - m2)^2) ] ) / (2W)\n\nSo for reaction I: initial particles are γ (mass 0) and proton (mass m). So m1 = 0, m2 = m. Then,\n\np_I = [ (W^2 - m^2) * (W^2 - m^2) ) ]^(1/2) / (2W) ) = (W^2 - m^2) / (2W)\n\nWait, let's compute that. If m1=0, m2=m, then:\n\np_initial = [ (W^2 - (0 + m)^2)(W^2 - (0 - m)^2) ]^(1/2) / (2W)\n\nBut (0 - m)^2 is m^2, so both terms are (W^2 - m^2). So sqrt( (W^2 - m^2)^2 ) = W^2 - m^2. Then,\n\np_I = (W^2 - m^2) / (2W)\n\nSimilarly, for reaction II: initial particles are π+ (mass μ) and neutron (mass m). So m1=μ, m2=m. Then,\n\np_II = sqrt( [ (W^2 - (μ + m)^2)(W^2 - (μ - m)^2) ] ) / (2W)\n\nSo the ratio p_I^2 / p_II^2 would be [ (W^2 - m^2)^2 / (4W^2) ] / [ ( (W^2 - (μ + m)^2)(W^2 - (μ - m)^2) ) / (4W^2) ) ]\n\nSimplifying, the 4W^2 cancels, so:\n\n(p_I / p_II)^2 = (W^2 - m^2)^2 / [ (W^2 - (μ + m)^2)(W^2 - (μ - m)^2) ) ]\n\nBut let's compute the denominator:\n\n(W^2 - (μ + m)^2)(W^2 - (μ - m)^2) = [W^2 - (μ^2 + 2μm + m^2)][W^2 - (μ^2 - 2μm + m^2)]\n\n= [ (W^2 - μ^2 - m^2) - 2μm ][ (W^2 - μ^2 - m^2) + 2μm ]\n\n= (W^2 - μ^2 - m^2)^2 - (2μm)^2\n\n= W^4 - 2W^2(μ^2 + m^2) + (μ^2 + m^2)^2 - 4μ²m²\n\n= W^4 - 2W^2(μ² + m²) + μ^4 + 2μ²m² + m^4 - 4μ²m²\n\n= W^4 - 2W^2(μ² + m²) + μ^4 - 2μ²m² + m^4\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Let me check:\n\nAlternatively, (W^2 - (μ + m)^2)(W^2 - (μ - m)^2) = [W^2 - (μ + m)^2][W^2 - (μ - m)^2] = (W^2 - μ^2 - 2μm - m^2)(W^2 - μ^2 + 2μm - m^2)\n\n= ( (W^2 - μ^2 - m^2) - 2μm ) ( (W^2 - μ^2 - m^2) + 2μm )\n\n= (W^2 - μ^2 - m^2)^2 - (2μm)^2\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, the ratio (p_I / p_II)^2 is (W^2 - m^2)^2 / [ (W^2 - μ^2 - m^2)^2 - (2μm)^2 ]\n\nBut maybe this can be simplified. Let me compute the denominator:\n\n(W^2 - μ^2 - m^2)^2 - (2μm)^2 = W^4 - 2W^2(μ^2 + m^2) + (μ^2 + m^2)^2 - 4μ²m²\n\n= W^4 - 2W^2(μ² + m²) + μ^4 + 2μ²m² + m^4 - 4μ²m²\n\n= W^4 - 2W^2(μ² + m²) + μ^4 - 2μ²m² + m^4\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor the denominator:\n\n(W^2 - (μ + m)^2)(W^2 - (μ - m)^2) = [W^2 - (μ + m)^2][W^2 - (μ - m)^2]\n\nBut maybe it's better to leave it as is for the ratio.\n\nPutting it all together, the ratio of cross sections is:\n\nσ_II / σ_I = [ (g_γ g_p) / (g_π g_n) ) ] * ( p_II^2 / p_I^2 )\n\nWait, no. Wait, the formula is:\n\nσ_II / σ_I = [ (g_a g_b) / (g_c g_d) ) ] * ( p_I^2 / p_II^2 )\n\nWait, because in the inverse reaction, the initial particles are c and d (π+ and n), so their spin factors are (g_π g_n), and the original reaction's initial particles are a and b (γ and p), so (g_γ g_p). But according to detailed balance, the cross section for the inverse reaction is related by the spin factors of the original reaction's initial and final states.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nσ_II = σ_I * [ ( (2s_c +1)(2s_d +1) ) / ( (2s_a +1)(2s_b +1) ) ) ] * ( p_I^2 / p_II^2 )\n\nWait, let me check a reference. The detailed balance formula states that:\n\nσ(a + b → c + d) / σ(c + d → a + b) = [ ( (2s_c +1)(2s_d +1) ) / ( (2s_a +1)(2s_b +1) ) ) ] * ( p_ab^2 / p_cd^2 )\n\nBut since we are relating σ_II (which is σ(c + d → a + b)) to σ_I (σ(a + b → c + d)), then:\n\nσ_II = σ_I * [ ( (2s_a +1)(2s_b +1) ) / ( (2s_c +1)(2s_d +1) ) ) ] * ( p_ab^2 / p_cd^2 )\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The formula is:\n\nσ_forward / σ_backward = [ (g_c g_d) / (g_a g_b) ) ] * ( p_forward^2 / p_backward^2 )\n\nBut in terms of the same W, since both cross sections are evaluated at the same W. Wait, but in the forward direction, the initial particles are a and b, so their CM momentum is p_ab, and in the backward direction, the initial particles are c and d, so their CM momentum is p_cd. So the ratio would involve (p_ab^2 / p_cd^2) multiplied by the spin factors.\n\nBut according to detailed balance, the cross sections are related by:\n\nσ_II(W) = σ_I(W) * [ ( (2s_a +1)(2s_b +1) ) / ( (2s_c +1)(2s_d +1) ) ) ] * ( p_I^2 / p_II^2 )\n\nWhere p_I is the CM momentum in reaction I (γ + p), and p_II is the CM momentum in reaction II (π+ + n). So substituting the spin factors:\n\nFor reaction I, initial spins: γ (s=1, so 2s+1=3), p (s=1/2, so 2s+1=2). So product is 3*2=6.\n\nFor reaction II, initial spins: π+ (s=0, so 1), n (s=1/2, so 2). Product is 1*2=2.\n\nSo the ratio of spin factors is (6 / 2) = 3.\n\nBut wait, in the formula, it's ( (2s_a +1)(2s_b +1) ) / ( (2s_c +1)(2s_d +1) ), where a and b are the initial particles of the forward reaction (γ + p), and c and d are the initial particles of the inverse reaction (π+ + n). Wait, no. Wait, in the formula, when you write σ_II (inverse reaction) in terms of σ_I (forward reaction), the spin factors in the numerator are those of the original reaction's initial particles, and the denominator are those of the inverse reaction's initial particles. Wait, maybe I need to reverse it.\n\nAlternatively, the formula is:\n\nσ_II / σ_I = [ (g_a g_b) / (g_c g_d) ) ] * ( p_I^2 / p_II^2 )\n\nBut in this case, for σ_II being the inverse reaction, the initial particles are c and d. So the spin factors in the numerator would be g_c g_d, and denominator g_a g_b? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe detailed balance formula is derived from time-reversal symmetry. The cross sections are related by:\n\nσ(a + b → c + d) / σ(c + d → a + b) = [ (g_c g_d) / (g_a g_b) ) ] * ( p_{cd}^2 / p_{ab}^2 )\n\nBut since we are considering the same total energy W, the center-of-mass energy is the same. So p_ab is the momentum in the initial state of reaction I (a + b), and p_cd is the momentum in the initial state of reaction II (c + d). Therefore, the ratio of cross sections is:\n\nσ_II / σ_I = [ (g_a g_b) / (g_c g_d) ) ] * ( p_{ab}^2 / p_{cd}^2 )\n\nWait, this is conflicting. Let me check a textbook formula.\n\nIn Landau and Lifshitz, Quantum Mechanics, Non-Relativistic Theory, §144, the relation for the cross sections of mutually inverse processes under time reversal is given by:\n\ndσ_{a + b → c + d} / dΩ = ( p_{cd}^2 / p_{ab}^2 ) * ( (2s_c +1)(2s_d +1) ) / ( (2s_a +1)(2s_b +1) ) ) * dσ_{c + d → a + b} / dΩ\n\nBut this is for differential cross sections. However, in the problem, we are given integrated cross sections (integrated over angles, summed over final spins, averaged over initial spins). So integrating over angles would remove the angular dependence, and the relation would hold for the total cross sections as well.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the total cross sections would be:\n\nσ_I / σ_II = ( p_{cd}^2 / p_{ab}^2 ) * ( (2s_c +1)(2s_d +1) ) / ( (2s_a +1)(2s_b +1) ) )\n\nHence, solving for σ_II:\n\nσ_II = σ_I * ( (2s_a +1)(2s_b +1) / (2s_c +1)(2s_d +1) ) * ( p_{ab}^2 / p_{cd}^2 )\n\nIn our case:\n\nFor σ_I: a = γ, b = p; c = π+, d = n.\n\nFor σ_II: the inverse reaction, so initial particles c and d (π+ and n), final particles a and b (γ and p).\n\nThus:\n\n(2s_a +1)(2s_b +1) = (2*1 +1)(2*(1/2)+1) = 3 * 2 = 6\n\n(2s_c +1)(2s_d +1) = (2*0 +1)(2*(1/2)+1) = 1 * 2 = 2\n\nSo the spin factor ratio is 6/2 = 3.\n\nThe momentum ratio is (p_ab^2 / p_cd^2) = [ (W^2 - m^2)^2 / (4W^2) ) ] / [ ( (W^2 - (μ + m)^2)(W^2 - (μ - m)^2) ) / (4W^2) ) ] = (W^2 - m^2)^2 / [ (W^2 - (μ + m)^2)(W^2 - (μ - m)^2) )\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nσ_II(W) = σ_I(W) * 3 * ( (W^2 - m^2)^2 ) / [ (W^2 - (μ + m)^2)(W^2 - (μ - m)^2) )\n\nSimplifying the denominator:\n\n(W^2 - (μ + m)^2)(W^2 - (μ - m)^2) = [W^2 - μ^2 - 2μm - m^2][W^2 - μ^2 + 2μm - m^2] = (W^2 - μ^2 - m^2)^2 - (2μm)^2\n\nBut perhaps it's better to leave it as is.\n\nSo the final expression for part (a) is:\n\nσ_{II}(W) = σ_{I}(W) \\times \\frac{3 (W^2 - m^2)^2}{(W^2 - (\\mu + m)^2)(W^2 - (\\mu - m)^2))}\n\nAlternatively, written as:\n\nσ_{II}(W) = \\sigma_I(W) \\cdot \\frac{3 (W^2 - m^2)^2}{(W^2 - (\\mu + m)^2)(W^2 - (\\mu - m)^2)}\n\nThat's part (a).\n\nNow part (b): For reaction II (π+ + n → γ + p), what is the threshold value W_thresh and how does σ_II(W) vary with W just above threshold?\n\nThreshold occurs when the initial particles have just enough energy to produce the final particles. The threshold energy is when the CM energy W is equal to the sum of the rest masses of the final state particles. In reaction II, the final state is γ (mass 0) and proton (mass m). So the threshold W is m + 0 = m. Wait, but wait, the initial state is π+ (mass μ) and neutron (mass m). So the total rest mass is μ + m. But the final state is γ (0) + p (m). So the minimum W required is m, but the initial particles have a rest mass of μ + m. Therefore, the threshold occurs when W is equal to the maximum of the rest mass of the initial and final states. Wait, no. Threshold is when the CM energy is sufficient to create the final particles. Since the initial particles have a rest mass of μ + m, but the final particles have a rest mass of m. So the threshold is when W is equal to the rest mass of the final state, which is m. But since the initial particles have a rest mass of μ + m, which is larger than m (assuming μ is the pion mass, which is about 140 MeV, and m is the nucleon mass ~938 MeV), so μ + m is about 1078 MeV. But the final state requires W ≥ m. However, since the initial particles are π+ and n with total rest mass μ + m, the actual threshold for the reaction π+ + n → γ + p is when the CM energy W is equal to the sum of the final state masses, which is m (since γ is massless). But wait, this seems contradictory. Because in the CM frame, the initial rest mass is μ + m, so the total energy is W = μ + m. But to produce the final state, which requires W ≥ m, but since W must be at least μ + m (because that's the rest mass of the initial particles), then the threshold W is μ + m. Wait, no. Wait, the threshold for a reaction is the minimum CM energy needed for the reaction to occur. For a reaction like π+ + n → γ + p, the minimum W is the sum of the rest masses of the final state particles. Since the photon is massless and the proton has mass m, the threshold W is m. However, the initial particles (π+ and n) have a combined rest mass of μ + m. If μ + m > m, which it is (since μ > 0), then the actual threshold for the reaction is when the CM energy W is equal to the rest mass of the initial particles, because you can't have W less than μ + m in the initial state. Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the center-of-mass frame, the total energy W is the sum of the energies of the initial particles. For the reaction π+ + n → γ + p, the initial particles are π+ and n, each at rest. Then W would be μ + m. But if they are moving, W can be higher. However, the threshold for the reaction is the minimum W required for the reaction to proceed. But since the initial particles are π+ and n, their rest frame has W = μ + m. To produce the final state γ + p, which has a rest mass of m (since γ is massless), the minimum W required is m. But since the initial W is μ + m, which is greater than m (assuming μ is positive), the reaction is always above threshold. Wait, this can't be right. There's a mistake here.\n\nWait, no. The threshold energy for a reaction is determined by the masses of the products. For the reaction π+ + n → γ + p, the products are a photon and a proton. The photon is massless, so the minimum energy required is just the proton's rest mass, m. However, the initial system (π+ and n) has a rest mass of μ + m. Therefore, if μ + m > m, which it is (since μ ≈ 140 MeV, m ≈ 938 MeV), then the initial rest mass is already above the threshold required for the reaction. Therefore, the reaction can proceed even when the initial particles are at rest. But this seems contradictory because the initial rest mass is higher than the threshold. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding threshold.\n\nWait, the threshold is the minimum CM energy W needed for the reaction to occur. For the reaction to happen, the CM energy must be at least the sum of the rest masses of the products. Here, the products are γ (0) + p (m), so threshold W is m. However, the initial particles are π+ (μ) and n (m), so their combined rest mass is μ + m. If μ + m > m, which it is, then the CM energy when the initial particles are at rest is μ + m, which is greater than the threshold. Therefore, the reaction can proceed even at the minimal CM energy, which is μ + m. Wait, no. The CM energy is determined by the initial particles' energies. If the initial particles are moving, the CM energy can be higher, but if they are at rest, the CM energy is just their rest mass sum. Therefore, the minimal possible W for the reaction π+ + n → γ + p is μ + m, which is already above the threshold W = m. Therefore, the actual threshold W for reaction II is W = m, but since the initial particles cannot have W less than μ + m, the reaction is only possible when W ≥ μ + m. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.\n\nThe threshold for a reaction is the minimum CM energy required for the reaction to occur. For the reaction π+ + n → γ + p, the final state has a proton (mass m) and a photon (mass 0). The minimum energy required is m. However, the initial state consists of a π+ (mass μ) and a neutron (mass m). The total rest mass of the initial state is μ + m. Therefore, in the CM frame, the total energy W must be at least μ + m. But to produce the final state, which requires W ≥ m, but since μ + m > m, the actual threshold W for reaction II is W = μ + m. Because you can't have the CM energy less than μ + m when the initial particles are π+ and n. Therefore, the threshold W is μ + m. Wait, that makes sense. Because the initial particles have a combined rest mass of μ + m, so the minimum possible W is μ + m. But the final state requires W ≥ m. Since μ + m > m, the threshold W for reaction II is μ + m. Therefore, the reaction can only occur when W ≥ μ + m. But wait, that can't be right. Because if you have a pion and neutron at rest, their total energy is μ + m, which is higher than the threshold required for the final state (m). Therefore, the reaction is possible even at W = μ + m, which is above the final state's threshold. Therefore, the threshold W for reaction II is W = μ + m. But wait, that seems contradictory. Let me check with an example.\n\nSuppose the pion mass μ is 140 MeV, and the nucleon mass m is 938 MeV. Then μ + m = 1078 MeV. The final state requires W ≥ 938 MeV. But the initial state's rest mass is 1078 MeV, so the reaction can only occur when W ≥ 1078 MeV. Therefore, the threshold W is 1078 MeV. But that would mean that the reaction cannot occur at lower W, even though the final state only requires 938 MeV. This is because the initial particles' rest mass is already higher than the final state's required energy. Therefore, the threshold W for reaction II is indeed μ + m. Because in the CM frame, the total energy W is determined by the initial particles' energies. If they are at rest, W = μ + m. To have W lower than μ + m, the initial particles would have to be moving in opposite directions with some kinetic energy, but that's not possible because their rest mass already sums to μ + m. Therefore, the minimum W for reaction II is μ + m, which is the threshold.\n\nTherefore, W_thresh = μ + m.\n\nNow, how does σ_II(W) behave just above threshold? Near threshold, the cross section often depends on the phase space available. The cross section is proportional to the square of the amplitude multiplied by the phase space factor. Near threshold, the phase space is limited, so the cross section tends to rise from zero. The phase space for a two-body final state (γ + p) is proportional to the momentum of the final state particles in the CM frame.\n\nBut wait, the final state is two-body: γ and p. The phase space for a two-body reaction is proportional to p_final / W^2, where p_final is the momentum of one of the particles in the CM frame. But for the reaction π+ + n → γ + p, the final state is γ and p. The photon is massless, so the momentum of the proton in the CM frame can be calculated.\n\nIn the CM frame, the final state particles (γ and p) must have equal and opposite momenta. The energy of the proton is sqrt(p^2 + m^2), and the energy of the photon is p (since it's massless). The total energy W is:\n\nsqrt(p^2 + m^2) + p = W\n\nSolving for p:\n\nsqrt(p^2 + m^2) = W - p\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\np^2 + m^2 = W^2 - 2Wp + p^2\n\nCancel p^2:\n\nm^2 = W^2 - 2Wp\n\n=> 2Wp = W^2 - m^2\n\n=> p = (W^2 - m^2)/(2W)\n\nTherefore, the momentum of the proton (and photon) in the final state is p = (W^2 - m^2)/(2W)\n\nThe phase space factor for a two-body reaction is proportional to p_final / W^2. But the cross section near threshold would depend on this phase space. However, since the reaction is π+ + n → γ + p, and the final state has two particles, the cross section just above threshold (W = μ + m) would depend on the available phase space. But wait, at W = μ + m, which is the threshold, the final state momentum p would be:\n\np = ( (μ + m)^2 - m^2 ) / (2(μ + m)) ) = ( μ^2 + 2μm ) / (2(μ + m)) ) = μ(μ + 2m) / (2(μ + m)) )\n\nBut simplifying:\n\nμ(μ + 2m) / [2(μ + m)] ) = [ μ/(2) ) ] * [ (μ + 2m)/(μ + m) ) ]\n\nBut near threshold, W is just slightly above μ + m. Wait, no. Wait, the threshold is W = μ + m. So just above threshold, W = μ + m + ε, where ε is small. But wait, no. Wait, the threshold for reaction II is W = μ + m, because that's the minimum W possible for the initial state. But the final state requires W ≥ m, but since the initial state's W is μ + m, which is greater than m, the reaction can proceed. However, the phase space for the final state depends on W. But since the initial state's W is fixed at μ + m (if the particles are at rest), but in reality, the initial particles can have kinetic energy, so W can be larger than μ + m. Wait, no. The CM energy W is determined by the initial particles' energies. If the pion and neutron are moving towards each other with some kinetic energy, then W will be greater than μ + m. But the threshold for the reaction is when W is just enough to produce the final state. But since the final state requires W ≥ m, and the initial state's minimum W is μ + m, which is greater than m, the reaction can occur for any W ≥ μ + m. Therefore, the threshold W for reaction II is W = μ + m.\n\nNow, just above this threshold (W = μ + m + ε, ε small), how does σ_II(W) behave? The cross section is proportional to the square of the matrix element multiplied by the phase space factor. Assuming that the matrix element doesn't vary rapidly near threshold, the cross section's behavior is dominated by the phase space.\n\nFor the two-body final state, the phase space is proportional to p_final, where p_final is the momentum of the proton (or photon) in the CM frame. As calculated earlier, p_final = (W^2 - m^2)/(2W)\n\nBut at W = μ + m, substituting:\n\np_final = [ ( (μ + m)^2 - m^2 ) ] / (2(μ + m)) )\n\n= [ μ^2 + 2μm + m^2 - m^2 ] / (2(μ + m)) )\n\n= μ(μ + 2m) / (2(μ + m)) )\n\nBut this is a constant. Wait, no. Wait, if W is varying, then p_final depends on W. Wait, but in reaction II, the initial state is π+ + n, so W is the CM energy which can vary if the initial particles have kinetic energy. But when we talk about the threshold for reaction II, it's the minimum W required for the reaction to occur. But since the initial particles can have kinetic energy, W can be larger than μ + m. However, the threshold is W = m for the final state, but since the initial state's minimum W is μ + m, which is greater than m, the actual threshold for reaction II is W = μ + m. Therefore, when W is just above μ + m, how does σ_II behave?\n\nWait, no. Let me correct this. The threshold for a reaction is the minimum CM energy required for the reaction to occur. For reaction II (π+ + n → γ + p), the final state is γ + p. The minimum CM energy required is the sum of their rest masses, which is m (since γ is massless). However, the initial state is π+ + n, which has a rest mass of μ + m. Therefore, the CM energy W cannot be less than μ + m. Therefore, the reaction can only occur when W ≥ μ + m. But since μ + m > m, the threshold W for reaction II is W = μ + m. Therefore, the reaction is only possible when W ≥ μ + m, and the threshold is W = μ + m.\n\nNow, just above this threshold (W = μ + m + ε), how does σ_II(W) behave? The cross section for the inverse reaction (which is reaction I: γ + p → π+ + n) would have a certain behavior, and via detailed balance, σ_II is related to σ_I. But perhaps we can analyze it directly.\n\nThe cross section near threshold for a two-body reaction typically depends on the phase space available. For a two-body final state, the phase space is proportional to the momentum of the final particles. However, in this case, the reaction II is a two-body to two-body process. Wait, no: reaction II is π+ + n → γ + p, which is a two-body initial state to two-body final state. The phase space for a two-body final state is constant, but the cross section can still depend on the matrix element and possible threshold effects.\n\nWait, but for two-body reactions, the cross section doesn't necessarily vanish at threshold. However, in many cases, the cross section rises abruptly at threshold. But for the reaction π+ + n → γ + p, which is the inverse of γ + p → π+ + n, the cross section might have a certain behavior.\n\nAlternatively, using the result from part (a), we can express σ_II in terms of σ_I. If near threshold (W ≈ μ + m), we can analyze how σ_II behaves.\n\nFrom part (a):\n\nσ_II(W) = σ_I(W) * [3 (W^2 - m^2)^2 ] / [ (W^2 - (μ + m)^2)(W^2 - (μ - m)^2) ) ]\n\nAt W = μ + m + ε, with ε small. Let's expand the denominator and numerator around W = μ + m.\n\nFirst, compute the denominator:\n\nD = (W^2 - (μ + m)^2)(W^2 - (μ - m)^2)\n\nAt W = μ + m + ε, W^2 ≈ (μ + m)^2 + 2(μ + m)ε\n\nSo W^2 - (μ + m", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0}
{"id": "atomic/4-21", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the energy a single proton must have when colliding with a stationary proton to achieve the same center-of-mass (CMS) energy as two protons colliding head-on each with 30 GeV of total energy. Hmm, let me start by recalling some concepts from relativistic collisions.\n\nFirst, in particle physics, the center-of-mass energy is crucial because it determines what kinds of particles can be produced in the collision. When particles collide head-on, especially in colliders like at CERN, the CMS energy is higher compared to when one particle is stationary (like in a fixed-target experiment). The problem here is comparing these two scenarios: one where both protons are moving towards each other with 30 GeV each, and another where one is stationary and the other has some energy E, such that the CMS energy in both cases is the same.\n\nLet me write down the formula for the center-of-mass energy squared, s. In general, for two particles with four-momenta p1 and p2, s is given by:\n\ns = (p1 + p2)^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2\n\nBut since in the collider case, they are moving head-on, their momenta are in opposite directions. Let's consider the lab frame where one proton is stationary. Wait, no, first handle the collider case.\n\nIn the collider case, both protons have energy 30 GeV. Since protons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta vectors are opposite. Let's work in natural units where c=1 for simplicity. Then, the total energy in the CMS frame is the sum of the energies of both protons. Wait, no, actually, the CMS energy squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2. But since they are moving in opposite directions, the vector sum of their momenta would be p1 - p2 (assuming p2 is in the opposite direction). But if both protons have the same energy, their momenta magnitudes would be the same? Wait, but protons have rest mass, so their momentum isn't just E/c divided by velocity. Hmm, maybe I need to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.\n\nWait, the total energy of each proton is 30 GeV. The rest mass energy of a proton is about 0.938 GeV, so they are highly relativistic. But even so, their momentum can be calculated using E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Since they are moving in opposite directions, the total momentum in the lab frame (the collider frame) would be p1 - p2. But if both protons have the same speed but opposite directions, then their momenta would be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, so total momentum would be zero. Wait, but that's only if they have the same speed. But in reality, in a collider, the two beams might have the same energy, so same magnitude of momentum? Wait, but if they have the same energy, but opposite directions, then their momenta vectors would cancel each other out. Therefore, the total momentum in the collider frame is zero, so the CMS frame is the same as the lab frame. Therefore, the CMS energy squared is just (E1 + E2)^2. Since E1 = E2 = 30 GeV, then s = (60 GeV)^2 = 3600 GeV².\n\nNow, in the fixed-target case, where one proton is stationary (lab frame), and the other has energy E. We need to find E such that the CMS energy squared s is also 3600 GeV².\n\nIn this scenario, the target proton is at rest, so its energy is just its rest mass energy, m c² = 0.938 GeV. The moving proton has energy E, which is its total energy (rest mass plus kinetic). The four-momentum of the moving proton is (E, p), and the stationary proton is (m c², 0). The total energy is E + m c², and the total momentum is p (since the stationary proton has zero momentum). Then, the CMS energy squared is:\n\ns = (E + m c²)^2 - (p c)^2\n\nBut we need this to equal 3600 GeV². Let's compute this expression. Also, using the energy-momentum relation for the moving proton: E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. Therefore, (p c)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2. Substitute this into the expression for s:\n\ns = (E + m c²)^2 - (E² - (m c²)^2)\n= E² + 2 E m c² + (m c²)^2 - E² + (m c²)^2\n= 2 E m c² + 2 (m c²)^2\n\nSo,\n\ns = 2 m c² (E + m c²)\n\nWe set this equal to 3600 GeV²:\n\n2 m c² (E + m c²) = 3600 GeV²\n\nWe can solve for E:\n\nE + m c² = 3600 GeV² / (2 m c²)\n\nTherefore,\n\nE = (3600 GeV² / (2 m c²)) - m c²\n\nPlugging in m c² = 0.938 GeV:\n\nE = (3600 / (2 * 0.938)) - 0.938\n\nFirst compute 3600 / (2 * 0.938):\n\n2 * 0.938 = 1.876\n\n3600 / 1.876 ≈ 3600 / 1.876 ≈ let's calculate that:\n\n1.876 * 1000 = 1876\n\n3600 / 1876 ≈ 1.918, but since we have 3600 / 1.876, it's 3600 divided by approximately 1.876. Let me compute this more accurately.\n\n1.876 * 1918 = ?\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute 3600 divided by 1.876:\n\n1.876 × 1900 = 1.876 × 2000 - 1.876 × 100 = 3752 - 187.6 = 3564.4\n\nThat's 1900. Then 3600 - 3564.4 = 35.6. So 35.6 / 1.876 ≈ 19. So total is approximately 1900 + 19 = 1919 GeV. Wait, but that seems way too high. Wait, but 1.876 times 1919 is 1.876*1900 + 1.876*19 = 3564.4 + 35.644 = 3600.044. So yes, 3600 / 1.876 ≈ 1919 GeV.\n\nSo E ≈ 1919 GeV - 0.938 GeV ≈ 1918.06 GeV.\n\nWait, that's about 1918 GeV. But that seems extremely high. But considering that in fixed target experiments, the energy required to reach the same CMS energy as a collider is much higher. For example, in electron-positron colliders, the CMS energy is 2E if they collide head-on each with energy E. If you have a fixed target, the required energy would be roughly (s)/(2m), which for s=(2E)^2=4E², so fixed target energy would be (4E²)/(2m) = 2E²/m. Since m is the mass of the proton, which is ~1 GeV, so if E is 30 GeV, then 2*(30)^2 /1 = 1800 GeV, which is 1.8 TeV, which is in the same ballpark as our previous result. So 1918 GeV is approximately 1.9 TeV, which is close. The difference is because in the previous simplified calculation, we assumed E >> m, so approximate. But here, we did the exact calculation.\n\nSo the answer is approximately 1918 GeV, or 1.918 TeV. But let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, s = 3600 GeV². So:\n\nE = (3600 / (2 * 0.938)) - 0.938\n\nCompute 3600 divided by (2 * 0.938):\n\nFirst, 2 * 0.938 = 1.876\n\n3600 / 1.876 = ?\n\nLet me compute 3600 / 1.876:\n\n1.876 * 1000 = 1876\n\n3600 / 1876 ≈ 1.918 (since 1876*1.918 ≈ 1876*(2 - 0.082) = 3752 - 1876*0.082 ≈ 3752 - 153.8 ≈ 3598.2, which is close to 3600). So 3600 / 1.876 ≈ 1918. So E ≈ 1918 - 0.938 ≈ 1917.06 GeV.\n\nSo approximately 1917 GeV. So the answer is about 1917 GeV. But let me check with more precise calculation.\n\nLet me compute 3600 divided by 1.876:\n\n1.876 × 1918 = 1.876 × 1900 + 1.876 × 18 = 3564.4 + 33.768 = 3598.168\n\nWhich is 3598.168, which is 1.832 GeV less than 3600. So the exact value would be 1918 + (3600 - 3598.168)/1.876 ≈ 1918 + 1.832 /1.876 ≈ 1918 + 0.977 ≈ 1918.977. So approximately 1919 GeV. Then subtract 0.938 GeV: 1919 - 0.938 ≈ 1918.06 GeV.\n\nSo the precise answer is approximately 1918 GeV. Therefore, the single proton must have an energy of approximately 1918 GeV to achieve the same CMS energy as two 30 GeV protons colliding head-on.\n\nBut let me check if there's another approach. Alternatively, using the formula for the center-of-mass energy in fixed target experiments. The CMS energy squared is given by:\n\ns = 2 m c^2 (E_lab + m c^2)\n\nWhere E_lab is the total energy (rest mass + kinetic) of the incoming proton, and m c^2 is the rest energy of the target proton. We set s equal to (60 GeV)^2 = 3600 GeV². Then:\n\n3600 = 2 * 0.938 * (E + 0.938)\n\nSolving for E:\n\nDivide both sides by 2 * 0.938:\n\n3600 / (2 * 0.938) = E + 0.938\n\nWhich is the same as before. So E = (3600 / 1.876) - 0.938 ≈ 1918.06 GeV.\n\nYes, so the answer is approximately 1918 GeV. Therefore, the energy required is about 1918 GeV. Since the problem might expect an exact answer, but given that the proton rest mass is 0.938 GeV, perhaps we need to keep more decimals. However, in exams, sometimes approximate values are used. But let's do the exact calculation with more precision.\n\nLet me use more precise numbers. Let's take m c² = 0.938272 GeV (the actual proton rest mass).\n\nCompute 2 * m c² = 2 * 0.938272 = 1.876544\n\nThen, 3600 / 1.876544 = ?\n\nLet me compute this division step by step.\n\n1.876544 * 1900 = 1.876544 * 1000 + 1.876544 * 900 = 1876.544 + 1688.8896 = 3565.4336\n\nSubtract this from 3600: 3600 - 3565.4336 = 34.5664\n\nNow, divide 34.5664 by 1.876544:\n\n1.876544 * 18 = 33.777792\n\n34.5664 - 33.777792 = 0.788608\n\n0.788608 / 1.876544 ≈ 0.42024\n\nSo total is 1900 + 18 + 0.42024 ≈ 1918.42024\n\nTherefore, 3600 / 1.876544 ≈ 1918.42024\n\nThen subtract m c² = 0.938272:\n\n1918.42024 - 0.938272 ≈ 1917.48197 GeV\n\nSo approximately 1917.48 GeV. Rounding to a reasonable number of significant figures, since the given energy is 30 GeV (two significant figures), but the rest mass is known more precisely. However, the answer is likely expected to be in the order of 1.9 x 10^3 GeV, so 1900 GeV. But given that the precise calculation gives ~1917 GeV, which is approximately 1.92 x 10^3 GeV. But maybe the problem expects an exact answer in terms of symbols, but since it's numerical, we need to compute it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach using the invariance of the Mandelstam variable s. In the collider case, s is (p1 + p2)^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 - p2)^2 (since they are moving in opposite directions). But since E1 = E2 = 30 GeV, and p1 = p2 (since same energy and opposite directions), then (p1 - p2) would be 2p1 (if p2 is in the negative direction). Wait, no, if they are moving in opposite directions with the same magnitude of momentum, then total momentum is zero. Therefore, s = (E1 + E2)^2 = (60)^2 = 3600 GeV².\n\nIn the fixed target case, s is (E + m)^2 - p^2, where E is the energy of the moving proton, m is the rest mass of the target proton, and p is the momentum of the moving proton. Then, using E^2 = p^2 + m^2, so p^2 = E^2 - m^2. Therefore, s = (E + m)^2 - (E^2 - m^2) = E^2 + 2Em + m^2 - E^2 + m^2 = 2Em + 2m^2 = 2m(E + m). Setting this equal to 3600 GeV²:\n\n2m(E + m) = 3600\n\nSo E + m = 3600/(2m) = 1800/m\n\nTherefore, E = 1800/m - m\n\nPlugging in m = 0.938272 GeV:\n\nE = 1800 / 0.938272 - 0.938272 ≈ 1918.42 - 0.938 ≈ 1917.48 GeV\n\nSame result as before. So the exact answer is approximately 1917.5 GeV. Depending on rounding, this could be 1918 GeV or 1917 GeV. But given that the rest mass is about 0.938 GeV, and the problem states \"total energy 30 GeV\" for the colliding protons, which is presumably their kinetic energy plus rest mass. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the problem says \"protons of total energy 30 GeV collide head-on\". So total energy is 30 GeV each, meaning each proton's total energy (rest energy + kinetic energy) is 30 GeV. So in that case, the rest energy is 0.938 GeV, so their kinetic energy is about 29.062 GeV each. But in the collider case, the total energy per proton is 30 GeV. So when calculating the CMS energy, we have each proton contributing 30 GeV, so total energy 60 GeV, and since their momenta cancel, the CMS energy is 60 GeV. Therefore, s = (60 GeV)^2 = 3600 GeV².\n\nIn the fixed target case, we need to find the energy E (total energy) of the incoming proton such that s = 3600 GeV². As we calculated, E ≈ 1917.5 GeV. So the answer is approximately 1918 GeV.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. The relation between the CMS energy and the lab frame energy in fixed target experiments can be given by:\n\nsqrt(s) = sqrt(2 m c^2 * E_lab)\n\nBut this is an approximation when E_lab >> m c^2. However, in reality, the exact formula is sqrt(s) = sqrt(2 m c^2 (E_lab + m c^2)). So if we set sqrt(s) = 60 GeV, then:\n\n60 = sqrt(2 * 0.938 * (E + 0.938))\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n3600 = 2 * 0.938 * (E + 0.938)\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. So solving for E gives the same result. Therefore, the energy required is approximately 1918 GeV.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 1918 GeV. So the single proton must have an energy of about 1918 GeV to achieve the same CMS energy as two 30 GeV protons colliding head-on.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the energy a single proton must have when colliding with a stationary proton to achieve the same center-of-mass (CMS) energy as two 30 GeV protons colliding head-on:\n\n1. **Collider Case**:  \n   Each proton has total energy \\( E = 30 \\, \\text{GeV} \\).

{"id": "atomic/3-7", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this physics problem. The question is about a state containing only one strange particle and whether certain statements about its decay or creation are possible. The options are (a) it can decay into a state of zero strangeness, (b) it can be created strongly from a state of zero strangeness, and (c) it cannot exist. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some concepts about strangeness and particle interactions. Strangeness is a quantum number introduced to explain the behavior of certain particles, like kaons and lambda particles, which were produced via the strong interaction but decayed via the weak interaction. The key thing here is that strangeness is conserved in strong interactions but not in weak interactions.\n\nSo, the problem states a particle with only one strange particle. Let's parse that. If the state has one strange particle, that means its strangeness quantum number S is either +1 or -1, depending on the particle. For example, a kaon (K+) has strangeness +1, and an anti-kaon (K-) has -1. Similarly, a lambda particle has S = -1.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\n(a) Can it decay into a state of zero strangeness? Decay processes typically involve the weak interaction because if the particle is decaying, it's changing its quark composition, which usually requires a change in strangeness. But in weak interactions, strangeness isn't conserved. So, for example, a kaon (S=+1) can decay into pions (which have S=0). But wait, the question is about the entire state. If the initial state has one strange particle (so total S=+1 or -1), can it decay into a state with total S=0? Since decay is via the weak force, which doesn't conserve strangeness, yes, that's possible. So option (a) seems possible. For example, K+ → π+ π0. The initial S=+1, final S=0. So (a) is allowed.\n\n(b) Can it be created strongly from a state of zero strangeness? Strong interactions conserve strangeness. So if the initial state has S=0, then the final state after a strong interaction must also have S=0. But the problem states the created state has one strange particle, so S=+1 or -1. Therefore, creating such a state via strong interaction from S=0 would violate strangeness conservation. Hence, (b) is not possible. Wait, but wait—wait a second. When particles like kaons are produced in strong interactions, they are produced in pairs. For example, in a collision of two non-strange particles, like protons and pions, you can produce a lambda and a kaon, which together have S=0. But if you have a state with only one strange particle, that would mean S=+1 or -1. But strong interactions require that the total strangeness is conserved. So if you start with S=0, you can't end up with S=+1 or -1. Therefore, you can't create a single strange particle via strong interaction from a state with zero strangeness. So (b) is not allowed. So option (b) is incorrect.\n\n(c) Cannot exist. But we know that particles like kaons, lambdas, etc., do exist as single strange particles. So (c) is not correct. Unless the question is referring to a state with only one strange particle, but maybe in some context where it's impossible. But in reality, particles with S=±1 do exist. So (c) is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be (a). But wait, let me double-check. For example, when a strange particle decays, does it have to change strangeness by ±1? Let me recall the selection rules. In weak decays, the change in strangeness can be ΔS=0, ±1. But for example, the decay K+ → π+ π0. The K+ has S=+1, and the pions have S=0. So ΔS = -1, which is allowed in weak interactions. So yes, (a) is possible. Therefore, the answer is (a).\n</think>\n\nA state containing a single strange particle (with strangeness \\( S = \\pm1 \\)) can decay into a state of zero strangeness via the **weak interaction**, which does not conserve strangeness. For example, a \\( K^+ \\) (strangeness \\( +1 \\)) can decay into pions (\\( \\pi^+ \\pi^0 \\)), which have \\( S = 0 \\). However, **strong interactions** conserve strangeness, so a single strange particle cannot be created from a state of zero strangeness through strong processes. Additionally, single strange particles (e.g., kaons, lambda particles) are known to exist, ruling out option (c).  \n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{a}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["a"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "a", "expr2": "(a)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "a", "expr2": "a"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/4-28", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the special value of the incident K⁻ energy such that the Λ⁰ is produced at rest in the laboratory. Hmm, let's start by recalling some conservation laws here. Since this is a particle reaction, both energy and momentum should be conserved. The target proton is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. The K⁻ meson is incident with some energy, and after the collision, we have a π⁰ and a Λ⁰. The key here is that the Λ⁰ is produced at rest in the lab frame. That means the Λ⁰ has no momentum after the reaction. So, the π⁰ must carry away all the momentum from the K⁻, right? Wait, but the proton was initially at rest, so the total initial momentum is just the momentum of the K⁻. Therefore, after the collision, the total momentum should still be equal to the initial K⁻ momentum. But if the Λ⁰ is at rest, then the π⁰ must have all the momentum. Hmm, but how does that work with energy conservation?\n\nLet me write down the conservation equations. Let's denote the rest masses as m_K (for K⁻), m_p (proton), m_π (pi zero), and m_Λ (Lambda zero). The initial energy is the energy of the K⁻ plus the rest energy of the proton. The final energy is the energy of the π⁰ plus the rest energy of the Λ⁰ (since it's at rest). The initial momentum is just the momentum of the K⁻, and the final momentum is the momentum of the π⁰. So, momentum conservation tells us that the momentum of the K⁻ (p_K) must equal the momentum of the π⁰ (p_π). Energy conservation tells us that the total initial energy (E_K + m_p c²) equals the total final energy (E_π + m_Λ c²). But since we're working in natural units where c=1, maybe I can ignore c² terms? Wait, the problem doesn't specify units, but since masses are given, I should probably keep them as m terms with appropriate factors. Let me check.\n\nWait, in particle physics, it's common to use natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, so energy, mass, and momentum are all in units of GeV or MeV. So, energy conservation would be E_K + m_p = E_π + m_Λ. Momentum conservation is p_K = p_π. Because the proton is at rest, initial momentum is all from the K⁻. Then, the Λ⁰ is at rest, so its momentum is zero, so the π⁰ must carry the entire momentum. So, p_π = p_K.\n\nNow, the energy of the K⁻ is related to its momentum and mass by E_K = sqrt(p_K² + m_K²). Similarly, the energy of the π⁰ is E_π = sqrt(p_π² + m_π²). But since p_π = p_K, we can write E_π = sqrt(p_K² + m_π²). Then, substituting into energy conservation:\n\nsqrt(p_K² + m_K²) + m_p = sqrt(p_K² + m_π²) + m_Λ.\n\nHmm, so this equation relates p_K to the masses. If I can solve for p_K, then I can find the energy of the K⁻. Let's square both sides to eliminate the square roots. Let me denote sqrt(p_K² + m_K²) as E_K for simplicity. Then:\n\nE_K + m_p = sqrt(p_K² + m_π²) + m_Λ.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\nE_K + m_p - m_Λ = sqrt(p_K² + m_π²).\n\nNow, square both sides:\n\n(E_K + m_p - m_Λ)² = p_K² + m_π².\n\nBut E_K is sqrt(p_K² + m_K²), so substitute that in:\n\n[sqrt(p_K² + m_K²) + m_p - m_Λ]^2 = p_K² + m_π².\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n(p_K² + m_K²) + (m_p - m_Λ)^2 + 2 sqrt(p_K² + m_K²)(m_p - m_Λ) = p_K² + m_π².\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\np_K² + m_K² + (m_p - m_Λ)^2 + 2 (m_p - m_Λ) sqrt(p_K² + m_K²) = p_K² + m_π².\n\nCancel p_K² on both sides:\n\nm_K² + (m_p - m_Λ)^2 + 2 (m_p - m_Λ) sqrt(p_K² + m_K²) = m_π².\n\nLet me move the terms not involving the square root to the right side:\n\n2 (m_p - m_Λ) sqrt(p_K² + m_K²) = m_π² - m_K² - (m_p - m_Λ)^2.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2 (m_p - m_Λ):\n\nsqrt(p_K² + m_K²) = [m_π² - m_K² - (m_p - m_Λ)^2] / [2 (m_p - m_Λ)].\n\nBut sqrt(p_K² + m_K²) is E_K, the energy of the K⁻. So,\n\nE_K = [m_π² - m_K² - (m_p - m_Λ)^2] / [2 (m_p - m_Λ)].\n\nWait, but this seems a bit complicated. Let me check the algebra again. Maybe I made a mistake in expanding the square.\n\nWait, original equation after moving terms:\n\nLeft side after expansion: p_K² + m_K² + (m_p - m_Λ)^2 + 2 (m_p - m_Λ) sqrt(p_K² + m_K²) = p_K² + m_π².\n\nSubtract p_K² from both sides:\n\nm_K² + (m_p - m_Λ)^2 + 2 (m_p - m_Λ) sqrt(p_K² + m_K²) = m_π².\n\nThen, moving m_K² and (m_p - m_Λ)^2 to the right:\n\n2 (m_p - m_Λ) sqrt(p_K² + m_K²) = m_π² - m_K² - (m_p - m_Λ)^2.\n\nYes, that's correct. Then solving for sqrt(p_K² + m_K²):\n\nsqrt(p_K² + m_K²) = [m_π² - m_K² - (m_p - m_Λ)^2] / [2 (m_p - m_Λ)].\n\nBut sqrt(p_K² + m_K²) is E_K, so:\n\nE_K = [m_π² - m_K² - (m_p - m_Λ)^2] / [2 (m_p - m_Λ)].\n\nBut wait, the denominator is 2 (m_p - m_Λ). Let me check the signs here. If m_p - m_Λ is negative, then the denominator is negative, but the left side E_K is positive. So, perhaps m_Λ is larger than m_p? Let me recall the masses. The proton mass is about 938 MeV, Λ⁰ is about 1115 MeV, so m_Λ > m_p. Therefore, m_p - m_Λ is negative. So denominator is negative. Then, the numerator: m_π² - m_K² - (m_p - m_Λ)^2. Let's see, m_π is about 135 MeV, m_K is around 494 MeV. So m_π² is much smaller than m_K². So numerator would be (135)^2 - (494)^2 - (938 - 1115)^2. Let's compute that approximately. 135² = 18,225, 494² ≈ 244,036, (938 - 1115) = -177, so squared is 31,329. So numerator ≈ 18,225 - 244,036 - 31,329 ≈ -257,140. Denominator is 2*(938 - 1115) = 2*(-177) = -354. So E_K ≈ (-257,140)/(-354) ≈ 726 MeV. But the actual K⁻ rest mass is 494 MeV, so E_K must be greater than that. 726 MeV is higher than rest mass, so kinetic energy is about 726 - 494 = 232 MeV. But this is just a numerical check. However, the problem asks for the answer in terms of the masses. So perhaps we can rearrange the equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better approach. Let me think again. Since the Λ⁰ is produced at rest, in the lab frame, the total momentum after collision is just the momentum of the π⁰. But the initial momentum is the momentum of the K⁻. Therefore, p_K = p_π. So, the momenta are equal. Let's denote p = p_K = p_π.\n\nEnergy conservation: E_K + m_p = E_π + m_Λ.\n\nBut E_K = sqrt(p² + m_K²), E_π = sqrt(p² + m_π²). So:\n\nsqrt(p² + m_K²) + m_p = sqrt(p² + m_π²) + m_Λ.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\nsqrt(p² + m_K²) - sqrt(p² + m_π²) = m_Λ - m_p.\n\nLet me denote the left side as difference of two square roots. Let me call this difference D = sqrt(p² + m_K²) - sqrt(p² + m_π²) = m_Λ - m_p.\n\nTo solve for p, perhaps square both sides. But squaring when there's a difference can be tricky. Let me set A = sqrt(p² + m_K²), B = sqrt(p² + m_π²). Then, A - B = m_Λ - m_p. Then, A = B + (m_Λ - m_p). Then, square both sides:\n\nA² = B² + 2 B (m_Λ - m_p) + (m_Λ - m_p)^2.\n\nBut A² = p² + m_K², B² = p² + m_π². Substitute:\n\np² + m_K² = p² + m_π² + 2 B (m_Λ - m_p) + (m_Λ - m_p)^2.\n\nCancel p²:\n\nm_K² = m_π² + 2 B (m_Λ - m_p) + (m_Λ - m_p)^2.\n\nThen, solve for B:\n\n2 B (m_Λ - m_p) = m_K² - m_π² - (m_Λ - m_p)^2.\n\nTherefore,\n\nB = [m_K² - m_π² - (m_Λ - m_p)^2] / [2 (m_Λ - m_p)].\n\nBut B is sqrt(p² + m_π²). So,\n\nsqrt(p² + m_π²) = [m_K² - m_π² - (m_Λ - m_p)^2] / [2 (m_Λ - m_p)].\n\nThen, square both sides to solve for p²:\n\np² + m_π² = [ (m_K² - m_π² - (m_Λ - m_p)^2 ) / (2 (m_Λ - m_p)) ]².\n\nTherefore,\n\np² = [ (m_K² - m_π² - (m_Λ - m_p)^2 ) / (2 (m_Λ - m_p)) ]² - m_π².\n\nThis expression gives p² in terms of the masses. However, we need to find the energy of the K⁻, which is E_K = sqrt(p² + m_K²). So, once we have p², we can compute E_K. But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a way to express E_K directly in terms of the masses.\n\nAlternatively, let's recall that in the center-of-momentum frame, but the problem is in the lab frame. Wait, but maybe using invariant quantities could help. The invariant Mandelstam variable s is the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame. But perhaps that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the energy and momentum conservation equations again. Let me write them down:\n\n1. E_K + m_p = E_π + m_Λ. (Energy conservation)\n2. p_K = p_π. (Momentum conservation)\n\nFrom equation 2, p_π = p_K = p.\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes:\n\nsqrt(p² + m_K²) + m_p = sqrt(p² + m_π²) + m_Λ.\n\nLet me rearrange this as:\n\nsqrt(p² + m_K²) - sqrt(p² + m_π²) = m_Λ - m_p.\n\nLet me denote delta = m_Λ - m_p. Then,\n\nsqrt(p² + m_K²) - sqrt(p² + m_π²) = delta.\n\nLet me call sqrt(p² + m_K²) = A and sqrt(p² + m_π²) = B. Then, A - B = delta. Also, A² - B² = m_K² - m_π². But A² - B² = (A - B)(A + B) = delta (A + B) = m_K² - m_π². Therefore,\n\ndelta (A + B) = m_K² - m_π².\n\nBut A + B = (sqrt(p² + m_K²) + sqrt(p² + m_π²)). However, from equation 1, A + m_p = B + m_Λ. So, A - B = m_Λ - m_p = delta. Wait, but we already have A - B = delta. So, from equation 1: A + m_p = B + m_Λ. Therefore, A - B = m_Λ - m_p = delta. Which is consistent.\n\nBut from A² - B² = delta (A + B) = m_K² - m_π². So,\n\ndelta (A + B) = m_K² - m_π².\n\nBut from equation 1: A = B + delta. Substitute into A + B:\n\nA + B = (B + delta) + B = 2B + delta.\n\nTherefore,\n\ndelta (2B + delta) = m_K² - m_π².\n\nSo,\n\n2 delta B + delta² = m_K² - m_π².\n\nSolve for B:\n\n2 delta B = m_K² - m_π² - delta².\n\nTherefore,\n\nB = [m_K² - m_π² - delta²] / (2 delta).\n\nBut delta is m_Λ - m_p, so:\n\nB = [m_K² - m_π² - (m_Λ - m_p)^2] / [2 (m_Λ - m_p)].\n\nBut B is sqrt(p² + m_π²). So,\n\nsqrt(p² + m_π²) = [m_K² - m_π² - (m_Λ - m_p)^2] / [2 (m_Λ - m_p)].\n\nThen, square both sides:\n\np² + m_π² = [ (m_K² - m_π² - (m_Λ - m_p)^2 ) / (2 (m_Λ - m_p)) ]².\n\nTherefore,\n\np² = [ (m_K² - m_π² - (m_Λ - m_p)^2 ) / (2 (m_Λ - m_p)) ]² - m_π².\n\nThis gives p² in terms of the masses. Then, E_K is sqrt(p² + m_K²). Let's compute E_K:\n\nE_K = sqrt(p² + m_K²) = sqrt( [ (m_K² - m_π² - (m_Λ - m_p)^2 )² / (4 (m_Λ - m_p)^2 ) ] - m_π² + m_K² ).\n\nWait, no. Wait, p² is equal to [ (m_K² - m_π² - (m_Λ - m_p)^2 ) / (2 (m_Λ - m_p)) ]² - m_π². So,\n\nE_K = sqrt( [ (m_K² - m_π² - (m_Λ - m_p)^2 )² / (4 (m_Λ - m_p)^2 ) ] - m_π² + m_K² ).\n\nThis seems very complicated. Maybe there's a simplification here. Let's try to combine terms:\n\nLet me denote numerator inside the square as:\n\nNumerator = (m_K² - m_π² - (m_Λ - m_p)^2 )² - 4 (m_Λ - m_p)^2 m_π².\n\nThen,\n\nE_K = sqrt( [Numerator] / [4 (m_Λ - m_p)^2 ] + m_K² ).\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express p²:\n\np² = [ (m_K² - m_π² - (m_Λ - m_p)^2 ) / (2 (m_Λ - m_p)) ]² - m_π².\n\nSo,\n\np² + m_K² = [ (m_K² - m_π² - (m_Λ - m_p)^2 )² / (4 (m_Λ - m_p)^2 ) ] - m_π² + m_K².\n\nFactor out terms:\n\n= [ (m_K² - m_π² - (m_Λ - m_p)^2 )² - 4 (m_Λ - m_p)^2 m_π² + 4 (m_Λ - m_p)^2 m_K² ] / [4 (m_Λ - m_p)^2 ].\n\nWait, this seems messy. Maybe expanding the numerator:\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\nNumerator = (m_K² - m_π² - (m_Λ - m_p)^2 )² - 4 (m_Λ - m_p)^2 m_π² + 4 (m_Λ - m_p)^2 m_K².\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's recall that E_K is given by:\n\nE_K = [m_π² - m_K² - (m_p - m_Λ)^2 ] / [2 (m_p - m_Λ)].\n\nWait, earlier I had that expression. Wait, but when I checked with numbers, it gave a positive E_K. Let me check the signs again. Since m_p - m_Λ is negative (because m_Λ > m_p), denominator is negative. The numerator: m_π² - m_K² - (m_p - m_Λ)^2. Since m_π is much lighter than K, m_π² is much smaller than m_K², so numerator is negative. So negative divided by negative is positive. So E_K is positive. So that expression is valid.\n\nTherefore, E_K = [m_π² - m_K² - (m_p - m_Λ)^2 ] / [2 (m_p - m_Λ)].\n\nBut m_p - m_Λ = -(m_Λ - m_p), so denominator is -2 (m_Λ - m_p). So,\n\nE_K = [m_π² - m_K² - (m_p - m_Λ)^2 ] / [ -2 (m_Λ - m_p) ].\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by -1:\n\nE_K = [ -m_π² + m_K² + (m_p - m_Λ)^2 ] / [2 (m_Λ - m_p) ].\n\nBut (m_p - m_Λ)^2 = (m_Λ - m_p)^2, so:\n\nE_K = [ m_K² - m_π² + (m_Λ - m_p)^2 ] / [2 (m_Λ - m_p) ].\n\nAh, this looks better. So,\n\nE_K = [ (m_Λ - m_p)^2 + m_K² - m_π² ] / [2 (m_Λ - m_p) ].\n\nTherefore, the energy of the K⁻ is equal to [(m_Λ - m_p)^2 + m_K² - m_π²] divided by twice (m_Λ - m_p). That seems like a plausible expression. Let me check the units. All terms in the numerator are mass squared, denominator is mass, so E_K has units of mass, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, this can be written as:\n\nE_K = [ (m_Λ - m_p)^2 + m_K² - m_π² ] / [2 (m_Λ - m_p) ].\n\nYes. So that's the expression for the energy of the K⁻. Therefore, the special value of the incident K⁻ energy is this expression. Since the problem asks for the answer in terms of the rest masses, this should be the final answer. Let me just verify once more.\n\nStarting from energy and momentum conservation, we derived this expression. The key steps were setting up the equations, substituting the momentum equality, and solving for E_K. The algebra led us to this result, which seems dimensionally consistent. Therefore, the answer should be:\n\nE_K = [ (m_Λ^0 - m_p)^2 + m_K^-² - m_π^0² ] / [2 (m_Λ^0 - m_p) ]\n\nExpressed in terms of the given masses. So boxed, it would be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\frac{(m_{\\Lambda^0} - m_p)^2 + m_{K^-}^2 - m_{\\pi^0}^2}{2(m_{\\Lambda^0} - m_p)} }\n</think>\n\nTo find the special value of the incident \\( K^- \\) energy such that the \\( \\Lambda^0 \\) is produced at rest in the laboratory, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The key steps are:\n\n1. **Momentum Conservation**: The initial momentum of the \\( K^- \\) must equal the final momentum of the \\( \\pi^0 \\), since the \\( \\Lambda^0 \\) is at rest.\n2. **Energy Conservation**: The total initial energy (energy of \\( K^- \\) plus rest energy of the proton) equals the total final energy (energy of \\( \\pi^0 \\) plus rest energy of \\( \\Lambda^0 \\)).\n\nUsing these conservation laws, we derive the energy of the \\( K^- \\) (\\( E_K \\)) in terms of the rest masses \\( m_{\\pi^0} \\), \\( m_{K^-} \\), \\( m_p \\), and \\( m_{\\Lambda^0} \\):\n\n\\[\nE_K = \\frac{(m_{\\Lambda^0} - m_p)^2 + m_{K^-}^2 - m_{\\pi^0}^2}{2(m_{\\Lambda^0} - m_p)}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{ \\frac{(m_{\\Lambda^0} - m_p)^2 + m_{K^-}^2 - m_{\\pi^0}^2}{2(m_{\\Lambda^0} - m_p)} }\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\frac{(m_{\\Lambda^0} - m_p)^2 + m_{K^-}^2 - m_{\\pi^0}^2}{2(m_{\\Lambda^0} - m_p)}", "\\frac{(m_{\\Lambda^0} - m_p)^2 + m_{K^-}^2 - m_{\\pi^0}^2}{2(m_{\\Lambda^0} - m_p)}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{(m_{\\Lambda^0} - m_p)^2 + m_{K^-}^2 - m_{\\pi^0}^2}{2(m_{\\Lambda^0} - m_p)}", "expr2": "E_K = \\frac{m_K^2 - m_{\\pi}^2 + (m_{\\Lambda} - m_p)^2}{2(m_{\\Lambda} - m_p)}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "0", "expr2": "zoo*m**2"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{(m_{\\Lambda^0} - m_p)^2 + m_{K^-}^2 - m_{\\pi^0}^2}{2(m_{\\Lambda^0} - m_p)}", "expr2": "E_K = \\frac{m_K^2 - m_{\\pi}^2 + (m_{\\Lambda} - m_p)^2}{2(m_{\\Lambda} - m_p)}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "0", "expr2": "zoo*m**2"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-3", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the Bohr radius of the hydrogen atom compares to the electron's Compton wavelength. Let me start by recalling what each of these terms means.\n\nFirst, the Bohr radius. I remember that the Bohr model describes the hydrogen atom with an electron orbiting the nucleus. The Bohr radius is the radius of the smallest orbit, right? The formula for the Bohr radius is something like a₀ = (4πε₀ħ²)/(m e²), where ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the electron mass, and e is the elementary charge. But maybe there's a simpler way to remember the value. I think the Bohr radius is approximately 0.529 angstroms, which is about 5.29 x 10^-11 meters.\n\nNow, the Compton wavelength. The Compton wavelength of a particle, in this case, the electron, is a quantum mechanical property. The formula for the Compton wavelength λ_c is given by λ_c = h/(m c), where h is Planck's constant, m is the electron mass, and c is the speed of light. Alternatively, using ħ (which is h/(2π)), it can be written as λ_c = 2πħ/(m c). The value of the Compton wavelength for an electron is approximately 2.426 x 10^-12 meters.\n\nWait, so the Bohr radius is about 5.29e-11 meters, and the Compton wavelength is about 2.43e-12 meters. Let me calculate the ratio. If I take a₀ / λ_c, that would be (5.29e-11) / (2.43e-12). Let me compute that. Dividing 5.29 by 2.43 gives roughly 2.17. Then the exponents: 10^-11 divided by 10^-12 is 10^1. So 2.17 * 10 ≈ 21.7. So the Bohr radius is about 20 times larger than the Compton wavelength. But wait, the options given are 100 times, 1000 times, or about the same. Hmm, 20 isn't close to 100 or 1000. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the values. Let me double-check. The Bohr radius is 0.529 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 0.529 angstroms is 5.29e-11 meters. That's correct. The Compton wavelength of the electron is approximately 2.426 picometers. Wait, 1 picometer is 1e-12 meters, so 2.426 picometers is 2.426e-12 meters. So the ratio is 5.29e-11 / 2.426e-12. Let me compute that again. 5.29 / 2.426 ≈ 2.18. Then 1e-11 / 1e-12 is 10. So total ratio is 2.18 * 10 ≈ 21.8. So approximately 22 times larger. But the options are 100 or 1000. That's not matching. Maybe there's a different approach here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a relationship between the Bohr radius and the Compton wavelength through the fine-structure constant. The fine-structure constant α is approximately 1/137. The Bohr radius is a₀ = (4π ε₀ ħ²)/(m e²). Let's see if we can express a₀ in terms of the Compton wavelength. Let's recall that the Compton wavelength is λ_c = h/(m c) = 2π ħ/(m c). So, let's see:\n\na₀ = (4π ε₀ ħ²)/(m e²). Let's express e² in terms of α. The fine-structure constant α is e²/(4π ε₀ ħ c) ≈ 1/137. So rearranging, e² = 4π ε₀ ħ c α. Substitute that into the expression for a₀:\n\na₀ = (4π ε₀ ħ²) / (m * 4π ε₀ ħ c α) ) = (4π ε₀ ħ²) / (4π ε₀ m ħ c α) ) = ħ/(m c α) ) = (ħ/(m c)) * (1/α). But ħ/(m c) is the reduced Compton wavelength, which is λ_c/(2π). Wait, the Compton wavelength λ_c is h/(m c) = 2π ħ/(m c). So the reduced Compton wavelength is ħ/(m c) = λ_c/(2π). Therefore, a₀ = (λ_c/(2π)) * (1/α) ) = λ_c/(2π α). Since α ≈ 1/137, then 1/α ≈ 137. So a₀ ≈ λ_c/(2π) * 137. Let's compute 137/(2π). 137 divided by 6.28 is approximately 21.8. So a₀ ≈ 21.8 * λ_c/(2π). Wait, but the reduced Compton wavelength is λ_c/(2π), so a₀ is 137 times the reduced Compton wavelength. Wait, maybe I confused the terms here.\n\nAlternatively, since a₀ = (4π ε₀ ħ²)/(m e²) and α = e²/(4π ε₀ ħ c), then substituting e² = 4π ε₀ ħ c α into the Bohr radius formula gives:\n\na₀ = (4π ε₀ ħ²) / (m * 4π ε₀ ħ c α) ) = ħ/(m c α). So a₀ = ħ/(m c α) = (ħ/(m c)) * (1/α). But ħ/(m c) is the reduced Compton wavelength, which is λ_c/(2π). Therefore, a₀ = (λ_c/(2π)) * (1/α) = λ_c/(2π α). Since α ≈ 1/137, this becomes λ_c/(2π * (1/137)) ) = (137 λ_c)/(2π). Calculating 137/(2π) ≈ 137/6.28 ≈ 21.8. So a₀ ≈ 21.8 * λ_c. Wait, that would mean the Bohr radius is about 22 times the Compton wavelength. But earlier calculation gave the same ratio. So why is the answer not matching the options?\n\nWait, the options are 100 times larger, 1000 times, or about the same. But according to this, it's about 22 times larger. But 22 is closer to 100 than to 10. Hmm. Maybe there's a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the units again.\n\nWait, the Bohr radius is 5.29e-11 m, and the Compton wavelength is 2.426e-12 m. So 5.29e-11 divided by 2.426e-12 is approximately 21.8. So the Bohr radius is about 22 times the Compton wavelength. But the options given are 100 or 1000. So none of the options match. Wait, maybe the question is comparing the Bohr radius to the reduced Compton wavelength? The reduced Compton wavelength is λ_c/(2π). Let me check that.\n\nThe reduced Compton wavelength is ħ/(m c) ≈ 3.86e-13 m. Then the Bohr radius would be 5.29e-11 / 3.86e-13 ≈ 137 times. Wait, 5.29e-11 divided by 3.86e-13 is approximately 137. So if the question is comparing the Bohr radius to the reduced Compton wavelength, then it's about 137 times larger. But the options are 100 or 1000. 137 is closer to 100 than to 1000. So maybe the answer is (a) 100 times larger. But why would the question refer to the reduced Compton wavelength instead of the standard Compton wavelength?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me check the values again. The standard Compton wavelength for the electron is λ_c = h/(m c) = 6.626e-34 J·s / (9.109e-31 kg * 3e8 m/s). Let me compute that:\n\nDenominator: 9.109e-31 * 3e8 = 2.7327e-22 kg·m/s\n\nSo λ_c = 6.626e-34 / 2.7327e-22 ≈ 2.424e-12 meters. That's correct. So the Bohr radius is 5.29e-11 m. So 5.29e-11 / 2.424e-12 ≈ 21.8. So approximately 22 times. But the options don't have 20. So maybe the answer is (a) 100 times larger. But why?\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased incorrectly, or perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me think again. The Bohr radius is a₀ = (4π ε₀ ħ²)/(m e²). The Compton wavelength is λ_c = h/(m c). Let's express a₀ in terms of λ_c.\n\nWe can write a₀ = (4π ε₀ ħ²)/(m e²). Let's use the definition of the fine-structure constant α = e²/(4π ε₀ ħ c) ≈ 1/137. Solving for e² gives e² = 4π ε₀ ħ c α. Substitute this into the expression for a₀:\n\na₀ = (4π ε₀ ħ²) / (m * 4π ε₀ ħ c α) ) = ħ/(m c α). Then, since λ_c = h/(m c) = 2π ħ/(m c), so ħ/(m c) = λ_c/(2π). Therefore, a₀ = (λ_c/(2π)) * (1/α) = λ_c/(2π α). Plugging in α ≈ 1/137:\n\na₀ ≈ λ_c/(2π * 1/137) ) = (137 λ_c)/(2π) ≈ (137 / 6.283) λ_c ≈ 21.8 λ_c. So again, about 22 times. So the Bohr radius is approximately 22 times the Compton wavelength. But the options given are 100, 1000, or same. So none of these. But maybe the question is referring to the classical electron radius? Wait, the classical electron radius is about 2.8e-15 m, which is much smaller. Not relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is comparing the Bohr radius to the Compton wavelength divided by alpha? Wait, but that would be even larger. Hmm. Wait, maybe the question is in error, or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check standard references.\n\nLooking up, the Bohr radius is approximately 0.5 angstroms, and the Compton wavelength is about 0.0024 nanometers (which is 2.4 picometers). So 0.5 angstroms is 0.05 nanometers. 0.05 nm divided by 0.0024 nm is approximately 20.8. So again, about 21 times. So the Bohr radius is roughly 20 times the Compton wavelength. But the options given are 100, 1000, or same. So none of the options match. But the closest is (a) 100 times. But 20 is not close to 100. Wait, maybe the question is comparing the Bohr radius to the electron's de Broglie wavelength instead? No, the question specifically mentions Compton wavelength.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a confusion between the Compton wavelength and the reduced Compton wavelength. The reduced Compton wavelength is λ_c/(2π) ≈ 3.86e-13 m. Then the Bohr radius is 5.29e-11 / 3.86e-13 ≈ 137 times. So 137 times the reduced Compton wavelength. But the question says Compton wavelength, not reduced. So if the answer options are 100 times, then 137 is closer to 100 than to 1000. So maybe the intended answer is (a) 100 times larger. But why would the question refer to the reduced Compton wavelength? Unless there's a mistake in the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original problem uses approximate values. For example, if someone approximates the Bohr radius as 0.5e-10 m and the Compton wavelength as 2e-12 m, then 0.5e-10 / 2e-12 = 25. So still around 25 times. Still not 100. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the ratio of the Bohr radius to the Compton wavelength of the proton? No, the question says electron Compton wavelength.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. 5.29e-11 divided by 2.426e-12. Let's compute this step by step. 5.29e-11 / 2.426e-12 = (5.29 / 2.426) * (1e-11 / 1e-12) = 2.18 * 10 = 21.8. So yes, approximately 22 times. So the Bohr radius is about 22 times the electron's Compton wavelength. But the options given don't include 20. So perhaps the answer is (a) 100 times larger, but that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the question is incorrect. But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is (a) 100 times larger, considering that 137 is closer to 100 than to 1000. Wait, but 137 is closer to 100 than to 1000. But the actual ratio is 22. So maybe the answer is (a) 100 times larger, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the ratio of the Bohr radius to the classical electron radius, which is about 100 times. The classical electron radius is about 2.8e-15 m. Then 5.29e-11 / 2.8e-15 ≈ 1.89e4, which is about 20,000 times. Not relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is mixing up the Compton wavelength with another quantity. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (c) about the same, but 22 times is not the same. Alternatively, maybe the options are wrong. But given the choices, the closest would be (a) 100 times larger. But why?\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the ratio in terms of orders of magnitude. The Bohr radius is ~5e-11 m, Compton wavelength ~2e-12 m. The difference in exponents is 10^-11 vs 10^-12, so one order of magnitude. 10 times. But 5e-11 / 2e-12 is 25, which is two orders of magnitude? Wait, no. 10^-11 is 10 times larger than 10^-12. So 5e-11 is 5*10 times 1e-12, so 50 times 1e-12. But the Compton wavelength is 2.4e-12, so 50/2.4 ≈ 20.8. So approximately 20 times. So two orders of magnitude would be 100 times. But 20 is between 10^1 and 10^2. So maybe the question is considering the ratio of the Bohr radius to the Compton wavelength as approximately 100 times. But that's not accurate. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (a) 100 times larger, but the actual value is around 20. But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is (a) 100 times. Maybe the question expects the use of the inverse of the fine-structure constant, which is approximately 137, so around 100. So the Bohr radius is a₀ ≈ (1/α) * (reduced Compton wavelength). So if someone approximates 1/α as 100, then the answer would be 100 times. But 1/α is 137, which is closer to 100 than to 1000. So maybe the intended answer is (a) 100 times larger. That's possible. So even though the exact ratio is about 22, if you consider the inverse fine-structure constant (which is 137), and approximate it as 100, then the answer would be (a). Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the ratio of the Bohr radius to the reduced Compton wavelength, which is 137 times. So if the answer options are 100, 1000, or same, then 137 is closer to 100. So the answer would be (a) 100 times larger.\n\nTherefore, considering that the Bohr radius is approximately 137 times the reduced Compton wavelength, and if the question confuses Compton wavelength with reduced Compton wavelength, then the answer would be (a). Alternatively, if the question is using approximate values, the answer might be (a). Given the options provided, the closest answer is (a) 100 times larger.\n</think>\n\nThe Bohr radius (\\(a_0\\)) and the electron Compton wavelength (\\(\\lambda_c\\)) are fundamental quantities in quantum mechanics.

{"id": "atomic/4-17", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the threshold energy for a gamma ray to create an electron-positron pair when interacting with an electron that's at rest. Hmm, let me think. I remember that pair production usually involves a photon interacting with a nucleus or something with enough mass to conserve momentum. But here, the problem says it's interacting with an electron at rest. That's different because the electron has much less mass than a nucleus. \n\nWait, pair production requires the photon to have enough energy to create the electron and positron, which each have rest mass energy of 0.511 MeV. So the total rest mass energy needed is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. But if the photon is interacting with an electron, maybe there's a different threshold because the electron can recoil. \n\nIn the case of pair production in the Coulomb field of a nucleus, the nucleus takes away some momentum, but since it's heavy, the threshold energy is just the 1.022 MeV. But here, the target is an electron, which is light, so the threshold might be higher. Because both the electron and the created particles will have to share the momentum, so the photon needs more energy to satisfy conservation laws. \n\nLet me recall the conservation of energy and momentum. The gamma ray (photon) has energy E_γ and momentum E_γ / c (since for photons, E = pc). The electron is initially at rest, so its energy is m_e c² and momentum is zero. After the interaction, we have the original electron, plus the electron-positron pair. Wait, no—wait, the original electron is part of the reaction. So the products would be the original electron plus the new electron and positron? Wait, no, maybe the original electron is involved in the reaction. Let me clarify the reaction. \n\nThe reaction should be γ + e⁻ → e⁻ + e⁺ + e⁻. Wait, that can't be right. Because the original electron is a fermion, and you can't have three electrons. Wait, maybe the reaction is γ + e⁻ → e⁻ + e⁺ + e⁻? But that would have two electrons and a positron. But that seems like a problem because you can't just create an electron-positron pair and have the original electron. Wait, maybe the correct reaction is γ + e⁻ → e⁻ + e⁺ + e⁻? But that would result in two electrons and a positron. But charge conservation: initial charge is -1 (electron). After reaction, we have -1 (original e⁻) + -1 (new e⁻) + +1 (e⁺) = -1. So charge is conserved. But is this reaction possible? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is γ + e⁻ → e⁺ + e⁻ + e⁻? Wait, but that would be charge -1 on both sides. Wait, original charge is -1. After reaction, it's +1 (e⁺) + -1 (e⁻) + -1 (e⁻) = -1. So charge is conserved. But I'm not sure if this is the correct way to think about it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the process is that the photon and electron interact to produce an electron-positron pair, with the original electron. So the products are two electrons and a positron. But that seems like a lot. Wait, but pair production usually creates a pair, so maybe in this case, since there's an initial electron, the photon creates a pair, so the products are the original electron plus the pair. So three particles: e⁻, e⁺, e⁻. \n\nBut regardless, the key is to calculate the threshold energy where this reaction becomes possible. The threshold occurs when the kinetic energy is just enough so that all the resulting particles are produced at rest, but since momentum must be conserved, they can't all be at rest. So in the center-of-momentum frame, maybe? Wait, but the initial electron is at rest, so the lab frame is the rest frame of the electron. \n\nIn the lab frame, the electron is at rest, and the photon comes in with some energy. At threshold, the final particles will have the minimum kinetic energy, which means they are all moving together with the same velocity. So in the lab frame, after the collision, the three particles (two electrons and a positron) move together as a single system. \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me think. At threshold, the products are created with zero relative velocity. So they all move together with the same velocity. Therefore, in the lab frame, the total momentum after the collision is (3m_e) * v, assuming the two electrons and one positron have the same mass (but positron has same mass as electron). Wait, but the positron is same mass as electron. So total mass after collision is 2m_e (since original electron plus pair: e⁻ + e⁺ + e⁻ = two electrons and a positron. Wait, but the positron is a separate particle. Wait, but the total rest mass would be 3m_e? Wait, no. The rest mass of each electron and positron is m_e. So three particles: two electrons and one positron, each of mass m_e. So total rest mass energy is 3m_e c². But that can't be right because the original electron was at rest, and the photon's energy is contributing. Wait, but maybe I need to consider the invariant quantity here. \n\nAlternatively, use conservation of energy and momentum. Let's denote the initial photon energy as E_γ, and the initial electron energy is m_e c². After the reaction, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies of the three particles (assuming threshold where they are at rest relative to each other) plus their kinetic energy. But at threshold, their kinetic energy is minimized, which would mean they are all at rest in the center-of-momentum frame. But since the initial electron is at rest, the center-of-momentum frame is different. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the problem in the center-of-momentum frame. But the initial electron is at rest, so the lab frame is not the CM frame unless the photon's momentum is balanced. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, use conservation of energy and momentum in the lab frame. \n\nInitial momentum: photon's momentum is E_γ / c (since p_photon = E_γ / c). The electron is at rest, so its momentum is zero. Total initial momentum is E_γ / c. \n\nAfter the collision, the three particles (two electrons and one positron) must have total momentum equal to E_γ / c. At threshold, they are all moving in the same direction as the photon with the same velocity, so their total momentum is (3m_e) * v * γ, where γ is the Lorentz factor. But this might complicate things. \n\nAlternatively, use the invariant quantity s = (E_total / c)^2 - (p_total)^2. s is invariant. \n\nIn the initial state, the total energy is E_γ + m_e c². The total momentum is E_γ / c. So s_initial = (E_γ + m_e c²)^2 - (E_γ / c)^2 c^2 = (E_γ + m_e c²)^2 - E_γ². \n\nIn the final state, at threshold, the three particles (two electrons and one positron) have minimum kinetic energy, so they are all at rest in the center-of-mass frame. Therefore, the invariant s_final must be equal to (3m_e c²)^2. \n\nWait, but the invariant s is the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame divided by c². So s_initial = s_final. Therefore:\n\n(E_γ + m_e c²)^2 - (E_γ)^2 = (3m_e c²)^2\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nLeft side: (E_γ + m_e c²)^2 - E_γ² = [E_γ² + 2 E_γ m_e c² + (m_e c²)^2] - E_γ² = 2 E_γ m_e c² + (m_e c²)^2\n\nSet equal to (3m_e c²)^2:\n\n2 E_γ m_e c² + (m_e c²)^2 = 9 (m_e c²)^2\n\nSubtract (m_e c²)^2 from both sides:\n\n2 E_γ m_e c² = 8 (m_e c²)^2\n\nDivide both sides by 2 m_e c²:\n\nE_γ = 4 m_e c²\n\nWait, so the threshold energy is 4 times the rest mass energy of the electron? That is 4 * 0.511 MeV ≈ 2.044 MeV. \n\nBut wait, that seems high. Because in pair production with a nucleus, the threshold is 1.022 MeV. But here, since the target is an electron, which is lighter, the threshold is higher. So 4 times the electron rest mass. \n\nBut let me check the calculation again. \n\ns_initial = (E_γ + m_e c²)^2 - (E_γ / c)^2 c^2 = (E_γ + m_e c²)^2 - E_γ²\n\nExpanding (E_γ + m_e c²)^2:\n\nE_γ² + 2 E_γ m_e c² + (m_e c²)^2 - E_γ² = 2 E_γ m_e c² + (m_e c²)^2\n\nSet equal to s_final = (3 m_e c²)^2 = 9 (m_e c²)^2\n\nSo:\n\n2 E_γ m_e c² + (m_e c²)^2 = 9 (m_e c²)^2\n\nSubtract (m_e c²)^2:\n\n2 E_γ m_e c² = 8 (m_e c²)^2\n\nDivide by 2 m_e c²:\n\nE_γ = 4 m_e c²\n\nYes, that's correct. So the threshold energy is 4 m_e c², which is 4 * 0.511 MeV ≈ 2.044 MeV. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: in pair production with a nucleus, the nucleus is so heavy that it can take away momentum without requiring much energy. But here, the target is an electron, so the photon must provide enough energy not only for the rest mass of the pair but also for the recoiling particles to conserve momentum. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let's consider conservation of energy and momentum in the lab frame. \n\nInitial energy: E_γ + m_e c²\n\nInitial momentum: E_γ / c (since the electron is at rest)\n\nFinal energy: sum of the energies of the three particles. At threshold, they should all move together (to minimize kinetic energy), so their velocities are the same. Let's denote their common velocity as v. Then each has energy γ m_e c², where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since there are three particles, total energy is 3 γ m_e c².\n\nFinal momentum: each particle has momentum γ m_e v. Since they are moving in the same direction, total momentum is 3 γ m_e v.\n\nSo conservation of energy:\n\nE_γ + m_e c² = 3 γ m_e c²\n\nConservation of momentum:\n\nE_γ / c = 3 γ m_e v\n\nFrom the energy equation:\n\nE_γ = 3 γ m_e c² - m_e c² = m_e c² (3 γ - 1)\n\nFrom the momentum equation:\n\nE_γ = 3 γ m_e v c\n\nSet the two expressions for E_γ equal:\n\nm_e c² (3 γ - 1) = 3 γ m_e v c\n\nDivide both sides by m_e c:\n\nc (3 γ - 1) = 3 γ v\n\nDivide both sides by c:\n\n3 γ - 1 = 3 γ (v / c)\n\nLet β = v / c, so:\n\n3 γ - 1 = 3 γ β\n\nBut γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), so substitute:\n\n3 / sqrt(1 - β²) - 1 = 3 β / sqrt(1 - β²)\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(1 - β²):\n\n3 - sqrt(1 - β²) = 3 β\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n3 - 3 β = sqrt(1 - β²)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(3 - 3 β)^2 = 1 - β²\n\nExpand left side:\n\n9 - 18 β + 9 β² = 1 - β²\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n9 - 18 β + 9 β² - 1 + β² = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n8 - 18 β + 10 β² = 0\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n4 - 9 β + 5 β² = 0\n\nQuadratic equation: 5 β² -9 β +4 =0\n\nSolutions:\n\nβ = [9 ± sqrt(81 - 80)] / 10 = [9 ±1]/10\n\nSo β = (9+1)/10=10/10=1 or β=(9-1)/10=8/10=0.8\n\nβ=1 is invalid (v=c), so β=0.8\n\nThen γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64) = 1 / sqrt(0.36) = 1/0.6 = 5/3 ≈1.6667\n\nNow plug back into E_γ = m_e c² (3 γ -1 )\n\nE_γ = m_e c² (3*(5/3) -1 ) = m_e c² (5 -1 ) = 4 m_e c²\n\nSame result as before. So the threshold energy is indeed 4 times the electron rest mass energy, which is 4 * 0.511 MeV = 2.044 MeV. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 4 m_e c², which is approximately 2.044 MeV. But since the question asks for the threshold energy, the exact value is 4m_e c². \n\nBut wait, let me confirm once more. The process is gamma + electron -> electron + positron + electron. So the rest mass energy needed is 2m_e c² (for the pair), but because the initial electron is also present, but in the final state, there are two electrons and a positron. Wait, but the initial electron is part of the reaction. So the rest mass of the final system is 3m_e c²? No, because the rest mass is the sum of the individual rest masses. But in reality, when particles are moving, their total energy is more than the sum of rest masses. However, at threshold, they are produced with the minimum kinetic energy such that momentum is conserved. \n\nBut according to the calculation using the invariant s, we arrived at E_γ =4 m_e c². So that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think: in pair production with a nucleus, the threshold is 2m_e c² (1.022 MeV) because the nucleus can take away momentum. But when the target is an electron, which is light, the photon needs to provide more energy to ensure momentum conservation. The calculation shows that the threshold is 4m_e c². \n\nYes, this makes sense. So the threshold energy is 4 times the electron rest mass energy.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the threshold energy for a gamma ray to create an electron-positron pair in an interaction with an electron at rest, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The reaction is \\(\\gamma + e^- \\rightarrow e^- + e^+ + e^-\\). At threshold, the final particles move together with the same velocity to minimize kinetic energy.\n\n**Key steps:**\n1. **Invariant quantity \\(s\\):**  \n   The invariant \\(s\\) is the square of the total energy in the center-of-momentum frame divided by \\(c^2\\). For the initial state (photon + electron at rest):  \n   \\[\n   s_{\\text{initial}} = \\left(E_\\gamma + m_e c^2\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{E_\\gamma}{c}\\right)^2 c^2 = 2E_\\gamma m_e c^2 + (m_e c^2)^2\n   \\]  \n   For the final state (three particles at rest in the center-of-mass frame):  \n   \\[\n   s_{\\text{final}} = (3m_e c^2)^2 = 9(m_e c^2)^2\n   \\]  \n   Equating \\(s_{\\text{initial}} = s_{\\text{final}}\\):  \n   \\[\n   2E_\\gamma m_e c^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 = 9(m_e c^2)^2\n   \\]  \n   Solving for \\(E_\\gamma\\):  \n   \\[\n   2E_\\gamma m_e c^2 = 8(m_e c^2)^2 \\implies E_\\gamma = 4m_e c^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Verification via energy and momentum conservation:**  \n   At threshold, the final particles share the same velocity. Using relativistic energy and momentum relations confirms the result:  \n   \\[\n   E_\\gamma = 4m_e c^2\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe threshold energy for the gamma ray is \\(\\boxed{4m_e c^2}\\), where \\(m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511\\ \\text{MeV}\\).

{"id": "atomic/3-9", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants me to briefly discuss four out of the seven topics listed. Let me go through each one and see which ones I can explain clearly.\n\nStarting with (1) J/ψ particle. I remember that the J/ψ is a subatomic particle, specifically a meson. It was discovered in 1974, which led to the confirmation of the existence of charm quarks. It's made of a charm quark and a charm antiquark. This discovery was important for the Standard Model because it provided evidence for the quark model and the concept of gluons. I should mention its composition and significance.\n\nNext, (2) Neutral K meson system. The neutral kaons, K⁰ and its antiparticle, exhibit particle-antiparticle mixing. They can oscillate between different states. The two main states are K₁ and K₂, which are combinations of the strangeness eigenstates. The regeneration part refers to when a beam of K_L (long-lived) mesons passes through matter, some can convert back to K_S (short-lived) due to interactions, allowing observation of regeneration of the short-lived component. I need to explain the mixing and regeneration.\n\n(3) Two types of neutrino. Originally, neutrinos were thought to come in types associated with their charged leptons: electron, muon, and tau. But the question mentions two types. Wait, maybe it's referring to the distinction between neutrinos and antineutrinos? Or perhaps the different flavors? Wait, the two types might be electron neutrino and muon neutrino, which were discovered first. Before the tau neutrino was found, there were two known. Or maybe it's about the helicity states (left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos). But the question says \"types,\" so probably flavors. But the user might be referring to the historical context where only electron and muon neutrinos were known. Need to clarify that.\n\n(4) Neutron electric dipole moment (EDM). The EDM measures the separation of positive and negative charges within the neutron. A non-zero EDM would imply time-reversal symmetry violation, which relates to CP violation via the CPT theorem. Experiments have set very low upper limits, which supports the Standard Model predictions, but some theories beyond the SM predict larger values. So, it's a test of CP violation and new physics.\n\n(5) Associated production. This is a process where certain particles are produced together to conserve quantum numbers. For example, strange particles are often produced in pairs because the strong interaction conserves strangeness, but individual production would violate it. So, when a lambda particle is produced, a K meson might be produced alongside to conserve strangeness. This was observed before the quark model explained it via the s quark content.\n\n(6) Fermi theory of beta decay. Fermi proposed a theory where beta decay involves the transformation of a neutron into a proton, emitting an electron and a neutrino. It's a four-fermion interaction with a coupling constant (Fermi's constant). The interaction is weak and involves vector currents. However, this theory was later replaced by the electroweak theory with W bosons mediating the interaction. But Fermi's theory was a good approximation at low energies.\n\n(7) Abnormal magnetic moment of the muon. The magnetic moment of the muon deviates slightly from the Dirac value (g=2) due to quantum loop corrections. The anomalous magnetic moment a = (g-2)/2 is measured very precisely. Recent experiments (like Muon g-2 at Fermilab) show a discrepancy between experimental values and Standard Model predictions, suggesting possible new physics.\n\nNow, pick four. Let's choose 1, 2, 3, and 7. Wait, but the user said \"four of the following,\" so any four. Let me check each again.\n\n1. J/ψ: straightforward. 2. Neutral K system: mixing and regeneration. 3. Two neutrino types: maybe electron and muon, or neutrinos and antineutrinos. 4. Neutron EDM: CP violation. 5. Associated production: strangeness conservation. 6. Fermi theory: beta decay. 7. Muon g-2: anomaly.\n\nI think 1, 2, 3, and 7 are manageable. Let's outline each:\n\n1. J/ψ: Charmonium state, discovery, significance in quark model.\n\n2. Neutral K mesons: K⁰ and K̄⁰ mix into K₁ and K₂ (or K_S and K_L). Regeneration when K_L interacts with matter, producing K_S.\n\n3. Two neutrino types: Originally, electron and muon neutrinos were known as distinct types, differing in lepton family. Later, tau neutrino added. The two types have different interactions.\n\n7. Muon g-2: Anomalous magnetic moment, recent experiments hinting at new physics.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (3) refers to neutrinos and antineutrinos? But the question says \"types,\" which usually refers to flavors. So, electron and muon neutrinos. The two types were confirmed in experiments showing that neutrinos from pion decay (producing muon neutrinos) couldn't produce electrons, hence distinct from electron neutrinos.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two types are referring to Dirac vs. Majorana? But that's not in the options. The question says \"the two types of neutrino,\" so probably the flavors known at the time (electron and muon), before tau was discovered. But the user might want the distinction between neutrino and antineutrino? Hmm. Need to clarify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two types are the neutrino states involved in oscillations, like mass eigenstates vs flavor eigenstates. But that's more about neutrino mixing. The question might be simpler: the existence of electron and muon neutrinos as distinct particles, as opposed to being the same. The experiment by Lederman, Schwartz, and Steinberger in 1962 showed that muon neutrinos produced in pion decay don't produce electrons when interacting, proving they're distinct from electron neutrinos. So, two types: electron and muon neutrinos.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So for (3), the two types are electron and muon neutrinos, which are different lepton families. So, each associated with their respective leptons.\n\nNow, structuring each answer concisely:\n\n1. J/ψ Particle: Composed of charm quark and antiquark. Discovered independently by Ting (J particle) and Richter (ψ), hence the name. Its discovery confirmed the charm quark's existence, supporting the quark model and QCD. It's a bound state (charmonium) with a mass around 3.1 GeV/c². Long lifetime due to OZI rule suppression of decay modes.\n\n2. Neutral K Meson System: K⁰ (strange quark + down antiquark) and K̄⁰ (anti-strange + down) mix via weak interactions, forming CP eigenstates K₁ (CP +1) and K₂ (CP -1), which correspond to short-lived (K_S) and long-lived (K_L) states. Regeneration occurs when K_L interacts with matter, causing some to transform back into K_S, observable as a renewed short-lived decay component.\n\n3. Two Types of Neutrino: Electron neutrino (ν_e) and muon neutrino (ν_μ). Demonstrated in 1962 via accelerator experiments showing ν_μ from pion decay didn't produce electrons, proving distinct neutrino types. This led to the concept of lepton families and later discovery of tau neutrino (ν_τ).\n\n7. Muon Anomalous Magnetic Moment: The muon's magnetic moment deviates from Dirac's prediction (a_μ = (g-2)/2). Quantum loops in the Standard Model (SM) predict a value, but experiments (e.g., Muon g-2 at Fermilab) show a ~3-4σ discrepancy, suggesting possible beyond-SM physics like supersymmetry or extra dimensions.\n\nAlternatively, if I need to pick another instead of 7, maybe (6) Fermi's theory. Let me check:\n\n6. Fermi Theory: Proposed in 1933, it models beta decay (n → p + e⁻ + ν̄_e) as a four-fermion contact interaction. The interaction strength is given by Fermi's constant G_F. It assumed vector current coupling, later modified to include parity violation (V-A theory). Replaced by electroweak theory with W boson exchange, but remains effective at low energies.\n\nBut the user asked for four. Let me stick with 1,2,3,7. Now, write concise explanations for each.\n</think>\n\n(1) **$J/\\psi$ Particle**:  \nThe $J/\\psi$ is a charmonium meson composed of a charm quark and its antiquark ($c\\bar{c}$). Discovered independently in 1974 by Ting (naming it J) and Richter (ψ), its existence confirmed the charm quark predicted by the quark model. The $J/\\psi$ has a mass of ~3.1 GeV/c² and a relatively long lifetime due to suppressed decays via the OZI rule. This discovery validated Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and the Standard Model.  \n\n(2) **Neutral $K$ Meson System**:  \nNeutral kaons ($K^0$, $s\\bar{d}$) and their antiparticles ($\\bar{K}^0$, $\\bar{s}d$) mix via weak interactions, forming CP eigenstates: $K_S$ (short-lived, CP=+1) and $K_L$ (long-lived, CP=−1). Regeneration occurs when $K_L$ traverses matter, interacting to produce a $K_S$ component. This regenerated $K_S$ decays rapidly (e.g., to $\\pi^+\\pi^-$), allowing observation of renewed short-lived decays.  \n\n(3) **Two Types of Neutrino**:  \nElectron ($\\nu_e$) and muon ($\\nu_\\mu$) neutrinos are distinct lepton flavors. The 1962 Brookhaven experiment showed $\\nu_\\mu$ from $\\pi^+\\to\\mu^+\\nu_\\mu$ interactions produced muons, not electrons, proving $\\nu_\\mu \\neq \\nu_e$. This established neutrinos as flavor-specific, forming separate lepton families. The tau neutrino ($\\nu_\\tau$) was later discovered.  \n\n(7) **Abnormal Magnetic Moment of the Muon**:  \nThe muon’s anomalous magnetic moment $a_\\mu = (g-2)/2$ measures deviations from the Dirac value ($g=2$). Quantum loops in the Standard Model (SM) predict $a_\\mu^{\\text{SM}}$, but experiments (e.g., Fermilab’s Muon g-2) report a ~3-4σ discrepancy. This hints at new physics, such as supersymmetry or dark matter interactions.  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Discussed topics: } J/\\psi, \\text{Neutral } K \\text{ system, Neutrino types, Muon } g-2}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Discussed topics: } J/\\psi, \\text{Neutral } K \\text{ system, Neutrino types, Muon } g-2"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Discussed topics: } J/\\psi, \\text{Neutral } K \\text{ system, Neutrino types, Muon } g-2", "expr2": "m(J/\\psi) = (3096.9 \\pm 0.1) \\ \\text{MeV}/c^{2}, \\ \\Gamma = (63 \\pm 9) \\ \\text{keV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Discussed topics: } J/\\psi, \\text{Neutral } K \\text{ system, Neutrino types, Muon } g-2", "expr2": "\\nu_{e} \\text{ and } \\nu_{\\mu} \\text{ are different}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Discussed topics: } J/\\psi, \\text{Neutral } K \\text{ system, Neutrino types, Muon } g-2", "expr2": "D = (0.4 \\pm 1.1) \\times 10^{-24} \\ \\text{cm}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Discussed topics: } J/\\psi, \\text{Neutral } K \\text{ system, Neutrino types, Muon } g-2", "expr2": "\\left[ \\frac{dI(p_e)}{p_e^2 F d p_e} \\right]^{1/2} = C |M_{ij}|^2 (E_0 - E_e)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Discussed topics: } J/\\psi, \\text{Neutral } K \\text{ system, Neutrino types, Muon } g-2", "expr2": "\\alpha_{\\mu}^{\\text{th}} = (116592.1 \\pm 1.0) \\times 10^{-8}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/3-38", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The problem is about estimating the mean life of the tau particle (τ⁺) given that the muon's (μ⁺) mean life is 2.2e-6 seconds and the branching ratio for the tau decay into e+ ν ν̄ is 16%. Both decays are supposed to proceed via the same interaction, which I think is the weak interaction. \n\nSo, since the interactions are the same, the decay rates should be related by the same coupling constants and phase space factors. But since the muon and tau have different masses, the phase space available for the decay will be different. The branching ratio for the tau decay into electrons is 16%, which means that this particular decay channel is only a fraction of the total decay rate of the tau. \n\nFirst, I remember that the decay rate Γ for a leptonic decay is proportional to the fifth power of the mass of the decaying particle. Wait, that's from Fermi's Golden Rule, where the phase space integral for a three-body decay (like muon decay) would depend on the mass of the particle. But muon decay is a three-body decay: μ⁺ → e⁺ ν ν̄. Similarly, tau decay to e+ ν ν̄ is also three-body. \n\nBut wait, the muon decay is the dominant decay mode for the muon, whereas for the tau, the decay to e+ ν ν̄ is just one of several possible decay channels. The branching ratio (BR) is the ratio of the partial decay rate for that channel to the total decay rate. So, BR(τ→eνν̄) = Γ(τ→eνν̄)/Γ_total. \n\nSince the problem states that both decays proceed via the same interaction, the partial width Γ(τ→eνν̄) should be related to Γ(μ→eνν̄) by some factor, probably involving the masses. Then, once we find Γ(τ→eνν̄), and knowing the branching ratio is 16%, we can find Γ_total for the tau, and hence its mean life τ_tau = 1/Γ_total.\n\nSo, the key steps are:\n\n1. Find the ratio Γ(τ→eνν̄)/Γ(μ→eνν̄). Since the interactions are the same, this ratio would be determined by the phase space differences and the coupling constants. But if the coupling is the same (same interaction), then the ratio would be (m_tau/m_mu)^5, because for three-body decays, the decay rate is proportional to the fifth power of the mass. Wait, but I need to confirm this.\n\nWait, muon decay is a three-body decay. The general formula for the decay rate of a three-body decay for a charged lepton decaying into a lighter charged lepton and two neutrinos (like μ → e ν ν̄) is given by:\n\nΓ = (G_F² m^5)/(192 π³) * phase space factors,\n\nwhere G_F is Fermi's constant. But actually, since the neutrinos are massless, the phase space integral can be calculated, and the result is that Γ ∝ G_F² m^5. So, if the coupling constants (G_F) are the same for both muon and tau decays, then the partial decay widths for the similar decay channels (e.g., τ → e ν ν̄ and μ → e ν ν̄) should scale with the fifth power of the mass of the decaying particle.\n\nBut wait, the muon decay is μ → e ν ν̄, and the tau decay is τ → e ν ν̄. So, the only difference is the mass of the decaying particle. Therefore, Γ_τ→eνν̄ / Γ_μ→eνν̄ = (m_tau/m_mu)^5.\n\nBut wait, the electron mass is negligible compared to the muon and tau masses. So, when we compute the phase space, maybe the electron mass can be neglected. But even if we include it, since m_e << m_mu, m_tau, the approximation m_e ≈ 0 might be valid. So, the phase space would be similar, leading to the Γ ∝ m^5 scaling.\n\nTherefore, Γ_τ→eνν̄ = Γ_μ→eνν̄ * (m_tau/m_mu)^5.\n\nBut Γ_μ→eνν̄ is the total decay rate of the muon, since the muon decays almost 100% into e ν ν̄. The muon's mean life is τ_mu = 2.2e-6 s, so Γ_mu_total = 1/τ_mu ≈ 4.55e5 s^-1.\n\nBut since the muon's branching ratio for μ → e ν ν̄ is nearly 100%, Γ_mu_total ≈ Γ_mu→eνν̄.\n\nTherefore, Γ_tau→eνν̄ = (m_tau/m_mu)^5 * Γ_mu_total.\n\nBut the tau's total decay rate Γ_tau_total is related to its mean life by τ_tau = 1/Γ_tau_total.\n\nHowever, the branching ratio BR(tau→eνν̄) = Γ_tau→eνν̄ / Γ_tau_total = 16% = 0.16.\n\nTherefore, Γ_tau_total = Γ_tau→eνν̄ / 0.16.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nΓ_tau_total = (m_tau/m_mu)^5 * Γ_mu_total / 0.16\n\nBut Γ_mu_total = 1/τ_mu, so:\n\nΓ_tau_total = (m_tau/m_mu)^5 / (0.16 τ_mu)\n\nTherefore, τ_tau = 1/Γ_tau_total = 0.16 τ_mu / (m_tau/m_mu)^5\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nm_mu = 106 MeV/c²\n\nm_tau = 1784 MeV/c²\n\nSo, m_tau/m_mu = 1784 / 106 ≈ 16.83\n\nThen, (m_tau/m_mu)^5 ≈ (16.83)^5. Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 16.83^2 ≈ 283.3\n\n16.83^3 ≈ 16.83 * 283.3 ≈ 4767\n\n16.83^4 ≈ 4767 * 16.83 ≈ 80,200\n\n16.83^5 ≈ 80,200 * 16.83 ≈ 1,350,000 (approx). Wait, maybe I should compute more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, use logarithms or exponents.\n\nBut perhaps approximate:\n\n16.83^5 = (10 + 6.83)^5, but maybe better to compute step by step.\n\n16.83^2 = 16.83 * 16.83\n\n16 * 16 = 256, 16 * 0.83 = 13.28, 0.83 * 16 = 13.28, 0.83 * 0.83 ≈ 0.6889\n\nSo total: 256 + 13.28 +13.28 +0.6889 ≈ 256 + 26.56 +0.6889 ≈ 283.25. So that's correct.\n\n16.83^3 = 283.25 * 16.83 ≈ 283 *16 + 283*0.83 ≈ 4528 + 235 ≈ 4763. So approx 4763.\n\n16.83^4 = 4763 *16.83 ≈ 4763*10=47,630; 4763*6=28,578; 4763*0.83≈3953. So total ≈47,630 +28,578=76,208 +3953≈80,161. So 80,161.\n\n16.83^5 = 80,161 *16.83 ≈ 80,000*16.83 + 161*16.83 ≈ 1,346,400 + 2,709 ≈ 1,349,109. So approximately 1.349e6.\n\nSo (m_tau/m_mu)^5 ≈ 1.349e6.\n\nThen, τ_tau = 0.16 * τ_mu / (1.349e6)\n\nτ_mu is 2.2e-6 s.\n\nSo τ_tau ≈ 0.16 * 2.2e-6 / 1.349e6 ≈ (0.16 * 2.2 / 1.349) * 1e-12\n\nCompute numerator: 0.16 *2.2 = 0.352\n\n0.352 / 1.349 ≈ 0.261\n\nSo τ_tau ≈ 0.261e-12 s ≈ 2.61e-13 s.\n\nWait, that seems extremely short. But let's check the calculation again.\n\nWait, m_tau/m_mu is 1784/106 ≈16.8301887.\n\nSo (16.8301887)^5. Let me compute this more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, use natural logarithm:\n\nln(16.8301887) ≈ ln(16) + ln(1.05189) ≈ 2.7726 + 0.0506 ≈ 2.8232.\n\nWait, 16.83 is approximately e^2.8232 ≈ 16.83.\n\nThen, ln(16.83^5) =5*2.8232 ≈14.116, so 16.83^5 ≈ e^14.116 ≈ e^14 * e^0.116 ≈ 1.202e6 * 1.123 ≈ 1.349e6, which matches the previous estimate.\n\nSo (m_tau/m_mu)^5 ≈1.349e6.\n\nSo τ_tau = 0.16 * τ_mu / (1.349e6) = 0.16 * 2.2e-6 / 1.349e6.\n\nCompute numerator: 0.16 *2.2e-6 = 0.352e-6.\n\nDenominator:1.349e6.\n\nSo τ_tau = (0.352e-6) / (1.349e6) = 0.352 /1.349 * 1e-12 ≈0.261 *1e-12 =2.61e-13 seconds.\n\nBut wait, the known tau mean life is about 2.9e-13 seconds, so this is in the ballpark. So maybe this is correct.\n\nBut let me check again.\n\nWait, the formula:\n\nτ_tau = (BR) * τ_mu * (m_mu/m_tau)^5.\n\nWait, because Γ_tau_total = Γ_tau→eνν̄ / BR = ( (m_tau/m_mu)^5 * Γ_mu ) / BR.\n\nBut Γ_mu =1/τ_mu.\n\nThus, Γ_tau_total = (m_tau^5 / m_mu^5) * (1/τ_mu) / BR.\n\nTherefore, τ_tau = 1/Γ_tau_total = BR * τ_mu * (m_mu/m_tau)^5.\n\nYes, that's correct. So τ_tau = BR * τ_mu * (m_mu/m_tau)^5.\n\nSo plugging in:\n\nBR =0.16, τ_mu=2.2e-6 s, m_mu=106, m_tau=1784.\n\nSo (m_mu/m_tau)^5 = (106/1784)^5 ≈ (0.05943)^5 ≈ compute 0.05943^2 ≈0.00353, then ^4 ≈ (0.00353)^2 ≈1.246e-5, then *0.00353 ≈4.399e-8. Wait, but 0.05943^5.\n\nAlternatively, compute step by step:\n\n0.05943^2 ≈0.05943 *0.05943 ≈0.00353.\n\n0.05943^3 ≈0.00353 *0.05943≈0.0002098.\n\n0.05943^4 ≈0.0002098 *0.05943≈0.00001247.\n\n0.05943^5 ≈0.00001247 *0.05943≈7.41e-7.\n\nSo (m_mu/m_tau)^5 ≈7.41e-7.\n\nThen τ_tau =0.16 *2.2e-6 *7.41e-7.\n\nCompute 0.16 *2.2e-6 =0.352e-6.\n\nThen 0.352e-6 *7.41e-7 =0.352*7.41 *1e-13 ≈2.608 *1e-13 ≈2.608e-13 s.\n\nWhich is approximately 2.6e-13 seconds, which is close to the known value of the tau lifetime (~2.9e-13 s). So this seems correct.\n\nTherefore, part (a) answer is approximately 2.6e-13 seconds. But let's compute more accurately.\n\nCompute (m_mu/m_tau) =106/1784≈0.05943.\n\nCompute (0.05943)^5:\n\nFirst, compute ln(0.05943)=ln(5.943e-2)=ln(5.943)+ln(1e-2)=1.782 -4.605≈-2.823.\n\nMultiply by 5: -14.115.\n\nExponentiate: e^-14.115≈e^-14 / e^0.115≈(8.318e-7)/1.122≈7.41e-7. So same as before.\n\nSo τ_tau=0.16 *2.2e-6 *7.41e-7.\n\nMultiply 0.16 *2.2=0.352.\n\nMultiply 0.352e-6 *7.41e-7=0.352*7.41=2.60832, so 2.60832e-13 s.\n\nSo approximately 2.61e-13 seconds. Rounding to two significant figures, since the branching ratio is given as 16% (two sig figs), and masses are given as three sig figs (106, 1784). But the muon lifetime is given as 2.2e-6 (two sig figs). So the final answer should have two sig figs: 2.6e-13 s.\n\nBut let me check the exact calculation:\n\n0.16 *2.2e-6 * (106/1784)^5.\n\nCompute 106/1784 = 0.05943.\n\n0.05943^5 = (0.05943)^2 * (0.05943)^3 ≈0.00353 *0.0002098≈0.000000741.\n\nSo 0.16 *2.2e-6 *7.41e-7 =0.16*2.2*7.41 *1e-13= (0.16*2.2)=0.352; 0.352*7.41≈2.608.\n\nSo 2.608e-13 s ≈2.6e-13 s.\n\nSo the answer is approximately 2.6e-13 seconds.\n\nNow part (b): If the τ⁺ is produced in a colliding beam accelerator, e+ e- → τ+ τ- at E_em=29 GeV (the center-of-mass energy?), and the e+ and e- have equal and opposite momenta. Find the mean distance the τ+ travels before decaying.\n\nMean distance would be the lab frame distance: velocity times lifetime. But since the τ is moving relativistically, we need to compute its velocity and then multiply by gamma*c*tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.\n\nBut first, the τ is produced in the e+ e- collision. The center-of-mass energy is 29 GeV. The process is e+ e- → τ+ τ-.\n\nAssuming the τ is produced at rest? No, in the center-of-mass frame, the τ+ and τ- would have equal and opposite momenta. But the problem states that the e+ and e- have equal and opposite momenta, so the lab frame is the center-of-mass frame. Therefore, the τ's are produced with some energy and momentum in the lab frame.\n\nWait, the problem says \"e+ and e- have equal and opposite momenta\", so the lab frame is the center-of-mass frame. Therefore, the τ's are produced at rest? No, because the center-of-mass energy is 29 GeV, which is much larger than the τ mass (1.784 GeV). So each τ would have energy E = sqrt(p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4). But in the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum is zero, so the τ+ and τ- must have equal and opposite momenta. Therefore, each τ would have energy E = sqrt(p^2 c^2 + m_tau^2 c^4), and since the total energy is 29 GeV, each τ would have energy 29/2 GeV =14.5 GeV.\n\nWait, but the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is 29 GeV. So each beam must have energy 14.5 GeV, but since electrons are much lighter than the tau, the actual production would require that the center-of-mass energy is sufficient to produce two taus. The threshold energy for e+ e- → τ+ τ- is when the center-of-mass energy is at least 2*m_tau*c² = 2*1.784 GeV =3.568 GeV. Since 29 GeV is much higher than this, the taus are produced relativistically.\n\nIn the center-of-mass frame, each tau has energy E_tau = sqrt( (p_tau c)^2 + (m_tau c²)^2 ). But since the total energy is 29 GeV, and the taus are produced back-to-back with equal energy, each tau has energy E_tau =29/2 GeV=14.5 GeV.\n\nTherefore, the momentum of each tau is p_tau c = sqrt(E_tau² - m_tau² c^4)/c² *c = sqrt(E_tau² - m_tau² c^4)/c.\n\nWait, let's compute it properly.\n\nGiven E_tau =14.5 GeV, m_tau c²=1.784 GeV.\n\nSo, (p_tau c)^2 = E_tau² - (m_tau c²)^2 = (14.5)^2 - (1.784)^2 ≈210.25 -3.183≈207.067 (GeV)^2.\n\nSo p_tau c ≈sqrt(207.067)≈14.39 GeV.\n\nTherefore, p_tau =14.39 GeV /c.\n\nThe velocity v of the tau is (p_tau c²)/(E_tau c) = (14.39 GeV *c )/(14.5 GeV) ) ≈ (14.39/14.5)c ≈0.9924c.\n\nGamma factor (γ) is E_tau/(m_tau c²)=14.5/1.784≈8.13.\n\nThe mean lifetime in the lab frame (which is the center-of-mass frame here) is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime tau_tau.\n\nSo the mean distance traveled is v * gamma * tau_tau.\n\nBut wait, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma*tau_tau, so the distance is v * gamma * tau_tau *c? Wait, no. Wait, the lifetime is dilated by gamma, so the lab frame lifetime is gamma*tau_tau. The speed is v, so the distance is v * gamma * tau_tau.\n\nBut let's check units. tau_tau is in seconds. v is in m/s. So distance is meters.\n\nBut let's compute:\n\nv ≈0.9924c.\n\ngamma ≈8.13.\n\ntau_tau from part (a) is 2.6e-13 seconds.\n\nSo distance L = v * gamma * tau_tau.\n\nBut v =0.9924c ≈0.9924*3e8 m/s≈2.977e8 m/s.\n\ngamma=8.13.\n\ntau_tau=2.6e-13 s.\n\nSo L=0.9924*3e8 *8.13*2.6e-13.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n0.9924*3e8 ≈2.977e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 8.13: 2.977e8 *8.13≈2.977e8 *8 +2.977e8 *0.13≈2.382e9 +3.87e7≈2.4207e9 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 2.6e-13 s: 2.4207e9 *2.6e-13 ≈6.294e-4 meters ≈0.6294 millimeters.\n\nSo approximately 0.63 mm.\n\nBut let's compute more accurately.\n\nFirst, compute gamma:\n\nE_tau =14.5 GeV, m_tau c²=1.784 GeV.\n\ngamma = E_tau/(m_tau c²)=14.5/1.784≈8.13.\n\nv = (pc²)/(E c) = (14.39 GeV *c )/(14.5 GeV) ) = (14.39/14.5)c ≈0.99234c.\n\nSo beta = v/c ≈0.99234.\n\ngamma=8.13.\n\nSo beta*gamma ≈0.99234*8.13≈8.07.\n\nThen, L= beta*gamma*c*tau_tau.\n\nc=3e8 m/s.\n\ntau_tau=2.6e-13 s.\n\nSo L=8.07 *3e8 m/s *2.6e-13 s.\n\nCompute 8.07*3=24.21.\n\n24.21 *2.6=62.946.\n\nSo 62.946e-5 meters =62.946e-5 m =0.00062946 meters ≈0.6295 mm.\n\nSo approximately 0.63 mm.\n\nBut let's check the exact numbers.\n\nFrom part (a), tau_tau=2.6e-13 s.\n\nBut if we use the precise value from part (a), which was 2.608e-13 s, then:\n\nbeta*gamma=8.07.\n\nL=8.07 *3e8 *2.608e-13.\n\nCompute 8.07*3e8=2.421e9.\n\n2.421e9 *2.608e-13=2.421*2.608 *1e-4≈6.313 *1e-4 m≈0.6313 mm.\n\nSo approximately 0.63 mm.\n\nBut the problem says \"mean distance (in the laboratory)\", and the lab frame here is the center-of-mass frame where the taus are moving with velocity 0.992c. So the mean distance is about 0.63 mm.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the collider is a colliding beam accelerator, like PEP, where e+ and e- have equal and opposite momenta. So the lab frame is indeed the center-of-mass frame. Therefore, the calculation above is correct.\n\nBut let me confirm the steps again:\n\n1. Find the velocity of the tau in the lab (center-of-mass) frame.\n\n2. Compute gamma factor.\n\n3. Multiply velocity, gamma, and proper lifetime to get the mean path length.\n\nYes, because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma*tau, and the speed is v, so distance is v*gamma*tau.\n\nAlternatively, distance = gamma*v*tau.\n\nBut since v=beta*c, then distance=gamma*beta*c*tau= (gamma*beta)*c*tau.\n\nBut gamma*beta= (E/(m c²)) * (p c)/(E) )= p/(m c). So gamma*beta= p/(m c).\n\nBut p=14.39 GeV/c, m=1.784 GeV/c².\n\nSo gamma*beta= (14.39 GeV/c)/(1.784 GeV/c² *c ) *c=14.39/(1.784)≈8.07.\n\nWhich matches the previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, L=gamma*beta*c*tau.\n\nBut c*tau is the distance light travels in one tau lifetime: 3e8 m/s *2.6e-13 s=7.8e-5 m=0.078 mm.\n\nThen multiplied by gamma*beta≈8.07 gives 0.078 mm *8.07≈0.629 mm.\n\nSo yes, approximately 0.63 mm.\n\nBut the problem might expect more precise calculation. Let's use exact numbers.\n\nGiven E_em=29 GeV, which is the center-of-mass energy. Each tau has energy E_tau=14.5 GeV.\n\nm_tau=1.784 GeV/c².\n\nSo gamma=14.5 /1.784≈8.128.\n\np_tau c= sqrt(E_tau² -m_tau²)=sqrt(14.5² -1.784²)=sqrt(210.25 -3.183)=sqrt(207.067)=14.39 GeV.\n\nbeta= p_tau c /E_tau=14.39/14.5≈0.99234.\n\ngamma*beta=8.128*0.99234≈8.07.\n\nc=3e8 m/s.\n\ntau_tau=2.608e-13 s.\n\nL=8.07 *3e8 m/s *2.608e-13 s=8.07*3e8*2.608e-13.\n\nCalculate 3e8*2.608e-13=7.824e-5.\n\nThen 8.07*7.824e-5≈0.000631 meters=0.631 mm.\n\nSo the mean distance is approximately 0.63 mm.\n\nBut the problem says \"mean distance (in the laboratory)\", so the answer is about 0.63 mm. Depending on rounding, maybe 0.63 mm or 0.6 mm. But given the precision of the inputs, two significant figures seems appropriate.\n\nSo part (a) answer is approximately 2.6e-13 seconds, and part (b) is approximately 0.63 mm.\n</think>\n\n(a) The mean life of the τ⁺ can be estimated by comparing its decay rate to that of the μ⁺. Since both decays proceed via the same interaction, their partial decay widths scale with the fifth power of the decaying particle's mass. The branching ratio for τ⁺ → e⁺νν̄ is 16%, so the total decay rate of the τ⁺ is Γ_τ = Γ_τ→eνν̄ / 0.16. Using the muon's mean life τ_μ = 2.2 × 10⁻⁶ s and the mass ratio (m_τ/m_μ) = 1784/106 ≈ 16.83, the τ⁺ mean life is:\n\n\\[\n\\tau_\\tau = \\frac{0.16 \\cdot \\tau_\\mu}{(m_\\tau/m_\\mu)^5} = \\frac{0.16 \\cdot 2.2 \\times 10^{-6}}{(16.83)^5} \\approx 2.6 \\times 10^{-13} \\, \\text{s}.\n\\]\n\n(b) The τ⁺ is produced in the center-of-mass frame with energy E_τ = 14.5 GeV.

{"id": "atomic/4-10", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the Compton wavelength of a proton. Hmm, I remember that the Compton wavelength is a quantum mechanical property of a particle. It's related to the wavelength of a photon whose energy is equal to the rest mass energy of the particle. The formula, if I recall correctly, is λ = h/(m c), where h is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Yes, the Compton wavelength formula is λ = h/(m c). So I need to plug in the values for a proton. Let me jot down the constants. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The mass of a proton m is about 1.67 x 10^-27 kg. The speed of light c is 3 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nSo plugging those numbers into the formula: λ = (6.626 x 10^-34 J·s) / (1.67 x 10^-27 kg * 3 x 10^8 m/s). Let me compute the denominator first. 1.67 x 10^-27 kg multiplied by 3 x 10^8 m/s gives 5.01 x 10^-19 kg·m/s. Then, dividing h by that: 6.626 x 10^-34 / 5.01 x 10^-19 ≈ 1.322 x 10^-15 meters.\n\nWait, converting meters to centimeters. Since 1 meter is 100 centimeters, so 1.322 x 10^-15 meters is 1.322 x 10^-13 centimeters. Oh, so that's around 10^-13 cm. Looking at the options, option (b) is 10^-13 cm. That must be the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculation to be sure. Let's recalculate the denominator: 1.67e-27 kg * 3e8 m/s = 5.01e-19 kg·m/s. Then h is 6.626e-34 J·s. J is kg·m²/s², so J·s is kg·m²/s. So when we divide h (kg·m²/s) by (kg·m/s), we get meters, which makes sense. So 6.626e-34 / 5.01e-19 = approximately 1.32e-15 meters. Convert to centimeters by multiplying by 100 (since 1 m = 100 cm), so 1.32e-15 m = 1.32e-13 cm. Yep, that's 10^-13 cm.

{"id": "atomic/1-4", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to estimate the electric field required to pull an electron out of an atom in a time comparable to the electron's orbital period around the nucleus. Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic concepts. \n\nFirst, the time it takes for an electron to orbit the nucleus. I remember that in the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, the electron's orbital period is on the order of femtoseconds. Let me check that. The formula for the orbital period in the Bohr model is T = (2πr)/v, where r is the radius of the orbit and v is the speed of the electron. For the ground state, the radius r is the Bohr radius, approximately 0.5 angstroms or 5.29e-11 meters. The speed v is about 2.2e6 m/s. Plugging those in: T = (2 * π * 5.29e-11 m) / (2.2e6 m/s). Let me calculate that. \n\n2 * π * 5.29e-11 ≈ 3.32e-10, divided by 2.2e6 gives T ≈ 1.5e-16 seconds. So that's about 150 attoseconds, which is indeed in the femtosecond range. Wait, 1e-15 seconds is a femtosecond, so 1.5e-16 is 0.15 femtoseconds. Maybe I should double-check the numbers. Alternatively, maybe using a classical approach here is okay for an estimate.\n\nNow, the electric field needed to ionize the atom in that time. The idea is that the electric force should do enough work over the displacement of the electron to give it the necessary energy to escape the atom. The ionization energy for hydrogen is about 13.6 eV. So the work done by the electric field should be at least equal to the ionization energy. Work done is force times distance. The electric force is E * e, where E is the electric field and e is the electron charge. The distance the electron moves during the time T would be approximately the displacement under the electric field's acceleration. Wait, but if the electric field is applied for a time T, the electron will accelerate, so the displacement isn't just linear. Hmm, maybe I need to consider the acceleration.\n\nAlternatively, using energy considerations. The kinetic energy imparted by the electric field should be enough to overcome the binding energy. The work done by the electric field is E * e * d, where d is the distance over which the field acts. If the time is T, then the distance d can be approximated by the motion under the electric field. But since the electron is initially bound, maybe we can model this as a sudden application of the electric field that imparts enough energy in time T.\n\nAlternatively, using the impulse-momentum theorem. The impulse J = F * Δt = Δp. The force F is e * E. So e * E * T = Δp. The change in momentum Δp would need to be enough to give the electron sufficient kinetic energy to escape. The kinetic energy (KE) is (Δp)^2 / (2m_e). Setting KE equal to the ionization energy (13.6 eV):\n\n( (e E T)^2 ) / (2 m_e) = 13.6 eV\n\nSolving for E:\n\nE = sqrt( 2 m_e * 13.6 eV ) / (e T )\n\nBut wait, let's check the units. eV is energy, so 13.6 eV = 13.6 * 1.6e-19 J. m_e is the electron mass, 9.11e-31 kg. e is 1.6e-19 C. T is the time, which we estimated as ~1.5e-16 s.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nFirst compute the numerator: sqrt( 2 * 9.11e-31 kg * 13.6 * 1.6e-19 J )\n\nLet's compute 2 * 9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30\n\nMultiply by 13.6 * 1.6e-19: 13.6 * 1.6 = 21.76, so 21.76e-19. So 1.822e-30 * 21.76e-19 = 1.822 * 21.76e-49 ≈ 39.64e-49 = 3.964e-48\n\nTake the square root: sqrt(3.964e-48) ≈ 6.3e-24\n\nThen divide by (e T): (1.6e-19 C * 1.5e-16 s) = 2.4e-35 C·s\n\nSo E ≈ 6.3e-24 / 2.4e-35 ≈ 2.625e11 V/m\n\nWait, that's 2.6e11 V/m. That seems really high, but maybe that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the approach is different.\n\nAnother approach: The electric field E exerts a force F = eE on the electron. The acceleration a = F/m_e = eE/m_e. Over a time T, the displacement d is 0.5 * a * T^2. The work done by the field is F * d = eE * 0.5 * (eE/m_e) * T^2 = 0.5 * e^2 E^2 T^2 / m_e. Setting this equal to the ionization energy (13.6 eV):\n\n0.5 * (e^2 E^2 T^2) / m_e = 13.6 eV\n\nSolving for E:\n\nE = sqrt( (2 * m_e * 13.6 eV) ) / (e T )\n\nWait, this is the same equation as before. So the calculation is correct, leading to E ≈ 2.6e11 V/m. That's 2.6 x 10^11 V/m. Let me check if that's a reasonable number. \n\nI recall that the electric field experienced by an electron in a hydrogen atom is on the order of e/(4πε0 r^2). Let's compute that. For r = 5.29e-11 m:\n\nE_atom = (1.6e-19 C) / (4 * π * 8.85e-12 C²/N·m² * (5.29e-11 m)^2 )\n\nFirst compute denominator: 4π*8.85e-12 ≈ 1.11e-10. Then (5.29e-11)^2 ≈ 2.8e-21. So denominator is 1.11e-10 * 2.8e-21 ≈ 3.11e-31. Then E_atom ≈ 1.6e-19 / 3.11e-31 ≈ 5.14e11 V/m. So the electric field in the atom is about 5e11 V/m. The value we calculated (2.6e11 V/m) is about half of that. That seems plausible because the external field required to pull the electron out in a time comparable to the orbital period would need to be comparable to the internal atomic field. So maybe the answer is around 1e11 to 1e12 V/m. But according to the calculation, 2.6e11 V/m. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the displacement is not 0.5 a T^2 but something else. If the electron is moving in a circular orbit, and the electric field is applied impulsively, perhaps the displacement is a full a T^2. Let me check. If the acceleration is a, then the displacement in time T is d = 0.5 a T². But if the electron is already moving, maybe the displacement is different. However, since the electric field is applied in a direction, and the electron's initial velocity is perpendicular, maybe the displacement is indeed 0.5 a T² in the direction of the field. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the energy approach is better. The kinetic energy gained from the electric field in time T. The velocity gained is a*T = (eE/m_e)*T. The kinetic energy is 0.5 m_e (v)^2 = 0.5 m_e (e E T / m_e)^2 = 0.5 (e^2 E² T²)/m_e. Setting this equal to 13.6 eV:\n\n0.5 (e² E² T²)/m_e = 13.6 eV\n\nWhich again gives the same equation. So the calculation seems consistent. Therefore, the electric field E is sqrt(2 m_e * 13.6 eV) / (e T). \n\nPlugging in the numbers again:\n\n13.6 eV = 13.6 * 1.6e-19 J = 2.176e-18 J\n\nSo numerator inside sqrt: 2 * 9.11e-31 kg * 2.176e-18 J = 2 * 9.11e-31 * 2.176e-18 = 2 * 19.82e-49 = 39.64e-49. sqrt(39.64e-49) = 6.3e-24 kg·m/s\n\nDenominator: e*T = 1.6e-19 C * 1.5e-16 s = 2.4e-35 C·s\n\nSo E = 6.3e-24 / 2.4e-35 ≈ 2.625e11 V/m\n\nYes, so approximately 3e11 V/m. But maybe the orbital period is different. Let me check the Bohr model period again. The formula for the period in the Bohr model is T = (n^3 * h^3)/(4 π ε0^2 e^4 m_e^2) for the nth orbit. For n=1, the ground state, T = (h^3)/(4 π ε0^2 e^4 m_e^2). Let me compute that. \n\nPlanck's constant h = 6.626e-34 J·s\n\nε0 = 8.85e-12 C²/N·m²\n\ne = 1.6e-19 C\n\nm_e = 9.11e-31 kg\n\nSo T = (6.626e-34)^3 / (4 * π * (8.85e-12)^2 * (1.6e-19)^4 * (9.11e-31)^2 )\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe there's a known value. Alternatively, the orbital frequency f is about 6.6e15 Hz, so T = 1/f ≈ 1.5e-16 s, which matches the previous calculation. So T ≈ 1.5e-16 s is correct.\n\nTherefore, the electric field E ≈ 2.6e11 V/m. Rounding up, maybe 3e11 V/m. But let's see if there's another approach. \n\nAlternatively, using the concept of the electric field required to ionize the atom in a single cycle of the laser (if we think in terms of laser pulses). For example, in strong field ionization, the electric field needed is on the order of the atomic field. Since the atomic electric field is ~5e11 V/m, as calculated earlier, then an external field of similar magnitude would be required to ionize the atom in a time comparable to the orbital period. So our calculation of ~3e11 V/m is in the same ballpark. \n\nTherefore, the estimated electric field is approximately 3 x 10^11 V/m.\n</think>\n\nTo estimate the electric field needed to pull an electron out of an atom in a time comparable to its orbital period, we start by determining the orbital period \\( T \\) of the electron in the Bohr model. For the ground state of hydrogen:\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{2\\pi r}{v} = \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}}{2.2 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{m/s}} \\approx 1.5 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we equate the work done by the electric field to the ionization energy (13.6 eV). The work done is \\( W = e E d \\), where \\( d \\) is the displacement under acceleration \\( a = \\frac{eE}{m_e} \\). Using kinematic equations, \\( d = \\frac{1}{2} a T^2 \\). Substituting \\( d \\) into the work equation and solving for \\( E \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{e^2 E^2 T^2}{m_e} = 13.6 \\, \\text{eV}.\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\( E \\):\n\n\\[\nE = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 m_e \\cdot 13.6 \\, \\text{eV}}{e^2 T^2}}.\n\\]\n\nPlugging in constants (\\( m_e = 9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\text{kg}, \\, e = 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C}, \\, T = 1.5 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s} \\)):\n\n\\[\nE \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\cdot 9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\cdot 2.18 \\times 10^{-18}}{(1.6 \\times 10^{-19})^2 \\cdot (1.5 \\times 10^{-16})^2}} \\approx 2.6 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{V/m}.\n\\]\n\nThis result aligns with the atomic electric field magnitude, confirming its validity.

{"id": "atomic/3-53", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out a test for parity conservation in the decay Lambda^0 → p + π^-. Hmm, parity conservation... Right, parity is a symmetry property related to spatial inversion. If a process conserves parity, then the mirror image of the process should occur with the same probability. But in weak interactions, parity is not conserved, right? So this decay must be a weak interaction since Lambda is a hyperon, and hyperon decays are typically weak. Wait, but how do we test parity conservation here?\n\nLet me recall. For parity conservation, the angular distribution of the decay products should be symmetric in some way. Maybe the polarization of the Lambda particle plays a role here. Since Lambda is a spin-1/2 particle, if it's polarized, the decay products' distribution would depend on the angle relative to the spin direction. If parity is conserved, there might be a certain symmetry in the angular distribution.\n\nWait, the parity operator reverses spatial coordinates, so if the interaction conserves parity, the angular distribution should not have a term that is a pseudoscalar. For example, terms like the scalar product of a momentum vector and a spin vector (which is a pseudoscalar) would change sign under parity. If the decay distribution depends on such a term, that would indicate parity violation.\n\nSo the idea is to look at the angular distribution of the proton relative to the Lambda's spin direction. If the distribution is isotropic, that might suggest parity conservation, but if there's an asymmetry (like more protons emitted in the direction of the spin or opposite), that would violate parity.\n\nBut how do you measure the spin direction of the Lambda? Since Lambda is produced in some process, maybe in a reaction that polarizes it. For example, if Lambda is produced in a reaction like π^- + p → K^+ + Λ^0, the Lambda might be polarized perpendicular to the production plane. Then, when it decays, the direction of the proton's momentum relative to the polarization direction can be measured.\n\nThe decay parameter would be the angle between the proton's momentum (in the Lambda rest frame) and the Lambda's spin direction. If parity is conserved, the distribution would be symmetric around 90 degrees, meaning the number of protons emitted at angle θ and π - θ would be the same. If there's an asymmetry, like more protons emitted in the forward or backward direction relative to the spin, that would indicate parity violation.\n\nMathematically, the angular distribution would be something like dN/dΩ ∝ 1 + α P cosθ, where α is a parameter that measures the parity violation. If α is non-zero, parity is violated. Here, P is the polarization of the Lambda. If parity were conserved, α would be zero, and the distribution would be isotropic. But since weak interactions violate parity, we expect α to be non-zero.\n\nSo the test is to measure the angular distribution of the decay proton relative to the Lambda's spin direction. If there's an asymmetry (α ≠ 0), parity is not conserved. But if the distribution is symmetric (α = 0), parity is conserved.\n\nNow, the circumstances that might prevent this test from being useful. Well, if the Lambda particles are not polarized, then even if parity is violated, there would be no observable asymmetry because the polarization P is zero. The term α P cosθ would average out to zero if the Lambdas are unpolarized. So the test requires that the Lambda particles are polarized. If the production mechanism doesn't polarize them, the test can't be performed. Another issue could be if the detector has an asymmetry in detecting particles in different directions, which could mimic or obscure the true angular distribution. Also, if the sample size is too small, statistical fluctuations might make it hard to determine if there's a real asymmetry.\n\nSo summarizing: The test involves measuring the angular asymmetry of the proton relative to the Lambda's spin. Parity violation would show up as a forward-backward asymmetry. The test's usefulness is hindered if the Lambda isn't polarized, if there's detector bias, or insufficient statistics.\n</think>\n\nTo test for parity conservation in the decay \\(\\Lambda^0 \\rightarrow p + \\pi^-\\), one examines the angular distribution of the proton relative to the \\(\\Lambda^0\\)'s spin polarization. If parity is conserved, the distribution should be symmetric under spatial inversion, meaning no preference for the proton's emission direction relative to the spin. However, weak interactions (governing this decay) violate parity, leading to an asymmetry. The angular distribution is parameterized as:  \n\\[\n\\frac{dN}{d\\Omega} \\propto 1 + \\alpha P \\cos\\theta,\n\\]  \nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) quantifies parity violation (non-zero if violated), \\(P\\) is the \\(\\Lambda^0\\)'s polarization, and \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between the proton's momentum (in the \\(\\Lambda^0\\) rest frame) and the spin direction. A measured asymmetry (\\(\\alpha \\neq 0\\)) indicates parity violation.  \n\n**Circumstances hindering the test**:  \n1. **Unpolarized \\(\\Lambda^0\\)**: If the \\(\\Lambda^0\\) is unpolarized (\\(P = 0\\)), the asymmetry term vanishes, making the test inconclusive.  \n2. **Detector biases**: Uneven detection efficiency for different angles could mimic or mask the true asymmetry.  \n3. **Low statistics**: Insufficient data may obscure the asymmetry due to statistical fluctuations.  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Measure angular asymmetry of proton relative to polarized } \\Lambda^0 \\text{ spin; test fails if } \\Lambda^0 \\text{ is unpolarized or detector biases exist.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Measure angular asymmetry of proton relative to polarized } \\Lambda^0 \\text{ spin; test fails if } \\Lambda^0 \\text{ is unpolarized or detector biases exist.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Measure angular asymmetry of proton relative to polarized } \\Lambda^0 \\text{ spin; test fails if } \\Lambda^0 \\text{ is unpolarized or detector biases exist.}", "expr2": "1 + \\alpha P \\cos \\theta"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/4-44", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the maximum momentum of the emitted muon when a pion decays in its rest frame. Let me start by recalling what I know about pion decay. Pions, which are mesons, can decay into a muon and a muon antineutrino, right? The reaction is π⁻ → μ⁻ + ν̄_μ. The mass of the pion is given as 140 MeV, but I should confirm the masses of the muon and neutrino involved here.\n\nWait, the neutrino mass is negligible, right? Neutrinos have very tiny masses, so for the purposes of this calculation, I can probably approximate the neutrino as massless. That should simplify things. The muon mass, though, is significant. Let me check: the muon mass is about 105.7 MeV/c². So m_μ ≈ 105.7 MeV/c², and m_ν ≈ 0.\n\nThe problem is asking for the maximum momentum of the muon in the pion's rest frame. Hmm. In particle decay problems, the maximum momentum occurs when the decay products are emitted in opposite directions to conserve momentum, and when the neutrino (which is massless here) carries away the maximum possible energy, leaving the muon with the minimum possible energy? Wait, no, maybe I need to think in terms of energy and momentum conservation.\n\nSince the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p_μ and the neutrino's momentum as p_ν. Then, p_μ = -p_ν. But since the neutrino is (almost) massless, its energy is E_ν = |p_ν|c. The muon's energy is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E_μ = sqrt( (p_μ c)^2 + (m_μ c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no. Wait, the energy for a particle is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ). So E_μ = sqrt( (p_μ c)^2 + (m_μ c²)^2 ), and E_ν = p_ν c, since m_ν ≈ 0.\n\nConservation of energy gives E_μ + E_ν = m_π c². But since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest energy, which is m_π c². So:\n\nsqrt( (p_μ c)^2 + (m_μ c²)^2 ) + p_ν c = m_π c².\n\nBut from conservation of momentum, since the pion is at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must cancel each other. So p_μ = -p_ν. Therefore, their magnitudes are equal: |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p. Let's let p be the magnitude of the muon's momentum. Then, p_ν = p (but in the opposite direction). So substituting into the energy equation:\n\nsqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_μ c²)^2 ) + p c = m_π c².\n\nLet me divide both sides by c² to make the units simpler. Let me denote terms in units where c=1 (energy and mass in MeV, momentum in MeV/c). Then the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt( p² + m_μ² ) + p = m_π.\n\nSo sqrt(p² + m_μ²) = m_π - p.\n\nNow, square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\np² + m_μ² = (m_π - p)^2.\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\nm_π² - 2 m_π p + p².\n\nSubtract p² from both sides:\n\nm_μ² = m_π² - 2 m_π p.\n\nThen, solving for p:\n\n2 m_π p = m_π² - m_μ².\n\nSo p = (m_π² - m_μ²)/(2 m_π).\n\nPlugging in the numbers: m_π = 140 MeV/c², m_μ = 105.7 MeV/c².\n\nCompute numerator: (140)^2 - (105.7)^2.\n\nLet me calculate that. 140 squared is 19600. 105.7 squared: 105.7 * 105.7. Let's compute that:\n\n100^2 = 10000, 5.7^2 = 32.49, and cross term 2*100*5.7 = 1140. So total is 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.\n\nSo numerator is 19600 - 11172.49 = 8427.51.\n\nDenominator is 2 * 140 = 280.\n\nSo p = 8427.51 / 280 ≈ let's compute that.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 7: 8427.51 ÷7 ≈ 1203.93, 280 ÷7 = 40. So 1203.93 /40 ≈ 30.098 MeV/c.\n\nWait, but that's approximately 30.1 MeV/c. But the options given are (a) 30, (b)70, (c)2.7. So option (a) is 30. But wait, the answer I get is approximately 30.1, which is close to 30. But wait, maybe I made a calculation error. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, m_π is 140, m_μ is 105.7. So m_π squared is 140*140=19600. m_μ squared is 105.7*105.7. Let me compute that more accurately.\n\n105.7 * 105.7:\n\nFirst, 100*100=10000.\n\n100*5.7=570, so 100*105.7=10570.\n\n5.7*100=570, 5.7*5.7=32.49.\n\nSo 105.7*105.7 = (100 + 5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.\n\nSo 19600 - 11172.49 = 8427.51.\n\nDivide by 2*140=280: 8427.51 /280 ≈ 30.098. So approximately 30.1 MeV/c. So answer (a) 30 MeV/c. But wait, the options are (a) 30, (b)70, (c)2.7. So why is the answer not (a)? But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. The maximum momentum of the muon. Wait, but in the rest frame of the pion, when the neutrino is emitted in one direction and the muon in the opposite, but since the neutrino is massless, does that affect the maximum momentum? Wait, perhaps the maximum momentum occurs when the muon is emitted in the direction opposite to the neutrino, but how does that affect the momentum?\n\nWait, but in the rest frame, the momenta must be equal and opposite. So the muon's momentum is p, and the neutrino's momentum is p in the opposite direction. So the formula I used should be correct. So the calculation gives approximately 30.1 MeV/c, which is answer (a). But the options given include (b)70. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. The formula for the momentum in a two-body decay where one particle is massless. The general formula when a particle of mass M decays into two particles of masses m1 and m2. The momentum of each particle in the rest frame is given by:\n\np = [M² - (m1 + m2)^2][M² - (m1 - m2)^2]/(4 M²) )^½ / (2 M)\n\nWait, but if one of the masses is zero, say m2=0, then the formula simplifies. Let me check.\n\nIf m2=0, then the expression under the square root becomes [M² - m1²]^2, so the square root is M² - m1². Then p = (M² - m1²)/(2 M). Which is exactly the formula I used. So p = (m_π² - m_μ²)/(2 m_π). So that's correct. So substituting the numbers, as before, gives approximately 30.1 MeV/c. So answer (a) 30 MeV/c.\n\nBut wait, the given options are (a) 30, (b)70, (c)2.7. So why is the answer not (a)? Wait, maybe I miscalculated the squares. Let me check again.\n\nm_π = 140, m_μ = 105.7.\n\nm_π squared: 140*140 = 19600.\n\nm_μ squared: 105.7*105.7. Let's compute this again.\n\n105 * 105 = 11025.\n\n105 * 0.7 = 73.5.\n\n0.7 * 105 = 73.5.\n\n0.7 * 0.7 = 0.49.\n\nSo (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 +0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49. So that's correct.\n\n19600 - 11172.49 = 8427.51.\n\nDivide by 2*140 = 280: 8427.51 /280 = 30.098. So approximately 30.1 MeV/c. So answer (a) 30. But wait, the options are (a) 30, (b)70, (c)2.7. So why is the answer (a)? But maybe the actual calculation gives exactly 30.1, which rounds to 30. So answer (a). But wait, the possible answers are given as (a) 30, (b)70, (c)2.7. So (a) is correct. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes in these decay problems, there's a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum momentum occurs when the muon is emitted with maximum possible energy, which would correspond to the neutrino carrying away the least energy. Wait, but in two-body decay, the energies and momenta are fixed. Wait, no, wait: pion is spin-0, so the decay must conserve angular momentum. But since the pion is spin-0, the muon and neutrino must be emitted with opposite spins. But maybe that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, but in the rest frame of the pion, the muon and neutrino must have opposite momenta. So their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Therefore, the muon's momentum is fixed once the masses are known. So the calculation should be correct. Therefore, the answer should be (a) 30 MeV/c. But the options given include (b)70. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, let me check another approach. Let's use energy and momentum conservation again.\n\nIn the pion rest frame, total energy is m_π c². The muon and neutrino share this energy. The muon's energy is E_μ = sqrt( p² c^4 + m_μ² c^4 ) / c²? Wait, no. Wait, E_μ = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_μ c²)^2 ). Similarly, E_ν = p_ν c. Since momentum is conserved, p_μ = -p_ν, so |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p. Therefore, E_μ + E_ν = m_π c². So:\n\nsqrt( p² c^2 + m_μ² c^4 ) + p c = m_π c².\n\nDivide both sides by c:\n\nsqrt( p² + m_μ² c² ) + p = m_π c.\n\nWait, but units here might be confusing. Let me use natural units where c=1. Then the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt( p² + m_μ² ) + p = m_π.\n\nWhich is the same as before. Then solving for p gives p = (m_π² - m_μ²)/(2 m_π). So same result. So the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is approximately 30 MeV/c, which is option (a). But why is option (b) 70 present? Maybe I made a mistake in the mass of the muon. Let me check the muon mass. The muon mass is approximately 105.7 MeV/c². Yes, that's correct. So 105.7 is correct. Then the calculation is correct. So answer (a).\n\nWait, but maybe the question is about the maximum possible momentum. Wait, but in the rest frame of the pion, the momentum of the muon is fixed. Because in a two-body decay, the momenta of the decay products are determined uniquely by conservation laws. So there's only one possible momentum magnitude for the muon. Therefore, the maximum momentum is the same as the only possible momentum. So the answer is (a) 30 MeV/c. Therefore, the correct answer should be (a). But the options given include (b)70. Maybe the question is in a different frame? Wait, no, the question specifies the pion rest frame. So I think the answer is (a). But let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering relativistic speeds and using gamma factors incorrectly. Wait, but no, the approach taken is correct. The formula derived is standard for two-body decay when one particle is massless. So I think the answer is (a). Therefore, the correct answer is (a) 30 MeV/c.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the maximum momentum of the muon emitted in the pion's rest frame, we use energy and momentum conservation. The pion (mass \\( m_\\pi = 140 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2 \\)) decays into a muon (mass \\( m_\\mu = 105.7 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2 \\)) and a neutrino (mass \\( m_\\nu \\approx 0 \\)). \n\nIn the pion's rest frame, the total initial momentum is zero.

{"id": "atomic/4-43", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the kinetic energies of the muon (μ) and the neutrino when a K-meson decays at rest. Let me start by recalling what I know about particle decay and conservation laws. Since the K-meson is at rest, the total momentum before decay should be zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Also, energy should be conserved here. \n\nThe rest energy of the K-meson is given as 494 MeV, and the rest energy of the muon is 106 MeV. The neutrino has zero rest energy, which makes sense because neutrinos are considered massless or nearly massless in many contexts. \n\nFirst, let's note that in the rest frame of the K-meson, the total energy before decay is just its rest energy, which is 494 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum times the speed of light (but since we're using natural units where c=1, energy is just |p| for the neutrino). \n\nSo, energy conservation gives:\nE_K = E_μ + E_ν\n\nMomentum conservation tells us that the momentum of the muon (p_μ) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the momentum of the neutrino (p_ν). So, |p_μ| = |p_ν|. Let's denote the magnitude of each as p.\n\nNow, the energy of the muon is the sum of its rest energy and its kinetic energy. But wait, actually, the total energy of the muon is its rest energy plus kinetic energy. So E_μ = m_μ c² + K_μ. But since we're using units where c=1, this simplifies to E_μ = m_μ + K_μ. Similarly, the neutrino's energy is entirely kinetic since it's massless, so E_ν = K_ν = p_ν c = p_ν (again, c=1). \n\nBut maybe it's better to express everything in terms of relativistic energy-momentum relations. The energy of the muon is given by E_μ² = (m_μ c²)² + (p_μ c)². Again, with c=1, this is E_μ² = m_μ² + p_μ². Since the neutrino is massless, E_ν = p_ν. And because momentum is conserved, p_μ = -p_ν, so their magnitudes are equal: p_μ = p_ν = p. \n\nSo substituting into energy conservation:\nE_K = E_μ + E_ν\nBut E_K is the rest energy of the K-meson, which is 494 MeV. So:\n494 MeV = sqrt(m_μ² + p²) + p\n\nHere, m_μ is 106 MeV. Let me plug that in:\n494 = sqrt(106² + p²) + p\n\nThis equation has one variable, p. Let's solve for p. Let me rearrange the equation:\n\nsqrt(106² + p²) = 494 - p\n\nNow, square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n106² + p² = (494 - p)²\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n(494 - p)² = 494² - 2*494*p + p²\n\nSo substituting back:\n106² + p² = 494² - 988p + p²\n\nSubtract p² from both sides:\n106² = 494² - 988p\n\nNow, compute 494² and 106². Let me calculate these:\n\n494 squared: 494*494. Let's compute 500² = 250000, subtract 6*500*2 = 6000, and add 6²=36. Wait, that's (500 - 6)^2 = 500² - 2*500*6 + 6² = 250000 - 6000 + 36 = 244036.\n\nSimilarly, 106² is 11236.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n11236 = 244036 - 988p\n\nNow, subtract 244036 from both sides:\n\n11236 - 244036 = -988p\n\nThat's -232800 = -988p\n\nDivide both sides by -988:\n\np = 232800 / 988\n\nLet me compute that. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n232800 ÷ 4 = 58200\n\n988 ÷ 4 = 247\n\nSo 58200 / 247. Let me compute 247*235 = ?\n\n247*200 = 49400\n\n247*35 = 8645\n\nSo 49400 + 8645 = 58045\n\nThat's 247*235 = 58045. The numerator is 58200, so 58200 - 58045 = 155. So 235 + 155/247 ≈ 235 + 0.6275 ≈ 235.6275. So p ≈ 235.6275 MeV/c. Wait, but since we are using units where c=1, the units for p would be MeV/c, but since energy is in MeV, and E_ν = p, so E_ν is 235.6275 MeV. \n\nBut let me check the calculation again. Maybe I made a mistake in division. Let's compute 232800 ÷ 988. Let's see:\n\n988 * 235 = 988*(200 + 35) = 988*200 + 988*35\n\n988*200 = 197,600\n\n988*35: 988*30=29,640; 988*5=4,940. Total 29,640 + 4,940 = 34,580. So total 197,600 + 34,580 = 232,180. \n\nBut 988*235 = 232,180. The numerator is 232,800. So 232,800 - 232,180 = 620. So 620/988 = 310/494 = 155/247 ≈ 0.6275. So total p ≈ 235 + 0.6275 ≈ 235.6275 MeV/c. \n\nSo p ≈ 235.6275 MeV. Then, the neutrino's energy is E_ν = p ≈ 235.6275 MeV. \n\nNow, the muon's energy is E_μ = sqrt(m_μ² + p²) = sqrt(106² + (235.6275)^2). Let's compute that:\n\n106² = 11,236\n\n235.6275² ≈ (235.6)^2. Let's compute 235^2 = 55,225. 0.6^2 = 0.36. 2*235*0.6 = 282. So 55,225 + 282 + 0.36 = 55,507.36. But actually, 235.6275 is a bit more precise. Let me compute 235.6275^2:\n\nFirst, 235.6275 = 235 + 0.6275\n\n(235 + 0.6275)^2 = 235² + 2*235*0.6275 + 0.6275²\n\n235² = 55,225\n\n2*235*0.6275 = 470 * 0.6275. Let's compute 470*0.6 = 282, 470*0.0275 = 12.925. So total 282 + 12.925 = 294.925\n\n0.6275² ≈ 0.6275*0.6275 ≈ 0.3938\n\nSo total 55,225 + 294.925 + 0.3938 ≈ 55,520.3188\n\nSo E_μ = sqrt(11,236 + 55,520.3188) = sqrt(66,756.3188) ≈ 258.37 MeV\n\nWait, sqrt(66,756.3188). Let me check. 258^2 = 66,564. 259^2 = 67,081. So 258.37^2 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute 258.37^2:\n\n258^2 = 66,564\n\n0.37^2 = 0.1369\n\n2*258*0.37 = 2*258 = 516; 516*0.37 ≈ 190.92\n\nSo total ≈ 66,564 + 190.92 + 0.1369 ≈ 66,755.0569. Close to 66,756.3188. So sqrt(66,756.3188) ≈ 258.37 MeV. \n\nSo E_μ ≈ 258.37 MeV. Then, the kinetic energy of the muon is E_μ - m_μ = 258.37 - 106 = 152.37 MeV. \n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again. Because the neutrino's energy is p ≈ 235.6275 MeV, and the muon's energy is 494 - 235.6275 ≈ 258.3725 MeV. Wait, because E_μ + E_ν = 494. So if E_ν is approximately 235.6275, then E_μ is 494 - 235.6275 ≈ 258.3725 MeV. Then, the kinetic energy of the muon is E_μ - m_μ = 258.3725 - 106 ≈ 152.3725 MeV. \n\nSo the muon's kinetic energy is approximately 152.37 MeV, and the neutrino's kinetic energy is approximately 235.63 MeV. \n\nBut let me check if this makes sense. The total energy should be 494 MeV. 152.37 + 235.63 ≈ 388, but wait, no. Wait, the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino would be K_μ = 152.37 MeV and K_ν = 235.63 MeV. But the total energy is E_μ + E_ν = 258.37 + 235.63 ≈ 494 MeV, which matches. The rest energy of the K-meson is 494 MeV, so energy is conserved. \n\nBut wait, the neutrino's kinetic energy is equal to its total energy because it's massless. So yes, K_ν = E_ν = 235.63 MeV. The muon's kinetic energy is its total energy minus rest energy: 258.37 - 106 = 152.37 MeV. \n\nSo the answer should be K_μ ≈ 152.4 MeV and K_ν ≈ 235.6 MeV. But let me check the exact value of p. \n\nEarlier, we had p = 232800 / 988. Let me compute that exactly. 232800 divided by 988. Let's see:\n\n988 × 235 = 232,180 (as before). 232,800 - 232,180 = 620. So 620 / 988 = 620 ÷ 988. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 4: 155 / 247. Let's compute 155 ÷ 247. \n\n247 × 0.6 = 148.2. 155 - 148.2 = 6.8. 6.8 / 247 ≈ 0.0275. So total p = 235 + 0.6275 ≈ 235.6275. So exact value is 235 + 155/247. Let's keep it as a fraction. \n\nSo p = (232800)/988 = (232800 ÷ 4)/(988 ÷ 4) = 58200/247. Let's see if this can be simplified. 58200 and 247. Let's check if 247 divides into 58200. 247 × 236 = 247*(200 + 36) = 49400 + 8892 = 58,292. Wait, 247*236 = 58,292. But 58,200 is less than that. 58,200 - 247*235 = 58,200 - 58,045 = 155. So 58,200 = 247*235 + 155. So 58200/247 = 235 + 155/247. So p = 235 + 155/247 ≈ 235.6275 MeV. \n\nSo E_ν = p ≈ 235.6275 MeV. Then, E_μ = 494 - 235.6275 ≈ 258.3725 MeV. Then, K_μ = 258.3725 - 106 = 152.3725 MeV. \n\nSo the exact values would be K_μ = (258.3725 - 106) MeV ≈ 152.3725 MeV and K_ν = 235.6275 MeV. \n\nBut let me check if there's a more exact way to represent this. Alternatively, maybe we can express the answer in fractions. Let's see:\n\nFrom the equation:\n\np = (494² - 106²)/(2*494)\n\nWait, let's recall that when you have E = sqrt(m^2 + p^2) + p, then solving for p gives:\n\nE = sqrt(m^2 + p^2) + p\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nsqrt(m^2 + p^2) = E - p\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nm² + p² = E² - 2Ep + p²\n\nCancel p²:\n\nm² = E² - 2Ep\n\nThen, 2Ep = E² - m²\n\nSo p = (E² - m²)/(2E)\n\nIn this case, E is the total energy, which is the rest energy of the K-meson, 494 MeV. m is the rest mass of the muon, 106 MeV. So:\n\np = (494² - 106²)/(2*494)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n494² - 106² = (494 - 106)(494 + 106) = (388)(600) = 232,800\n\nSo p = 232,800 / (2*494) = 232,800 / 988 = same as before, 235.6275 MeV. \n\nSo this formula gives p = (E_K² - m_μ²)/(2 E_K). So that's a quicker way. \n\nTherefore, the momentum p is (494² - 106²)/(2*494) = 232800/988 ≈ 235.6275 MeV. \n\nThen, the neutrino's energy is p ≈ 235.6275 MeV. \n\nThe muon's energy is E_μ = sqrt(m_μ² + p²) = sqrt(106² + (235.6275)^2). But since E_μ = E_K - E_ν = 494 - 235.6275 ≈ 258.3725 MeV. \n\nSo the kinetic energy of the muon is E_μ - m_μ = 258.3725 - 106 = 152.3725 MeV. \n\nTherefore, rounding to reasonable decimal places, the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 152.4 MeV and the neutrino's kinetic energy is approximately 235.6 MeV. \n\nBut let me check if there's a more precise way to write this. For example, using fractions. \n\nSince p = 232800/988 MeV. Let's simplify 232800/988. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 4: 58200/247. 247 is a prime number? Let's check: 247 ÷ 13 = 19. So 13 × 19 = 247. So 58200 ÷ 13 = 58200/13. Let's compute 13 × 4476 = 58,188. 58200 - 58,188 = 12. So 58200 = 13×4476 + 12. Therefore, 58200/247 = (13×4476 + 12)/(13×19) = [4476/19] + 12/(13×19). 4476 ÷ 19: 19×235 = 4465, remainder 11. So 4476/19 = 235 + 11/19. So overall, 58200/247 = 235 + 11/19 + 12/(13×19) = 235 + (11*13 + 12)/(13×19) = 235 + (143 + 12)/247 = 235 + 155/247. Which is what we had before. So p = 235 + 155/247 ≈ 235.6275 MeV. \n\nSo exact values are fractions, but probably the question expects a decimal answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can compute it more accurately. Let's compute 155/247. \n\n155 ÷ 247. Let's do this division:\n\n247 goes into 155 zero times. Add a decimal point. 247 goes into 1550 6 times (6*247=1482). 1550 - 1482 = 68. Bring down a zero: 680. 247 goes into 680 2 times (2*247=494). 680 - 494 = 186. Bring down a zero: 1860. 247 goes into 1860 7 times (7*247=1729). 1860 - 1729 = 131. Bring down a zero: 1310. 247 goes into 1310 5 times (5*247=1235). 1310 - 1235 = 75. Bring down a zero: 750. 247 goes into 750 3 times (3*247=741). 750 - 741 = 9. So the decimal is approximately 0.6275... So 155/247 ≈ 0.6275. \n\nTherefore, p ≈ 235.6275 MeV. \n\nSo the neutrino's kinetic energy is 235.6275 MeV, and the muon's kinetic energy is 152.3725 MeV. \n\nTo check, let's sum them: 235.6275 + 152.3725 = 388 MeV. Wait, but the total energy of the system is 494 MeV. Wait, but the rest energy of the K-meson is 494 MeV. The total energy after decay should be 494 MeV. The muon's total energy is 258.3725 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is 235.6275 MeV. Summing those gives 258.3725 + 235.6275 = 494 MeV, which matches. The kinetic energy of the muon is 152.3725 MeV, and the neutrino's kinetic energy is 235.6275 MeV. So their sum is 152.3725 + 235.6275 = 388 MeV. But that's not the total energy; the total energy includes the rest mass energy of the muon. So the kinetic energies sum to 388 MeV, which is the total energy minus the rest energy of the muon: 494 - 106 = 388 MeV. That checks out. \n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\nK_μ ≈ 152.4 MeV\n\nK_ν ≈ 235.6 MeV\n\nBut let me verify once more with exact calculation. \n\nAlternatively, using exact fractions:\n\np = (494² - 106²)/(2*494) = (494 - 106)(494 + 106)/(2*494) = (388)(600)/(988) = (388*600)/988\n\nSimplify 388 and 988: 388 = 4*97, 988 = 4*247. So (4*97*600)/(4*247) = (97*600)/247 = (97*600)/247\n\nCompute 97*600 = 58,200. Then, 58,200 / 247 = 235.6275... same as before. \n\nSo yes, the exact momentum is 58,200/247 MeV. \n\nBut since the problem asks for the kinetic energies, which are K_μ = E_μ - m_μ = (494 - p) - 106 = 494 - p - 106 = 388 - p. Wait, no:\n\nWait, E_μ = 494 - p. Then K_μ = E_μ - m_μ = (494 - p) - 106 = 388 - p. But p is 235.6275, so 388 - 235.6275 = 152.3725 MeV. \n\nAlternatively, since p = (E_K² - m_μ²)/(2 E_K), then K_μ = E_μ - m_μ = (E_K - p) - m_μ = E_K - m_μ - p. \n\nBut E_K = 494, m_μ = 106, so 494 - 106 = 388. Then K_μ = 388 - p. \n\nSimilarly, K_ν = p. \n\nSo K_μ = 388 - p, K_ν = p. \n\nTherefore, since p = (E_K² - m_μ²)/(2 E_K) = (494² - 106²)/(2*494) = 232800/988 ≈ 235.6275 MeV. \n\nThus, K_μ = 388 - 235.6275 ≈ 152.3725 MeV. \n\nSo the kinetic energies are approximately 152.4 MeV for the muon and 235.6 MeV for the neutrino. \n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just check if there's any other approach. \n\nAlternatively, using relativistic equations for two-body decay. When a particle at rest decays into two particles, one of which is massless, the kinetic energy of the massive particle can be found using the formula:\n\nK = [(M² - m²)/(2M)] - m\n\nWait, no. Wait, the total energy of the massive particle is (M² + m²)/(2M). Wait, let me recall. \n\nIn a two-body decay where the parent is at rest, and one particle is massless, the energy of the massive particle is (M² + m²)/(2M). Then, its kinetic energy would be that minus its rest mass. \n\nLet me verify. \n\nThe energy of the massive particle (muon) is E_μ = (M² + m²)/(2M). Then, K_μ = E_μ - m = (M² + m²)/(2M) - m = [M² + m² - 2Mm]/(2M) = (M - m)^2/(2M). \n\nWait, but in our case, the neutrino is massless. Let me check this formula. \n\nYes, for a decay of a particle of mass M into two particles of mass m and 0, the energy of the massive particle is E_μ = (M² + m²)/(2M). Then, its kinetic energy is K_μ = E_μ - m = (M² + m²)/(2M) - m = (M² + m² - 2Mm)/(2M) = (M - m)^2/(2M). \n\nSimilarly, the energy of the massless particle (neutrino) is E_ν = (M² - m²)/(2M). \n\nLet me apply this formula. \n\nGiven M = 494 MeV (mass of K-meson), m = 106 MeV (mass of muon). \n\nThen, K_μ = (M - m)^2/(2M) = (494 - 106)^2/(2*494) = (388)^2/(988) = (150,544)/(988) ≈ 152.3725 MeV. \n\nWhich matches our previous result. \n\nSimilarly, E_ν = (M² - m²)/(2M) = (494² - 106²)/(2*494) = 232,800/988 ≈ 235.6275 MeV. \n\nSo this confirms the results. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 152.4 MeV and the neutrino's kinetic energy is approximately 235.6 MeV. \n\nThus, the final answers are:\n\nK_μ = \\boxed{152.4 \\text{ MeV}}\n\nK_ν = \\boxed{235.6 \\text{ MeV}}\n\nBut wait, the problem asks to put the final answer in a single box. Wait, the question says \"Find the kinetic energies of the μ and neutrino\". So maybe they want both answers boxed. But the original instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". The example shows one boxed answer. But the problem has two answers. Maybe present both in separate boxes. \n\nBut looking back at the problem statement: \"Find the kinetic energies of the μ and neutrino in a frame in which the K-meson decays at rest.\" So two answers. The user's example shows one box, but maybe in this case, we need two boxes. However, the assistant's instructions say \"Provide the final answer at the end in Latex boxed format\". So perhaps both answers should be boxed. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect the answer as two boxed values. Let me check the example again. The example shows one boxed answer. But the problem here has two answers. So perhaps the assistant should present both in boxed format. \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is \\boxed{152.4 \\text{ MeV}} and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is \\boxed{235.6 \\text{ MeV}}.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects exact fractions, but given the numbers, decimals are more appropriate here. \n\nAlternatively, using exact fractions:\n\nK_μ = (388)^2/(2*494) = (150,544)/(988) = 150,544 ÷ 4 = 37,636; 988 ÷ 4 = 247. So 37,636/247. Let's compute 247 × 152 = 247*(150 + 2) = 247*150 + 247*2 = 37,050 + 494 = 37,544. 37,636 - 37,544 = 92. So 37,636/247 = 152 + 92/247. 92/247 ≈ 0.3725. So 152.3725 MeV. \n\nSimilarly, K_ν = 235 + 155/247 ≈ 235.6275 MeV. \n\nSo the exact values are fractions, but the decimal approximations are sufficient here. \n\nTherefore, the final answers are approximately 152.4 MeV and 235.6 MeV.\n</think>\n\nThe kinetic energies of the muon (μ) and neutrino can be found using conservation of energy and momentum. When the K-meson decays at rest, the total momentum of the system is zero, so the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. \n\nUsing energy conservation:\n\\[\nE_K = E_\\mu + E_\\nu\n\\]\nwhere \\(E_K = 494 \\, \\text{MeV}\\) (rest energy of the K-meson), \\(E_\\mu = \\sqrt{m_\\mu^2 + p^2}\\) (total energy of the muon), and \\(E_\\nu = p\\) (energy of the neutrino, which is massless). \n\nSolving for \\(p\\):\n\\[\n494 = \\sqrt{106^2 + p^2} + p\n\\]\nSquaring both sides and simplifying:\n\\[\n106^2 + p^2 = (494 - p)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n11236 + p^2 = 244036 - 988p + p^2\n\\]\n\\[\n11236 = 244036 - 988p\n\\]\n\\[\n988p = 232800\n\\]\n\\[\np = \\frac{232800}{988} \\approx 235.6 \\, \\text{MeV}\n\\]\n\nThe neutrino's kinetic energy is equal to its momentum:\n\\[\nK_\\nu = p \\approx 235.6 \\, \\text{MeV}\n\\]\n\nThe muon's total energy is:\n\\[\nE_\\mu = 494 - p \\approx 258.4 \\, \\text{MeV}\n\\]\nThus, the muon's kinetic energy is:\n\\[\nK_\\mu = E_\\mu - m_\\mu \\approx 258.4 - 106 = 152.4 \\, \\text{MeV}\n\\]\n\nFinal answers:\n\\[\n\\boxed{152.4 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\quad \\text{(muon)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{235.6 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\quad \\text{(neutrino)}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["152.4 \\text{ MeV}", "235.6 \\text{ MeV}", "152.4 \\text{ MeV}", "235.6 \\text{ MeV}", "152.4 \\, \\text{MeV}", "235.6 \\, \\text{MeV}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "152.4 \\text{ MeV}", "expr2": "T_\\nu = 236 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "152.4 \\text{ MeV}", "expr2": "T_\\mu = 152 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "235.6 \\text{ MeV}", "expr2": "T_\\nu = 236 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "235.6 \\text{ MeV}", "expr2": "T_\\mu = 152 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "152.4 \\text{ MeV}", "expr2": "T_\\nu = 236 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "152.4 \\text{ MeV}", "expr2": "T_\\mu = 152 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "235.6 \\text{ MeV}", "expr2": "T_\\nu = 236 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "235.6 \\text{ MeV}", "expr2": "T_\\mu = 152 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "152.4 \\, \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "T_\\nu = 236 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "152.4 \\, \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "T_\\mu = 152 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "235.6 \\, \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "T_\\nu = 236 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "235.6 \\, \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "T_\\mu = 152 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/4-50", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem about neutral mesons decaying into two gamma rays. The question is asking for the beta (v/c) of the mesons and their rest energy. Let me start by recalling what I know about particle decay and relativistic effects.\n\nFirst, when a particle at rest decays, the products (in this case, two photons) should have equal energy and be emitted in opposite directions to conserve momentum. But here, the photons have different energies—96 MeV forward and 48 MeV backward. That suggests the meson isn't at rest; it's moving. So we need to consider the decay in the meson's rest frame and then transform to the lab frame where the meson is moving.\n\nWait, but how does the direction of the photons relate between the two frames? In the rest frame, the photons would be emitted in opposite directions with equal energy. But when the meson is moving, the Doppler effect comes into play. The forward photon would be blueshifted, and the backward one redshifted. The energies given are in the lab frame, right?\n\nSo maybe I can use the Doppler shift formula for photons. The Doppler factor depends on the velocity of the meson. Let me recall the Doppler formula for light. If a source is moving with speed v relative to the lab frame, then the observed frequency (and hence energy, since E = hν) depends on the angle of emission.\n\nThe Doppler shift formula for a photon emitted at an angle θ' in the rest frame of the source (meson) is given by:\n\nE = E' * sqrt[(1 + β)/(1 - β)] if the photon is emitted in the forward direction (θ' = 0), and\n\nE = E' * sqrt[(1 - β)/(1 + β)] if emitted in the backward direction (θ' = π).\n\nBut wait, in the meson's rest frame, the two photons must be emitted in opposite directions with equal energy. Let's denote the rest energy of the meson as E0, so each photon has energy E' = E0/2 in the rest frame.\n\nBut in the lab frame, where the meson is moving with velocity β, the forward photon (aligned with the meson's motion) will have higher energy, and the backward one lower. The given energies are 96 MeV and 48 MeV. So perhaps the forward photon in the lab frame corresponds to the photon emitted in the forward direction in the meson's rest frame, which gets blueshifted, and the backward one is redshifted.\n\nSo, let's set up equations. Let E1 = 96 MeV (forward) and E2 = 48 MeV (backward). In the rest frame, each photon has energy E' = E0/2.\n\nThen, applying Doppler shift:\n\nE1 = E' * sqrt[(1 + β)/(1 - β)]\n\nE2 = E' * sqrt[(1 - β)/(1 + β)]\n\nBut since E' = E0/2, substituting:\n\nE1 = (E0/2) * sqrt[(1 + β)/(1 - β)]\n\nE2 = (E0/2) * sqrt[(1 - β)/(1 + β)]\n\nNow, if I take the ratio E1/E2, that should eliminate E0. Let's compute that:\n\nE1/E2 = [ (E0/2) * sqrt((1+β)/(1-β)) ] / [ (E0/2) * sqrt((1-β)/(1+β)) ) ]\n\nThe E0/2 cancels out. Then:\n\nE1/E2 = sqrt( (1+β)/(1-β) ) / sqrt( (1-β)/(1+β) ) )\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nsqrt( [(1+β)/(1-β)] / [(1-β)/(1+β)] ) = sqrt( [(1+β)^2 / (1 - β)^2] ) = (1 + β)/(1 - β)\n\nSo E1/E2 = (1 + β)/(1 - β)\n\nGiven E1 = 96, E2 = 48, so E1/E2 = 2. Therefore:\n\n2 = (1 + β)/(1 - β)\n\nSolving for β:\n\n2(1 - β) = 1 + β\n\n2 - 2β = 1 + β\n\n2 - 1 = 3β\n\n1 = 3β => β = 1/3 ≈ 0.333...\n\nSo that's part (a), β = 1/3.\n\nNow part (b), the rest energy E0. From either E1 or E2 equation. Let's use E1:\n\nE1 = (E0/2) * sqrt[(1 + β)/(1 - β)]\n\nWe know β = 1/3. Let's compute sqrt[(1 + 1/3)/(1 - 1/3)] = sqrt[(4/3)/(2/3)] = sqrt(4/3 * 3/2) = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142\n\nSo E1 = (E0/2) * sqrt(2)\n\nTherefore, E0 = 2 * E1 / sqrt(2) = 2 * 96 / 1.4142 ≈ 192 / 1.4142 ≈ 135.7 MeV\n\nAlternatively, using E2:\n\nE2 = (E0/2) * sqrt[(1 - β)/(1 + β)]\n\nsqrt[(1 - 1/3)/(1 + 1/3)] = sqrt[(2/3)/(4/3)] = sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.7071\n\nSo E2 = (E0/2) * 0.7071\n\nThen E0 = 2 * E2 / 0.7071 ≈ 2 * 48 / 0.7071 ≈ 96 / 0.7071 ≈ 135.7 MeV\n\nSo either way, E0 ≈ 135.7 MeV. But the question says \"approximate\" rest energy. Wait, but maybe there's an exact expression. Let's compute it exactly.\n\nFrom E1:\n\nsqrt[(1 + β)/(1 - β)] with β = 1/3:\n\n(1 + 1/3) = 4/3, (1 - 1/3) = 2/3. So ratio is (4/3)/(2/3) = 2. So sqrt(2). Therefore:\n\nE1 = (E0/2) * sqrt(2)\n\nSo E0 = 2 * E1 / sqrt(2) = 2 * 96 / sqrt(2) = 192 / sqrt(2) = 96 * sqrt(2) ≈ 96 * 1.4142 ≈ 135.7 MeV\n\nSimilarly, using E2:\n\nsqrt[(1 - β)/(1 + β)] = sqrt( (2/3)/(4/3) ) = sqrt(1/2) = 1/sqrt(2)\n\nE2 = (E0/2) * (1/sqrt(2)) => E0 = 2 * E2 * sqrt(2) = 2 * 48 * 1.4142 ≈ 96 * 1.4142 ≈ 135.7 MeV\n\nSo exact value is 96 * sqrt(2) MeV. Let me compute that:\n\nsqrt(2) ≈ 1.41421356\n\n96 * 1.41421356 ≈ 96 * 1.4142 ≈ 96 * 1.4 = 134.4, 96 * 0.0142 ≈ 1.3632, total ≈ 135.76 MeV. So approximately 136 MeV. But the problem says \"approximate\", so maybe 136 MeV. But perhaps the exact value is 96*sqrt(2) which is 96*1.4142... but maybe we can write it as 96*sqrt(2) MeV. Wait, but the problem says \"approximate\", so maybe 136 MeV. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to get an exact value without sqrt(2). Wait, let me check the equations again.\n\nWait, when we found β = 1/3, then the gamma factor γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 1/9) = 1/sqrt(8/9) = 3/(2*sqrt(2)) ≈ 1.06066. But maybe that's not directly needed here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rest energy can be found via invariant quantities. The total energy squared minus momentum squared times c squared should be invariant. In the lab frame, the meson's energy is γ E0, and its momentum is γ β E0 / c. Then, the invariant mass squared is (γ E0)^2 - (γ β E0)^2 c² / c² = E0² (γ² - γ² β²) = E0² γ² (1 - β²) = E0² (since γ² (1 - β²) = 1). So that's invariant.\n\nBut the decay products are two photons. The invariant mass squared of the two photons is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since photons have E = pc, the momentum vectors are in opposite directions. Let's assume the forward photon has momentum p1 in the +x direction, and the backward photon has momentum p2 in the -x direction. So total momentum is p1 - p2. But energies are E1 = p1 c, E2 = p2 c.\n\nSo the invariant mass squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2 c². Wait, but units might be tricky. Let me write it properly.\n\nThe invariant mass squared is (sum E)^2 - (sum (p c))^2. For two photons moving in opposite directions, their momenta vectors are opposite. Let's say photon 1 has momentum p1 in +x, photon 2 has p2 in -x. So sum p c = p1 c - p2 c. But since E1 = p1 c and E2 = p2 c, then sum p c = (E1 - E2)/c * c = E1 - E2.\n\nTherefore, invariant mass squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = [ (E1 + E2) + (E1 - E2) ] [ (E1 + E2) - (E1 - E2) ] = (2 E1)(2 E2) = 4 E1 E2.\n\nBut the invariant mass squared should also be equal to (E0)^2, since the meson's rest energy is E0. Therefore:\n\nE0^2 = 4 E1 E2\n\nSo E0 = 2 sqrt(E1 E2)\n\nPlugging in E1 = 96 MeV, E2 = 48 MeV:\n\nE0 = 2 sqrt(96 * 48) = 2 sqrt(4608) = 2 * sqrt(4608)\n\nCompute sqrt(4608):\n\n4608 = 64 * 72 = 64 * 9 * 8 = 64 * 72. So sqrt(64 * 72) = 8 * sqrt(72) = 8 * 6 * sqrt(2) = 48 sqrt(2). Therefore:\n\nE0 = 2 * 48 sqrt(2) = 96 sqrt(2) ≈ 135.7 MeV\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So this gives an exact expression: E0 = 2 sqrt(E1 E2). So in this case, E0 = 2 * sqrt(96 * 48) = 2 * sqrt(4608) = 2 * 48 * sqrt(2) = 96 sqrt(2) MeV. So that's exact. But the problem says \"approximate\", so maybe we need to compute the numerical value. 96 * 1.4142 ≈ 135.7 MeV. So approximately 136 MeV.\n\nBut let me check the calculation again. 96 * 48 = 4608. sqrt(4608) = sqrt(64*72) = 8*sqrt(72) = 8*sqrt(36*2) = 8*6*sqrt(2) = 48 sqrt(2). So 2*48 sqrt(2) = 96 sqrt(2). So yes, exact expression is 96√2 MeV. But maybe the problem expects the approximate value, so 136 MeV. But maybe they want the exact form. Let me see the problem statement again. Part (b) says \"determine the (approximate) rest energy\". So perhaps they accept 96√2 MeV as exact, but approximate would be 136 MeV. But maybe the answer is 144 MeV? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, when I calculated via the Doppler shift, I got E0 = 96 * sqrt(2) ≈ 135.7, but via the invariant mass, same result. So 135.7 is approximately 136. But maybe the problem expects an exact answer in terms of the given numbers. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the invariant mass approach. Wait, the invariant mass of the two photons should equal the rest mass of the meson. So yes, E0^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2. Since p1 = E1 / c and p2 = E2 / c, but directions are opposite. So the total momentum is (E1 - E2)/c. Therefore, the invariant mass squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2. Therefore, E0 = 2 sqrt(E1 E2). So that's a general result. So regardless of the frame, the rest mass is 2 sqrt(E1 E2). Therefore, in this case, E0 = 2 sqrt(96 * 48) = 2 sqrt(4608) = 96 sqrt(2) MeV. So that's exact. But since the problem says \"approximate\", maybe they want the numerical value. So 96 * 1.4142 ≈ 135.7, which is approximately 136 MeV. So the answer is approximately 136 MeV.\n\nBut let me check with the values. If E0 is 96√2, that's approximately 135.76 MeV. So rounding to two significant figures, since the given energies are 96 and 48 (two sig figs each), the answer should be two sig figs: 136 MeV. But 96 has two, 48 has two, so 96*48=4608, which is four digits but leading zeros. Wait, but when multiplying, the number of sig figs is determined by the least number of sig figs in the factors. Both 96 and 48 have two sig figs, so the product should have two. So sqrt(4608) would have two sig figs, so 48 sqrt(2) ≈ 67.88, then 2*67.88 ≈ 135.76, which rounds to 140? Wait, no. Wait, 4608 has four digits but when considering sig figs, 96 (two sig figs) times 48 (two sig figs) is 4600 (two sig figs). So sqrt(4600) is about 67.82, times 2 is 135.64, which rounds to 140 with two sig figs? Wait, no. Wait, 96 and 48 are both two sig figs. So 96 * 48 = 4608, but with two sig figs, that's 4.6 x 10^3. Then sqrt(4.6 x 10^3) = sqrt(4600) ≈ 67.82, times 2 is 135.64, which is approximately 140 if we keep two sig figs. Wait, but 135.64 is 1.3564 x 10^2, which is approximately 1.4 x 10^2 = 140. But that seems like a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the exact expression 96√2 MeV as the answer, and \"approximate\" just refers to not needing to calculate the decimal. But the problem says \"determine the (approximate) rest energy\", so perhaps they want the numerical value. So 96 * 1.4142 ≈ 135.7 MeV, which is approximately 136 MeV. So I think 136 MeV is the answer they expect.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\n(a) β = 1/3\n\n(b) E0 ≈ 136 MeV\n\nBut let me check once more. If the meson is moving with speed β, and in its rest frame emits two photons of energy E0/2 each, then in the lab frame, their energies are Doppler shifted. The ratio of the energies is (1 + β)/(1 - β) = 2, leading to β = 1/3. Then using either E1 or E2 to find E0, we get E0 = 96 * sqrt(2) ≈ 135.7 MeV. Alternatively, via invariant mass, E0 = 2 sqrt(96 * 48) = same result. So yes, that's correct.\n</think>\n\n(a) To determine the velocity parameter $\\beta = v/c$ for the mesons, we use the ratio of the photon energies in the lab frame. The forward photon energy $E_1 = 96$ MeV and backward photon energy $E_2 = 48$ MeV. The ratio $E_1/E_2 = 2$ is related to $\\beta$ by the Doppler shift formula:  \n\\[\n\\frac{E_1}{E_2} = \\frac{1 + \\beta}{1 - \\beta}.\n\\]\nSolving for $\\beta$:  \n\\[\n2 = \\frac{1 + \\beta}{1 - \\beta} \\implies 2(1 - \\beta) = 1 + \\beta \\implies 2 - 2\\beta = 1 + \\beta \\implies \\beta = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\n(b) The rest energy $E_0$ of the meson is determined using the invariant mass relation for the two photons. The invariant mass squared is:  \n\\[\nE_0^2 = 4E_1E_2.\n\\]\nSubstituting $E_1 = 96$ MeV and $E_2 = 48$ MeV:  \n\\[\nE_0 = 2\\sqrt{E_1E_2} = 2\\sqrt{96 \\times 48} = 2\\sqrt{4608} = 96\\sqrt{2} \\, \\text{MeV}.\n\\]\nApproximating $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$, the rest energy is:  \n\\[\nE_0 \\approx 96 \\times 1.414 \\approx 136 \\, \\text{MeV}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answers  \n(a) \\[\n\\boxed{\\beta = \\frac{1}{3}}\n\\]  \n(b) \\[\n\\boxed{136 \\, \\text{MeV}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\beta = \\frac{1}{3}", "136 \\, \\text{MeV}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\beta = \\frac{1}{3}", "expr2": "\\frac{1}{3}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "1/3", "expr2": "1/3"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "136 \\, \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "\\frac{1}{3}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "136 \\, \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "136 \\, \\text{MeV/c}^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.5}
{"id": "atomic/3-47", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many Ar³⁷ atoms are produced per day in this neutrino detector. Hmm, the reaction given is a neutrino interacting with Cl³⁷ to produce Ar³⁷ and an electron. So, the main thing here is to calculate the rate of this reaction happening in the detector. \n\nFirst, I need to know how much Cl³⁷ is present in the detector. The detector has 4×10⁵ liters of CCl₄. Let me convert liters to grams or moles. Wait, tetrachlorethylene is CCl₄, right? So, the molecular formula is C₂Cl₄ actually. Wait, no, wait. Tetrachlorethylene is CCl₂=CCl₂, so the formula is C₂Cl₄. So each molecule has four chlorine atoms. But maybe the problem simplifies it as CCl₄? Wait, maybe the user made a typo, but let me check. Tetrachlorethylene is also known as perchloroethylene, and its formula is C₂Cl₄. So each molecule has four Cl atoms. So, the number of Cl atoms per molecule is 4. \n\nSo, the detector volume is 4×10⁵ liters. Let's convert that to cubic meters first. Since 1 m³ is 1000 liters, so 4×10⁵ liters is 400 m³. Wait, no, 4×10⁵ liters is 400,000 liters, which is 400 cubic meters. But maybe it's easier to work with liters. \n\nThe density of CCl₄ (carbon tetrachloride) is about 1.59 g/cm³, but wait, tetrachlorethylene (C₂Cl₄) has a different density. Let me check. Wait, perchloroethylene (C₂Cl₄) has a density around 1.62 g/cm³ at 20°C. So, approximately 1.62 g/cm³. So, converting liters to cm³: 1 liter is 1000 cm³. So, 4×10⁵ liters is 4×10⁸ cm³. \n\nSo, mass = density × volume = 1.62 g/cm³ × 4×10⁸ cm³ = 6.48×10⁸ grams. Then, convert grams to moles. The molar mass of C₂Cl₄ is (2×12) + (4×35.45) = 24 + 141.8 = 165.8 g/mol. So, moles of C₂Cl₄ = 6.48×10⁸ g / 165.8 g/mol ≈ 3.908×10⁶ mol. \n\nEach mole of C₂Cl₄ has 4 moles of Cl atoms. So total moles of Cl = 4 × 3.908×10⁶ ≈ 1.563×10⁷ mol. Now, assuming that natural chlorine has a certain abundance of Cl³⁷. Wait, chlorine has two main isotopes: Cl³⁵ (about 75.77%) and Cl³⁷ (24.23%). So, the fraction of Cl that is Cl³⁷ is 24.23%, or 0.2423. \n\nTherefore, moles of Cl³⁷ = 1.563×10⁷ mol × 0.2423 ≈ 3.786×10⁶ mol. Then, number of Cl³⁷ atoms = 3.786×10⁶ mol × Avogadro's number (6.022×10²³ atoms/mol) ≈ 2.28×10³⁰ atoms. \n\nNow, the next part is the neutrino flux. Solar neutrinos have a certain flux at Earth's surface. The solar neutrino flux is approximately 7×10¹⁰ neutrinos per square centimeter per second. But wait, this might depend on the neutrino energy and the specific reaction. For the chlorine experiment (like the Homestake experiment), the relevant neutrinos are those from the sun's boron-8 decay, which have higher energy. The flux for boron-8 neutrinos is lower. Let me recall: the boron-8 neutrino flux is about 5×10⁶ cm⁻² s⁻¹. Wait, but maybe I need to check. \n\nWait, the Homestake experiment used Cl³⁷ to detect neutrinos via the reaction ν_e + ³⁷Cl → ³⁷Ar + e⁻. The expected neutrino flux from the sun's boron-8 decay is about 5×10⁶ cm⁻² s⁻¹. But the actual detected rate was about 1/3 of that, leading to the solar neutrino problem. But maybe for this estimation, we can use the theoretical flux. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the solar neutrino flux as a given. Let's proceed. \n\nThe cross-section for the reaction is another factor. The cross-section σ for neutrino capture by Cl³⁷ is very small. For boron-8 neutrinos, the cross-section is roughly 10⁻⁴³ cm² per Cl³⁷ atom. \n\nThe production rate R of Ar³⁷ is given by R = N × Φ × σ, where N is the number of Cl³⁷ atoms, Φ is the neutrino flux, and σ is the cross-section. \n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: N ≈ 2.28×10³⁰ atoms, Φ ≈ 5×10⁶ cm⁻² s⁻¹, σ ≈ 1×10⁻⁴³ cm². \n\nSo R = 2.28×10³⁰ × 5×10⁶ × 1×10⁻⁴³ = 2.28 × 5 × 10^(30+6-43) = 11.4 × 10⁻⁷ = 1.14×10⁻⁶ per second. \n\nConvert that to per day: 1.14×10⁻⁶ s⁻¹ × 86400 s/day ≈ 0.0985 per day. So approximately 0.1 Ar³⁷ atoms produced per day. \n\nBut wait, this seems really low. The Homestake experiment had a much larger detector? Wait, Homestake used 100,000 gallons of C₂Cl₄, which is about 378,000 liters. Wait, the problem here is 4×10⁵ liters, which is 400,000 liters, similar to Homestake. But Homestake detected about 0.5 atoms per day, but their actual capture rate was lower. Wait, maybe my cross-section is off. Let me check. \n\nWait, the cross-section for Cl³⁷ capturing a boron-8 neutrino is actually around 1×10⁻⁴⁵ cm²? If that's the case, then the rate would be even lower. Wait, I need to verify the cross-section. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross-section is about 10⁻⁴³ cm². Let me check some references. For example, the cross-section for the reaction ν_e + ³⁷Cl → ³⁷Ar + e⁻ is energy-dependent. The boron-8 neutrinos have energies up to about 14 MeV. The cross-section for this reaction is approximately 1×10⁻⁴³ cm² for each neutrino. \n\nBut if that's the case, then with N=2.28×10³⁰, Φ=5×10⁶ cm⁻² s⁻¹, σ=1e-43 cm², then R=2.28e30 *5e6 *1e-43 = 1.14e-7 per second. Then per day, 1.14e-7 *86400 ≈ 0.00985 per day. So about 0.01 atoms per day. That seems even lower. \n\nBut Homestake's actual production rate was a few atoms per month, so maybe 0.1 per day. Hmm, perhaps my flux is incorrect. Let me check the solar neutrino flux. \n\nThe total solar neutrino flux at Earth is about 7×10¹⁰ cm⁻² s⁻¹, but most of these are low-energy pp neutrinos. The boron-8 neutrinos have a much lower flux, about 5×10⁶ cm⁻² s⁻¹. The cross-section for Cl³⁷ is only significant for the higher energy neutrinos (like boron-8 and hep), so the relevant flux is 5e6 cm⁻² s⁻¹. \n\nSo with that, the calculation gives about 0.01 atoms per day. But Homestake had a similar volume and detected about 0.5 atoms per day. Wait, maybe my cross-section is wrong. Let me check another source. \n\nAccording to some references, the cross-section for Cl³⁷ for boron-8 neutrinos is approximately 3×10⁻⁴³ cm². If that's the case, then R=2.28e30 *5e6 *3e-43 = 2.28*5*3=34.2; 10^(30+6-43)=10^-7. So 34.2e-7 per second. Then per day: 34.2e-7 *86400 ≈ 34.2 *8.64e-3 ≈ 0.295 per day. So about 0.3 atoms per day. \n\nBut even then, Homestake's expected rate was about 1.5 SNU (Solar Neutrino Units). 1 SNU is 10⁻³⁶ captures per target atom per second. Wait, maybe I should use SNU. \n\nWait, the formula for the event rate is R = N × Φ × σ. But sometimes, the product Φ × σ is given in terms of SNU. 1 SNU = 1e-36 captures per target atom per second. \n\nIf the flux is 5e6 cm⁻² s⁻¹ and cross-section is 1e-43 cm², then Φ × σ = 5e6 *1e-43 =5e-37 per atom per second. Which is 0.5 SNU (since 1 SNU=1e-36). So the rate would be N × 0.5e-36. \n\nWait, N is the number of target atoms. So if N=2.28e30 atoms, then R=2.28e30 *0.5e-36 =1.14e-6 per second. Which is the same as before. So 1.14e-6 per second *86400=0.098 per day. So about 0.1 Ar³⁷ atoms per day. \n\nBut Homestake had about 0.5 atoms per day expected, but observed about 0.3. So maybe the cross-section is higher. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of Cl³⁷ atoms. Let me check the calculations again. \n\nStarting from 4e5 liters of CCl4 (wait, but the actual compound is C₂Cl₄). Let's recalculate the number of Cl atoms. \n\nFirst, volume is 4e5 liters = 4e5 L. Since 1 L = 1000 cm³, so 4e5 L = 4e8 cm³. \n\nDensity of C₂Cl₄ is 1.62 g/cm³, so mass = 1.62 g/cm³ *4e8 cm³ =6.48e8 g. \n\nMolar mass of C₂Cl₄: C is 12.01, Cl is 35.45. So 2*12.01 +4*35.45 =24.02 +141.8=165.82 g/mol. \n\nMoles of C₂Cl₄ =6.48e8 g /165.82 g/mol≈3.908e6 mol. \n\nEach mole of C₂Cl₄ has 4 moles of Cl atoms. So total moles of Cl =4*3.908e6≈1.563e7 mol. \n\nCl³⁷ abundance is 24.23%, so moles of Cl³⁷=1.563e7 *0.2423≈3.786e6 mol. \n\nNumber of Cl³⁷ atoms=3.786e6 mol *6.022e23 atoms/mol≈2.28e30 atoms. \n\nThat seems correct. \n\nSo with Φ=5e6 cm⁻² s⁻¹, σ=1e-43 cm², R=2.28e30 *5e6 *1e-43=1.14e-6 per second. \n\nPer day: 1.14e-6 *86400≈0.0985 per day. So approximately 0.1 atoms per day. \n\nBut Homestake's detector had about 10^30 Cl atoms and expected about 1 atom every few days. Wait, maybe the cross-section is higher. If the cross-section is 3e-43 cm², then R=0.3 per day. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the flux is higher. Let me check the boron-8 neutrino flux. According to standard solar models, the boron-8 neutrino flux is about 5×10⁶ cm⁻² s⁻¹. So that's correct. \n\nSo the calculation leads to about 0.1 Ar³⁷ atoms per day. \n\nBut the problem says \"estimate\", so maybe the answer is approximately 0.1 per day, but maybe the student is supposed to make different assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross-section is taken as 1e-45 cm², leading to even lower rate. But that seems inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the neutrino flux considered is all solar neutrinos, not just boron-8. The total solar neutrino flux is about 7e10 cm⁻² s⁻¹, but most are low-energy pp neutrinos that can't trigger the Cl³⁷ reaction. Only the higher energy ones (boron-8, hep, etc.) contribute. So if we take the total flux of high-energy neutrinos, maybe it's higher. \n\nBut the cross-section for lower energy neutrinos is much smaller. For example, pp neutrinos have energies up to 0.42 MeV, which is below the threshold for Cl³⁷ reaction (the threshold is about 0.814 MeV). So only boron-8 (up to ~14 MeV) and hep (up to ~18 MeV) neutrinos contribute. The hep flux is negligible, so the main contribution is boron-8. \n\nThus, the flux is indeed ~5e6 cm⁻² s⁻¹. \n\nSo the conclusion is about 0.1 Ar³⁷ atoms per day. \n\nBut the problem says \"estimate\", so maybe rounding to ~0.1 per day. \n\nNow, the second part: how to improve the experiment. \n\nPossible improvements: \n\n1. Increase the number of target atoms (more detector volume or higher concentration of Cl³⁷). \n\n2. Use a detector material with a higher cross-section for neutrino interactions. \n\n3. Lower the detection threshold to detect lower energy neutrinos (but Cl³⁷ has a threshold). \n\n4. Reduce background radiation (since the signal is very small, reducing background events is crucial). \n\n5. Use a real-time detector (like liquid scintillators or water Cherenkov detectors) instead of radiochemical methods which require extracting Ar³⁷ periodically. \n\n6. Use a larger target mass or a more abundant target isotope. \n\n7. Improve the efficiency of extracting and counting Ar³⁷ atoms. \n\nSo, possible answers for improvement include using a larger detector, reducing backgrounds, using a different target with a higher cross-section, or real-time detection methods. \n\nAssumptions made in the calculation: \n\n- The density of C₂Cl₄ is 1.62 g/cm³. \n\n- The isotopic abundance of Cl³⁷ is 24.23%. \n\n- The solar neutrino flux (boron-8) is 5×10⁶ cm⁻² s⁻¹. \n\n- The cross-section for the reaction is 1×10⁻⁴³ cm². \n\n- The detector is 100% efficient in capturing the produced Ar³⁷. \n\n- No losses due to decay of Ar³⁷ (which has a half-life of 35 days, so over a day, the decay is negligible). \n\n- All Cl atoms are in the form of Cl³⁷ (but we accounted for the isotopic abundance). \n\nSo, the final answer is approximately 0.1 atoms per day. But since we can't have a fraction of an atom, maybe it's stated as ~0.1 per day. However, given the possible variations in cross-section and flux, the answer could vary. But based on the calculation, it's about 0.1.\n</think>\n\nTo estimate the number of Ar³⁷ atoms produced per day in the detector, we proceed as follows:\n\n**Assumptions:**\n1. **Detector composition:** The detector contains \\(4 \\times 10^5\\) liters of tetrachlorethylene (\\(\\text{C}_2\\text{Cl}_4\\)), with a density of \\(1.62 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3\\).\n2. **Chlorine isotopes:** Natural chlorine has 24.23% \\(\\text{Cl}^{37}\\).\n3. **Neutrino flux:** The solar boron-8 neutrino flux is \\(5 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{cm}^{-2} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}\\).\n4. **Cross-section:** The interaction cross-section for \\(\\nu + \\text{Cl}^{37} \\rightarrow \\text{Ar}^{37} + e^-\\) is \\(1 \\times 10^{-43} \\, \\text{cm}^2\\).\n5. **Efficiency:** Full detection efficiency and no background interference.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1. **Mass of \\(\\text{C}_2\\text{Cl}_4\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mass} = 4 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{L} \\times 1000 \\, \\text{cm}^3/\\text{L} \\times 1.62 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3 = 6.48 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{g}.\n   \\]\n2. **Moles of \\(\\text{C}_2\\text{Cl}_4\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Molar mass of } \\text{C}_2\\text{Cl}_4 = 165.82 \\, \\text{g/mol}, \\quad \\text{Moles} = \\frac{6.48 \\times 10^8}{165.82} \\approx 3.91 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{mol}.\n   \\]\n3. **Total moles of Cl:**\n   \\[\n   4 \\, \\text{Cl atoms per molecule} \\times 3.91 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{mol} = 1.56 \\times 10^7 \\, \\text{mol Cl}.\n   \\]\n4. **Moles of \\(\\text{Cl}^{37}\\):**\n   \\[\n   1.56 \\times 10^7 \\, \\text{mol} \\times 0.2423 \\approx 3.79 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{mol}.\n   \\]\n5. **Number of \\(\\text{Cl}^{37}\\) atoms:**\n   \\[\n   3.79 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{mol} \\times 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\, \\text{atoms/mol} \\approx 2.28 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\text{atoms}.\n   \\]\n6. **Production rate (\\(R\\)):**\n   \\[\n   R = N \\Phi \\sigma = (2.28 \\times 10^{30}) \\times (5 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{cm}^{-2} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (1 \\times 10^{-43} \\, \\text{cm}^2) = 1.14 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}.\n   \\]\n7. **Atoms per day:**\n   \\[\n   1.14 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\times 86400 \\, \\text{s/day} \\approx 0.0985 \\, \\text{atoms/day}.\n   \\]\n\n**Improvements to the experiment:**\n1. **Increase target mass** to enhance interaction probability.\n2. **Use a real-time detector** (e.g., liquid scintillator) instead of radiochemical methods.\n3. **Reduce background noise** (e.g., shielding, purification).\n4. **Optimize cross-section** by using a target isotope with higher neutrino interaction probability.\n5. **Improve extraction efficiency** for \\(\\text{Ar}^{37}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.1 \\, \\text{atoms per day}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["0.1 \\, \\text{atoms per day}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "0.1 \\, \\text{atoms per day}", "expr2": "480"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/3-49", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to answer part (a) and (b) about parity nonconservation in the given decay processes. Let me start by recalling what parity conservation means. Parity is a symmetry property where if you invert the spatial coordinates, the physical laws remain the same. But in weak interactions, parity is not conserved, which was famously demonstrated by the Wu experiment with beta decay of Cobalt-60. \n\nThe question here is about pion and muon decays. The pion decay is π+ → μ+ + ν_μ, and then the muon decays into e+ + ν_e + anti-ν_μ. Both of these are weak interactions, right? Because pions decay via the weak force, and muons also decay via the weak force. \n\nFor part (a), the observable quantity that shows parity nonconservation. In parity violation, certain asymmetries are observed. In the case of beta decay, the electrons were emitted preferentially in a direction opposite to the orientation of the nuclear spin, which showed a asymmetry. For the muon decay, maybe the angular distribution of the emitted positrons is not symmetric. Wait, but the pion decay first. The pion is a spin-0 particle, so when it decays into muon and neutrino, the muon is a spin-1/2 particle. The neutrino is also spin-1/2. So in the pion decay, the muon and neutrino would have their spins aligned. But how does parity violation manifest here?\n\nWait, in the decay of the pion, since the pion has spin 0, the muon and neutrino must be emitted with opposite spins to conserve angular momentum. But neutrinos are left-handed in the Standard Model, meaning their spin is opposite to their momentum direction (negative helicity). So the muon, being a charged lepton, would have its spin direction related to the neutrino's. But since the pion is spinless, the decay products must have their spins opposite. So the muon would have its spin in the same direction as its momentum? Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The pion at rest decays into a muon and a neutrino. The total angular momentum must be zero. So the muon and neutrino must have their spins opposite. But the neutrino is left-handed, so its spin is opposite to its momentum. Therefore, the muon's spin must be aligned with its momentum? Because if the neutrino's spin is opposite to its momentum, then the muon's spin would have to be in the same direction as its own momentum to cancel out. So the muon would be polarized in the direction of its motion. That polarization could be observed in the subsequent decay of the muon. \n\nAh, right! The muon from pion decay is polarized. Then, when the muon decays into a positron and neutrinos, the angular distribution of the positron would depend on the muon's polarization. If parity were conserved, the distribution would be symmetric, but because parity is violated, there's an asymmetry. The observable is the angular distribution of the decay products relative to the spin direction of the parent particle. \n\nIn the case of the muon decay, the positrons are emitted preferentially in the direction opposite to the muon's spin. The distribution would be something like 1 + a cosθ, where θ is the angle between the positron's momentum and the muon's spin direction. The coefficient 'a' would be non-zero if there's parity violation. For maximum parity violation, like in the V-A theory, the asymmetry would be maximum. So the formula for the distribution might be dN/dΩ proportional to 1 - cosθ, or 1 + cosθ, depending on the convention. Wait, in the original Wu experiment, the distribution was 1 + v cosθ, where v is the velocity, but here for muon decay, maybe it's similar. \n\nAlternatively, the muon decay is μ+ → e+ + ν_e + anti-ν_μ. The positron's energy and angle would be correlated with the muon's spin. The parity violation would lead to an asymmetry in the angle between the positron's momentum and the muon's spin direction. The observable is the asymmetry parameter, which can be measured by the angular distribution. So the formula would be something like the decay rate depending on the angle between the positron's direction and the muon's spin. For example, the distribution could be proportional to 1 + α cosθ, where α is a parameter that would be zero if parity is conserved. But since parity is not conserved, α is non-zero. \n\nSo for part (a), the observable is the angular distribution of the decay products (specifically the positron from the muon decay) with respect to the parent particle's spin direction. The formula would be something like dΓ/dcosθ ∝ 1 + A cosθ, where A is the asymmetry parameter. The distribution is not isotropic, showing a forward-backward asymmetry. \n\nFor part (b), the question is whether both decays violate parity or only one. The pion decay is π+ → μ+ + ν_μ. Since the pion is a pseudoscalar meson (spin 0, negative parity), and the decay products are a muon (spin 1/2, parity depends on orbital angular momentum) and a neutrino. But in the decay, the pion's parity is intrinsic. The key here is that the decay process is via the weak interaction, which violates parity. The pion decay itself must involve parity violation. However, how is that observed? The pion decay produces a polarized muon, as discussed earlier. The polarization of the muon is a result of parity violation in the pion decay. Then, when the muon decays, the asymmetry in the positron's angular distribution is another evidence of parity violation. \n\nBut does the pion decay process itself show parity violation? Let me think. If the pion decay were parity-conserving, the muon would not be polarized. Because parity conservation would require that the decay products have symmetric angular distributions. But since the muon is polarized, that's a sign of parity violation in the pion decay. Then, the muon's decay also shows parity violation through the angular distribution of the positron. So both decays involve parity violation. But wait, the pion decay is a weak process, and the muon decay is also a weak process. Since weak interactions violate parity, both decays should exhibit parity violation. However, the question is about the evidence shown in the given decay sequence. The observable in part (a) is from the muon decay, but the muon's polarization comes from the pion decay. So the pion decay's parity violation leads to a polarized muon, and the muon decay's parity violation leads to the asymmetric emission of the positron. Therefore, both processes are needed to show the effect, but does each process individually violate parity? \n\nAlternatively, maybe only the muon decay shows parity violation. Wait, but the pion decay must also violate parity. For example, the pion is a pseudoscalar meson, and if parity were conserved, certain decay modes would be forbidden. The pion decay into a muon and neutrino is allowed because parity is violated. Wait, but the pion can decay via the weak interaction regardless of parity. The parity violation in the decay would manifest in the helicity of the neutrino. Since neutrinos are left-handed, the pion decay would produce a left-handed neutrino, which is a parity-violating effect. But how is that observed? The polarization of the muon is a result of the neutrino's helicity. So the pion decay's parity violation is responsible for the muon's polarization. Then, the muon decay's parity violation is responsible for the angular asymmetry of the positron. Therefore, both decays involve parity violation, and the combined sequence allows the measurement of the asymmetry. \n\nSo for part (b), both decay processes violate parity conservation. The pion decay violates parity by producing a polarized muon (due to the helicity of the neutrino), and the muon decay violates parity by having an asymmetric angular distribution of the positron. Therefore, both processes individually violate parity. \n\nBut wait, another angle: maybe the pion decay is a parity-conserving process. Wait, pions have negative parity. If the decay conserved parity, the final state should have parity equal to the pion's parity. The parity of the muon and neutrino system: the muon is a Dirac fermion, which has intrinsic parity +1 (for the particle). The neutrino is a left-handed particle, which has a negative helicity. But parity transformation would flip the momentum and spin, so a left-handed neutrino would become right-handed, which doesn't exist. Therefore, the decay cannot conserve parity because the final state has a left-handed neutrino, which is not parity-invariant. Therefore, the pion decay itself violates parity. \n\nSo both the pion decay and the muon decay are weak processes that violate parity. Therefore, the answer to part (b) is that both decay processes violate parity conservation. \n\nBut the question says \"shows evidence of parity nonconservation.\" The observable in part (a) is from the muon decay, but the muon's polarization comes from the pion decay. So the combined process allows the observation. However, each decay individually violates parity. \n\nAlternatively, maybe only the muon decay violates parity. Wait, but the pion decay is a weak interaction process, which is known to violate parity. The pion's decay into a muon and neutrino is a parity-violating process because the neutrino is left-handed. The pion being spin-0, the decay products must have their spins opposite. The neutrino is left-handed, so the muon must be polarized. The pion decay's parity violation is in the helicity of the neutrino and the polarization of the muon. Then, the muon decay's parity violation is in the angular distribution of the positron. \n\nTherefore, both decays involve parity violation. So the answer to (b) is that both processes violate parity conservation. \n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me check some references in my mind. The classic example of parity violation in pion decay is that if parity were conserved, the pion could decay into both left-handed and right-handed neutrinos, but since the weak interaction only produces left-handed neutrinos, the decay violates parity. Similarly, the muon decay produces an asymmetry in the electron/positron distribution. So both decays are weak processes and thus violate parity. Therefore, the answer to (b) is that both decay processes violate parity conservation. \n\nBut the question says \"does the process show that both decay processes violate parity conservation, or only one?\" The process here refers to the entire sequence. The observable in (a) is from the muon decay, but the muon's polarization comes from the pion decay. So the observation of the asymmetry in the positron's direction requires both the pion decay (to produce a polarized muon) and the muon decay (to have the asymmetry). Therefore, the combined observation shows that both decays must violate parity. Because if the pion decay conserved parity, the muon wouldn't be polarized, and there would be no asymmetry in the muon decay. If the muon decay conserved parity, even if the muon were polarized, the decay products would be symmetric. Therefore, the observed asymmetry requires both parity violation in the pion decay (to polarize the muon) and in the muon decay (to have the angular dependence). Hence, both processes violate parity. \n\nSo part (b) answer is that both decay processes violate parity conservation. The reasoning is that the pion decay produces a polarized muon (parity violation in pion decay), and the muon decay's angular distribution (parity violation in muon decay) shows the asymmetry. Therefore, both are needed for the observable effect, implying both violate parity.\n</think>\n\n(a) The observable quantity measured to show parity nonconservation is the **angular distribution of the positron** (\\(e^+\\)) emitted in the muon decay (\\(\\mu^+ \\to e^+ + \\nu_e + \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu\\)). The distribution depends on the angle \\(\\theta\\) between the positron's momentum and the muon's spin direction. The formula for this distribution is:  \n\\[\n\\frac{d\\Gamma}{d\\cos\\theta} \\propto 1 + A\\cos\\theta,\n\\]  \nwhere \\(A\\) is the asymmetry parameter. A non-zero \\(A\\) (e.g., \\(A = -1/3\\) in the Standard Model) indicates parity violation. The distribution is not isotropic, showing a forward-backward asymmetry.\n\n(b) **Both decay processes violate parity conservation.**  \n- **Pion decay (\\(\\pi^+ \\to \\mu^+ + \\nu_\\mu\\)):** The pion is a pseudoscalar meson (negative intrinsic parity). The decay produces a left-handed neutrino (\\(\\nu_\\mu\\)), which violates parity because weak interactions only couple to left-handed particles. This results in a polarized muon (\\(\\mu^+\\)) with its spin aligned opposite to the neutrino’s momentum.  \n- **Muon decay (\\(\\mu^+ \\to e^+ + \\nu_e + \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu\\)):** The angular asymmetry of the positron (\\(e^+\\)) relative to the muon’s spin direction directly demonstrates parity violation. If parity were conserved, the distribution would be symmetric (\\(A = 0\\)), but the observed asymmetry confirms parity nonconservation.  \n\nThe combined sequence requires parity violation in both decays: the pion decay produces a polarized muon, and the muon decay exhibits the angular asymmetry.  \n\nFinal answers:  \n(a) \\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Angular distribution of } e^+ \\text{ with asymmetry parameter } A \\neq 0}\n\\]  \n(b) \\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Both decay processes violate parity conservation.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Angular distribution of } e^+ \\text{ with asymmetry parameter } A \\neq 0", "\\text{Both decay processes violate parity conservation.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Angular distribution of } e^+ \\text{ with asymmetry parameter } A \\neq 0", "expr2": "\\frac{dN}{d\\Omega} = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} \\cos \\theta"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Angular distribution of } e^+ \\text{ with asymmetry parameter } A \\neq 0", "expr2": "\\text{Both decay processes violate parity conservation.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Both decay processes violate parity conservation.}", "expr2": "\\frac{dN}{d\\Omega} = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} \\cos \\theta"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Both decay processes violate parity conservation.}", "expr2": "\\text{Both decay processes violate parity conservation.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.5}
{"id": "atomic/3-25", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these physics problems. First, I need to check which of the given reactions are allowed. For each reaction, I should verify the conservation laws: charge, baryon number, strangeness, and maybe other quantum numbers if necessary. Then, for the second part, the ratio of cross sections between two similar reactions. Let's start with part (a).\n\n**Problem (a): π⁻ + p → K⁻ + Σ⁺**\n\nFirst, check charge conservation. The left side has π⁻ (-1) and proton (+1), so total charge is 0. On the right, K⁻ (-1) and Σ⁺ (+1), total charge is 0. So charge is conserved.\n\nNext, baryon number. π⁻ is a meson (baryon number 0), proton is baryon (+1). So left side total baryon number is +1. On the right, K⁻ is a meson (0), Σ⁺ is a baryon (+1). So baryon number is conserved here.\n\nNow, strangeness. π⁻ has strangeness 0. Proton also 0. So left side total strangeness 0. On the right, K⁻ has strangeness -1 (since K⁺ is +1, so K⁻ is -1), and Σ⁺ has strangeness -1 (I think Σ particles have S=-1). So total strangeness on the right is -1 + (-1) = -2. Wait, that's a problem. Left side strangeness 0, right side -2. So strangeness isn't conserved. But in strong interactions, strangeness is not conserved. However, if this reaction is via the strong interaction, then it's allowed. But wait, the problem doesn't specify the interaction type. Wait, but particles involved: π and proton can interact via strong. But K and Σ are strange particles. So maybe this is a weak interaction? Wait, but the reaction would need to conserve strangeness if it's strong. Since here strangeness changes from 0 to -2, which is a change of 2. So in a strong interaction, strangeness must be conserved. Therefore, this reaction is forbidden by strangeness conservation in the strong interaction. But wait, maybe it's a weak interaction? But weak interactions can change strangeness. However, the cross-section would be much smaller. But the question is whether the reaction is allowed. If the reaction is via the strong interaction, then it's forbidden. But if via weak, allowed. But typically, such reactions are considered under strong or electromagnetic unless specified. Since the particles are hadrons, probably considering strong interaction. Therefore, reaction (a) is forbidden due to strangeness non-conservation.\n\nWait, but wait: the initial particles are π⁻ (non-strange) and proton (non-strange). The products are K⁻ (strange) and Σ⁺ (strange). So the total strangeness on the left is 0, on the right is (-1 for K⁻) + (-1 for Σ⁺) = -2. So ΔS = -2. Since in strong interactions, ΔS = 0, this reaction cannot proceed via strong. But maybe via some other interaction? For example, if it's a weak interaction, then it's allowed, but weak interactions are slow. However, the problem is asking if the reaction is allowed, not the likelihood. But in particle physics, reactions are allowed if they conserve the necessary quantum numbers for the interaction mediating them. Since the problem doesn't specify the interaction, perhaps we need to assume the dominant interaction. But given that the particles are hadrons, perhaps strong interaction is considered. Therefore, reaction (a) is forbidden because strangeness is not conserved, and the reaction would require a change in strangeness which isn't allowed in strong interactions.\n\n**Problem (b): d + d → ⁴He + π⁰**\n\nCheck conservation laws. Let's start with charge. Deuteron (d) has charge +1 each. So two deuterons: total charge +2. On the right, ⁴He has charge +2, π⁰ is neutral. So total charge +2. Charge conserved.\n\nBaryon number: each deuteron has baryon number 1 (since it's a nucleus of 1 proton and 1 neutron). So two deuterons: baryon number 2. ⁴He has baryon number 4 (since it's two protons and two neutrons), but wait, no: wait, the nucleus ⁴He has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, so baryon number 4? Wait, no. Each proton and neutron is baryon number 1. So ⁴He has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, so total baryon number 4? Wait, but the deuteron is a nucleus with baryon number 2 (1 proton + 1 neutron). Wait, no: the deuteron is a nucleus with one proton and one neutron, so baryon number 2? Wait, no. Wait, the baryon number is the number of nucleons. So each deuteron (d) has baryon number 2 (since it's a nucleus of 2 nucleons). So two deuterons: 2 + 2 = 4. On the right, ⁴He has 4 nucleons (baryon number 4), and π⁰ is a meson (baryon number 0). So total baryon number 4. Conserved.\n\nLepton numbers: not involved here, since no leptons.\n\nNow, check other quantum numbers. Strangeness, charm, etc.: all zero here. So no issue.\n\nBut wait, what about the pion production? Pions are mesons, created via strong interactions. However, the reaction is d + d → ⁴He + π⁰. Let's think about the possibility. The deuteron is a nucleus, so this is a nuclear reaction. The product is helium-4 and a pion. Pions can be produced in nuclear reactions if there's enough energy. But we need to check conservation laws. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering that the reaction must conserve isospin? But perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, think about the possible interactions. For pion production, the strong interaction is responsible. But let's check the energy. However, the problem doesn't mention energy, so perhaps we can assume sufficient energy is available. But the question is about whether it's allowed, not energetically possible. So assuming energy is sufficient.\n\nBut another thing: the reaction involves two deuterons fusing into helium-4 and a pion. Let's check the baryon numbers again. Wait, each deuteron has baryon number 2 (since each is a nucleus of 2 nucleons). So two deuterons: 2*2=4. Helium-4 has 4 nucleons, so baryon number 4. The pion has 0. So baryon number is conserved. Charge is conserved. So maybe allowed. But wait, is there any other conservation law that might forbid it?\n\nWait, the reaction is d + d → ⁴He + π⁰. Let's think about the quark content. Deuteron is made of protons and neutrons. ⁴He is two protons and two neutrons. The pion is a quark-antiquark pair. So maybe possible via strong interaction. But let's check spin or angular momentum. However, without specific details on angular momentum, perhaps it's allowed. Alternatively, maybe there's an issue with the conservation of something else. Let me think about the possible interactions. Since the pion is a meson, maybe the reaction is allowed via the strong force. So perhaps reaction (b) is allowed.\n\nWait, but wait: the initial state has two deuterons (each spin 1), so total spin could be 0, 1, or 2. The final state has ⁴He (spin 0) and π⁰ (spin 0). So total spin 0. So angular momentum could be conserved if the initial spins are in a state that allows for total spin 0. So possible. So maybe allowed. So reaction (b) is allowed.\n\n**Problem (c): K⁻ + p → Ξ⁻ + K⁺**\n\nCheck charge: K⁻ (-1) + p (+1) → total 0. On the right, Ξ⁻ (-1) + K⁺ (+1) → total 0. Charge conserved.\n\nBaryon number: K⁻ is a meson (0), proton is 1. Left total 1. Right: Ξ⁻ is a baryon (1), K⁺ is meson (0). Total 1. Conserved.\n\nStrangeness: K⁻ has S = -1 (since K⁺ is S=+1). Proton S=0. Left total S = -1. On the right, Ξ⁻ has S = -2 (I think Ξ particles have S=-2), and K⁺ has S=+1. So total S = -2 +1 = -1. So strangeness is conserved here. Wait, left side S=-1, right side S=-1. So strangeness is conserved. So if this is a strong interaction, then allowed. But wait, the Ξ⁻ is a doubly strange particle. Let me confirm the strangeness values. K⁻: S=-1. Proton: S=0. So total S=-1. Ξ⁻: S=-2. K⁺: S=+1. So total S=-2 +1 = -1. So yes, conserved. Therefore, strangeness is conserved. So if this is a strong interaction, then allowed. But wait, the reaction involves a proton and a K⁻ (which is a strange meson) producing a Ξ⁻ (which has S=-2) and a K⁺ (S=+1). So the strangeness is conserved. Therefore, this reaction is allowed via the strong interaction. Wait, but wait, the Ξ⁻ has S=-2. So the change in strangeness for each particle: K⁻ (S=-1) to K⁺ (S=+1) is a change of +2. The proton (S=0) to Ξ⁻ (S=-2) is a change of -2. So overall, the total strangeness is conserved. Therefore, this reaction is allowed. So reaction (c) is allowed.\n\nWait, but are there any other conservation laws? For example, baryon number, which we checked. Charge is okay. What about other quantum numbers like charm, bottomness, etc.? Not involved here. What about lepton numbers? No leptons involved. So yes, reaction (c) is allowed.\n\nNow, the second part: the ratio of cross sections σ(pp → π⁺d)/σ(np → π⁰d) at the same CM energy.\n\nThis is a classic problem involving isospin symmetry. The idea is that the cross sections for processes related by isospin symmetry should be in the ratio determined by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients involved in the isospin coupling.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the two reactions:\n\n1. p + p → π⁺ + d\n2. n + p → π⁰ + d\n\nWe need to find the ratio σ1/σ2.\n\nIn isospin formalism, the deuteron (d) is an isosinglet (I=0), because it's a bound state of a proton and neutron (which form an I=0 state). The pion has isospin I=1: π⁺ (I3=+1), π⁰ (I3=0), π⁻ (I3=-1). The nucleons (p and n) form an isospin doublet (I=1/2), with p having I3=+1/2 and n I3=-1/2.\n\nFor the reaction p + p → π⁺ + d:\n\nThe initial state is two protons. Each proton has I=1/2, I3=+1/2. Combining two I=1/2 states: possible total I=1 or I=0. But two protons (each I3=+1/2) can only form a state with I3=1. So the total isospin must be I=1, since I3=1 can't come from I=0. Therefore, the initial state has I=1, I3=1.\n\nThe final state is π⁺ (I=1, I3=+1) and deuteron (I=0). So the total isospin of the final state is I=1 (since deuteron is I=0 and pion is I=1). Therefore, the isospin transition is from initial I=1 to final I=1. The amplitude is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling the initial state to the final state.\n\nSimilarly, for the reaction n + p → π⁰ + d:\n\nThe initial state is a neutron (I3=-1/2) and proton (I3=+1/2). The total I3=0. The possible total isospin here can be I=1 or I=0. But since the deuteron is I=0, the final state is π⁰ (I=1, I3=0) + d (I=0), so total isospin I=1, I3=0. Therefore, the initial state must have I=1, I3=0 to match the final state's I=1, I3=0.\n\nThe amplitude for each process depends on the isospin coupling. The cross-section is proportional to the square of the amplitude. So the ratio of cross sections will be the square of the ratio of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the initial states to reach the appropriate I and I3.\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nFor the first reaction (pp → π⁺d):\n\nInitial state: two protons. Each proton is I=1/2, I3=+1/2. The combined state must have I=1, I3=1. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining two I=1/2 states with I3=1/2 each to get I=1, I3=1 is 1 (since |1,1> = |1/2,1/2> |1/2,1/2>).\n\nFinal state: π⁺ (I=1, I3=+1) and d (I=0). The total isospin is I=1, I3=+1. The amplitude is proportional to the overlap between the initial I=1, I3=1 state and the final I=1, I3=1 state. Since the final state is a product of π⁺ (I=1, I3=+1) and d (I=0), the isospin part is just the π⁺ state. So the amplitude is proportional to 1 (since the initial and final I and I3 match).\n\nFor the second reaction (np → π⁰d):\n\nInitial state: neutron (I3=-1/2) and proton (I3=+1/2). The combined state can be I=1, I3=0 or I=0, I3=0. But the final state has I=1 (from π⁰) and d (I=0), so total I=1. Therefore, the initial state must be in the I=1, I3=0 state. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining neutron (I3=-1/2) and proton (I3=+1/2) into I=1, I3=0 is sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(2). Wait, the CG coefficient for |1,0> from |1/2, +1/2> and |1/2, -1/2> is sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(2). Wait, the CG coefficients for combining two spin-1/2 particles:\n\nThe state |I=1, I3=0> is (|p>|n> + |n>|p>)/sqrt(2), but in terms of CG coefficients, the coefficient is sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(2). Wait, actually, the CG coefficient for combining |1/2, +1/2> and |1/2, -1/2> into |1,0> is sqrt(1/2). Because the formula is:\n\n|I=1, I3=0> = (|+1/2> |−1/2> + |−1/2> |+1/2>)/sqrt(2)\n\nSo the amplitude is 1/sqrt(2).\n\nBut the amplitude for the process would then depend on this initial state. Assuming that the transition amplitude is the same for both processes (since the isospin structure is similar), the ratio of cross sections would be the square of the ratio of the CG coefficients for the initial states.\n\nIn the first reaction, the initial state is pure I=1, I3=1, so the CG coefficient is 1. In the second reaction, the initial state (np in I=1, I3=0) has a CG coefficient of 1/sqrt(2). However, the cross-section is proportional to the square of the amplitude, which includes the CG coefficients.\n\nBut wait, the cross-section ratio would be [ (amplitude1)^2 / (amplitude2)^2 ].\n\nAssuming that the matrix elements for the transitions are the same (since the processes are related by isospin symmetry), the ratio of cross sections would be [ (CG_initial1 * CG_final1 )^2 ] / [ (CG_initial2 * CG_final2 )^2 ].\n\nBut in both cases, the final state is I=1, so the CG_final would be 1 for both, since the pion has the correct I3. For the first reaction, the final state is I=1, I3=+1, and the initial state is I=1, I3=+1. The amplitude is proportional to the overlap, which is 1. For the second reaction, the final state is I=1, I3=0, and the initial state is I=1, I3=0. The amplitude is also proportional to 1 (since the initial and final I and I3 match). However, the initial state for the second reaction (np) has a CG coefficient of 1/sqrt(2) to be in the I=1, I3=0 state, whereas the initial state for the first reaction (pp) is already in the I=1, I3=1 state with CG coefficient 1.\n\nBut wait, the initial state for pp is necessarily in I=1, I3=1, so the amplitude is 1. For np, the initial state can be in I=1 or I=0. But since the final state is I=1, only the I=1 component contributes. The probability amplitude for the initial np state to be in the I=1, I3=0 state is 1/sqrt(2). Therefore, the amplitude for the second process is proportional to 1/sqrt(2), so the cross-section is proportional to (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the ratio σ(pp→π⁺d)/σ(np→π⁰d) is (1^2)/( (1/sqrt(2))^2 ) = 1 / (1/2) = 2. So the ratio is 2:1. Therefore, the answer is 2.\n\nBut wait, I need to confirm this. Another approach: the cross-section is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which includes the isospin factors. Assuming that the dynamics (non-isospin factors) are the same for both reactions (same energy, similar interactions), the ratio is determined by the isospin Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nFor the pp → π⁺d reaction:\n\nThe initial state has I=1, I3=1. The final state has π⁺ (I=1, I3=1) and d (I=0). The isospin transition is from I=1 to I=1. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the initial state is 1 (since it's already in I=1, I3=1). The final state is a product of the pion's I=1, I3=1 and the deuteron's I=0. The overlap is 1.\n\nFor the np → π⁰d reaction:\n\nThe initial state must be in the I=1, I3=0 state. The probability amplitude for the np state to be in I=1, I3=0 is 1/sqrt(2) (since the two nucleons can form I=1 and I=0 states). The final state is π⁰ (I=1, I3=0) and d (I=0), so the overlap is 1. Therefore, the amplitude is proportional to 1/sqrt(2), leading to a cross-section proportional to 1/2.\n\nThus, the ratio σ(pp)/σ(np) is (1)/(1/2) = 2. So the ratio is 2. Therefore, the answer is 2, so boxed as \\boxed{2}.\n</think>\n\n**Reactions Analysis:**\n\n**(a) $\\pi^- + p \\rightarrow K^- + \\Sigma^+$**  \n- **Charge:** Conserved (0 → 0).  \n- **Baryon number:** Conserved (1 → 1).  \n- **Strangeness:** Left side: $0$; Right side: $-1$ (K⁻) + $-1$ (Σ⁺) = $-2$.  \n- **Verdict:** **Forbidden** (strangeness not conserved in strong interaction).\n\n**(b) $d + d \\rightarrow ^4\\text{He} + \\pi^0$**  \n- **Charge:** Conserved (+2 → +2).  \n- **Baryon number:** Conserved (4 → 4).  \n- **Other quantum numbers:** No violations.  \n- **Verdict:** **Allowed**.\n\n**(c) $K^- + p \\rightarrow \\Xi^- + K^+$**  \n- **Charge:** Conserved (0 → 0).  \n- **Baryon number:** Conserved (1 → 1).  \n- **Strangeness:** Left side: $-1$; Right side: $-2$ (Ξ⁻) + $+1$ (K⁺) = $-1$.  \n- **Verdict:** **Allowed** (strangeness conserved in strong interaction).\n\n---\n\n**Cross-Section Ratio:**  \nUsing isospin symmetry, the ratio of cross sections $\\sigma(p + p \\rightarrow \\pi^+ + d)/\\sigma(n + p \\rightarrow \\pi^0 + d)$ is determined by the square of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:  \n- For $pp \\rightarrow \\pi^+ d$, the initial state is pure $I=1$, with coefficient $1$.  \n- For $np \\rightarrow \\pi^0 d$, the initial state has a $1/\\sqrt{2}$ probability to be in $I=1$.  \n- **Ratio:** $\\left(\\frac{1}{1/\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = 2$.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nAllowed reactions: **(b)** and **(c)**.

{"id": "atomic/4-32", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The problem is asking for the threshold kinetic energy T of the incident proton in the lab frame for the reaction p + p → π⁺ + D. Threshold energy means the minimum energy needed for the reaction to occur. At threshold, the products (π⁺ and D) are produced at rest in the center-of-mass (CM) frame. That's because if they had any kinetic energy, the initial kinetic energy could be lower and the reaction would still proceed. So, all the energy goes into the rest masses of the products.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for threshold energy in a reaction where a projectile hits a stationary target. The general formula for the threshold kinetic energy is given by:\n\nT = [(sum of rest masses of products)² - (sum of rest masses of reactants)²]/(2 * mass of target)\n\nBut let me verify this. In the lab frame, the target proton is at rest. The incident proton has kinetic energy T and rest mass m_p. The total energy in the lab frame is the sum of the kinetic energy of the incident proton plus its rest energy, plus the rest energy of the target proton. So total energy is (T + m_p c²) + m_p c² = T + 2 m_p c². The total momentum is the momentum of the incident proton, since the target is at rest.\n\nAt threshold, the products (π⁺ and D) are produced at rest in the CM frame. Therefore, in the CM frame, the total energy is just the sum of their rest energies: (m_π + m_D)c². The total momentum in the CM frame is zero.\n\nTo relate the lab frame and CM frame, we can use conservation of energy and momentum. The total energy squared minus (pc c)² should be invariant. So:\n\n(E_lab)^2 - (p_lab c)^2 = (E_cm)^2\n\nWhere E_lab is the total energy in the lab frame, p_lab is the total momentum in the lab frame, and E_cm is the total energy in the CM frame.\n\nSo let's compute E_lab and p_lab.\n\nE_lab = T + 2 m_p c² (since the incident proton has energy T + m_p c², and the target is m_p c²)\n\nBut wait, actually, the incident proton's total energy is K + m_p c², where K is the kinetic energy. But the problem states T is the kinetic energy, so E_lab = (m_p c² + T) + m_p c² = 2 m_p c² + T.\n\nThe momentum of the incident proton, p_lab, can be found from the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n\nE_incident² = (p_lab c)^2 + (m_p c²)^2\n\nSo (m_p c² + T)^2 = (p_lab c)^2 + (m_p c²)^2\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n(m_p c²)^2 + 2 m_p c² T + T² = (p_lab c)^2 + (m_p c²)^2\n\nSubtract (m_p c²)^2 from both sides:\n\n2 m_p c² T + T² = (p_lab c)^2\n\nSo p_lab = sqrt(2 m_p T + T²/c²)/c\n\nBut maybe it's better to keep it symbolic for now.\n\nNow, the invariant quantity is E_lab² - (p_lab c)^2 = (E_cm)^2\n\nE_cm is the total energy in the CM frame, which at threshold is (m_π + m_D)c².\n\nTherefore:\n\n(2 m_p c² + T)^2 - (p_lab c)^2 = (m_π + m_D)^2 c^4\n\nBut we can substitute (p_lab c)^2 from the earlier equation:\n\n(p_lab c)^2 = (m_p c² + T)^2 - (m_p c²)^2 = 2 m_p c² T + T²\n\nWait, but E_lab is (m_p c² + T) + m_p c² = 2 m_p c² + T. Wait, no, the incident proton's energy is K + m_p c², where K is the kinetic energy. So E_lab = (m_p c² + T) + m_p c² = 2 m_p c² + T. Wait, but T is the kinetic energy, so E_lab is (m_p c² + T) + m_p c² = 2 m_p c² + T. But then the momentum p_lab is sqrt( (E_incident/c)^2 - (m_p c)^2 ) = sqrt( ( (m_p c² + T)/c )² - (m_p c)^2 )\n\n= sqrt( (m_p c + T/c )² - m_p² c² )\n\nWait, maybe better to compute (E_lab)^2 - (p_lab c)^2.\n\nE_lab = (m_p c² + T) + m_p c² = 2 m_p c² + T\n\nWait, but actually, the target proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The incident proton has energy E = K + m_p c² = T + m_p c². So total energy in lab is E_lab = T + m_p c² + m_p c² = T + 2 m_p c².\n\nTotal momentum in lab is p_lab = p_incident, which is sqrt( (E_incident/c)^2 - (m_p c)^2 )\n\nE_incident = T + m_p c², so p_incident c = sqrt( (T + m_p c²)^2 - (m_p c²)^2 )\n\n= sqrt( T² + 2 T m_p c² + m_p² c^4 - m_p² c^4 )\n\n= sqrt( T² + 2 T m_p c² )\n\nSo p_lab c = sqrt( T² + 2 T m_p c² )\n\nTherefore, the invariant is:\n\n(E_lab)^2 - (p_lab c)^2 = (T + 2 m_p c²)^2 - (T² + 2 T m_p c² )\n\nExpanding (T + 2 m_p c²)^2:\n\n= T² + 4 T m_p c² + 4 m_p² c^4\n\nSubtract (T² + 2 T m_p c²):\n\n= 4 T m_p c² + 4 m_p² c^4 - 2 T m_p c²\n\n= 2 T m_p c² + 4 m_p² c^4\n\nBut this invariant must equal (E_cm)^2 = (m_π + m_D)^2 c^4\n\nSo:\n\n2 T m_p c² + 4 m_p² c^4 = (m_π + m_D)^2 c^4\n\nDivide both sides by c^4:\n\n2 T m_p / c² + 4 m_p² = (m_π + m_D)^2\n\nThen solving for T:\n\n2 T m_p / c² = (m_π + m_D)^2 - 4 m_p²\n\nMultiply both sides by c²/(2 m_p):\n\nT = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 - 4 m_p² ] c² / (2 m_p )\n\nBut wait, the units here: m_p, m_π, m_D are given in MeV/c², so when we compute (m_π + m_D)^2, it's (MeV/c²)^2. Then subtract 4 m_p² (same units). Then multiply by c², which would give (MeV²/c²). Then divide by 2 m_p (MeV/c²), so units would be (MeV²/c²) / (MeV/c²) ) = MeV. So the units check out.\n\nTherefore, the threshold kinetic energy T is:\n\nT = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 - 4 m_p^2 ] c² / (2 m_p )\n\nBut since the masses are given in MeV/c², when we compute (m_π + m_D)^2 - 4 m_p^2, we can compute it in (MeV/c²)^2, multiply by c², which cancels one c² in the denominator, then divide by 2 m_p (MeV/c²), so the c² cancels appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, since the masses are given in MeV/c², let's compute the numerator:\n\n(m_π + m_D)^2 - 4 m_p^2 = (140 + 1874)^2 - 4*(938)^2\n\nCompute 140 + 1874 = 2014\n\n2014^2 = 2014*2014. Let's compute that:\n\n2000^2 = 4,000,000\n\n14^2 = 196\n\n2*2000*14 = 56,000\n\nSo (2000 +14)^2 = 4,000,000 + 56,000 + 196 = 4,056,196\n\nThen 4*(938)^2 = 4*(938*938). Let's compute 938^2:\n\n900^2 = 810,000\n\n38^2 = 1,444\n\n2*900*38 = 68,400\n\nSo (900 +38)^2 = 810,000 + 68,400 + 1,444 = 879,844\n\nMultiply by 4: 879,844 *4 = 3,519,376\n\nSo numerator is 4,056,196 - 3,519,376 = 536,820 (MeV/c²)^2\n\nMultiply by c²: 536,820 (MeV/c²)^2 * c² = 536,820 MeV²\n\nDivide by 2 m_p: 2*938 MeV/c² = 1876 MeV/c²\n\nSo T = 536,820 MeV² / 1876 MeV/c² * c² ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the formula is:\n\nT = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 - 4 m_p^2 ] c² / (2 m_p )\n\nBut since m_π, m_D, m_p are in MeV/c², then (m_π + m_D)^2 is (MeV/c²)^2. Then subtract 4 m_p^2 (same units). Multiply by c² gives (MeV/c²)^2 * c² = MeV² / c² * c² = MeV². Then divide by (2 m_p) which is in MeV/c². So:\n\n[MeV²] / [MeV/c²] = MeV * c². Wait, but T is supposed to be in MeV (since it's kinetic energy). Hmm, maybe I messed up the units.\n\nWait, let's re-express the formula properly. Let me write all terms with units:\n\nNumerator: (m_π + m_D)^2 - 4 m_p^2 = (2014 MeV/c²)^2 - 4*(938 MeV/c²)^2 = (2014² - 4*938²) (MeV/c²)^2\n\nMultiply by c²: (2014² - 4*938²) (MeV²/c²)\n\nDivide by 2 m_p: 2 * 938 MeV/c²\n\nSo T = [ (2014² - 4*938²) MeV²/c² ] / (2 * 938 MeV/c² ) = [ (2014² - 4*938²) / (2*938) ] MeV\n\nBecause (MeV²/c²) divided by (MeV/c²) gives MeV.\n\nSo compute the numerical value:\n\nFirst, compute 2014² = 4,056,196\n\n4*938² = 4*879,844 = 3,519,376\n\nDifference: 4,056,196 - 3,519,376 = 536,820\n\nDivide by (2*938) = 1876\n\n536,820 / 1876 ≈ Let's compute this division.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 4: 536,820 ÷4 = 134,205; 1876 ÷4=469\n\n134,205 / 469 ≈ 286.0 (since 469*286 = 469*(280+6) = 469*280=131,320 + 469*6=2,814 → 134,134). Close. The actual value is 536,820 ÷ 1876 ≈ 286.0 MeV.\n\nWait, but 536,820 ÷ 1876:\n\nLet me do 1876 * 286 = 1876*(200 + 80 +6) = 1876*200=375,200; 1876*80=150,080; 1876*6=11,256. Sum: 375,200 +150,080=525,280 +11,256=536,536. So 1876*286=536,536. The numerator is 536,820. So 536,820 -536,536=284. So 286 + 284/1876 ≈286 +0.151≈286.15 MeV.\n\nSo T≈286.15 MeV. But let me check the exact calculation.\n\nWait, 536,820 divided by 1876:\n\n1876 * 286 = 536,536\n\n536,820 - 536,536 = 284\n\nSo 284 /1876 ≈0.1513\n\nSo total T≈286.15 MeV.\n\nBut let me check if the initial calculation was correct. Wait, the formula was T = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 - 4 m_p^2 ] c² / (2 m_p )\n\nBut m_π + m_D = 140 + 1874 = 2014 MeV/c²\n\nSo (2014)^2 = 2014*2014. Let me compute that again:\n\n2000*2000=4,000,000\n\n2000*14=28,000\n\n14*2000=28,000\n\n14*14=196\n\nSo (2000+14)^2=2000² + 2*2000*14 +14²=4,000,000 +56,000 +196=4,056,196\n\n4 m_p²=4*(938)^2=4*(879,844)=3,519,376\n\nDifference:4,056,196 -3,519,376=536,820\n\nDivide by 2 m_p=2*938=1876\n\n536,820 /1876=286.15 MeV\n\nSo T≈286.15 MeV. But the problem says to express T in terms of m_p, m_π, m_D, and then evaluate. So the symbolic answer is T = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 - 4 m_p^2 ] / (2 m_p ) multiplied by c²? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is:\n\nT = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 - 4 m_p^2 ] c² / (2 m_p )\n\nBut since the masses are in units where c=1 (like MeV/c²), then when we write the formula, the c² is already accounted for. Wait, maybe the formula is:\n\nT = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 - (2 m_p)^2 ] / (2 m_p )\n\nBut since 2 m_p is the sum of the rest masses of the initial particles (since two protons). Wait, but the initial rest mass is 2 m_p, and the final rest mass is m_π + m_D. The threshold condition is when the CM energy equals the sum of the rest masses of the products. So the threshold energy is when the CM energy squared is (m_π + m_D)^2 c^4.\n\nThe CM energy squared is (E_lab)^2 - (p_lab c)^2 = (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2. Since in lab frame, target is at rest, so sum p is just the incident proton's momentum.\n\nBut we already did that and arrived at T = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 - 4 m_p^2 ] c² / (2 m_p )\n\nBut let me check another approach. The threshold condition can also be found by considering that in the CM frame, the total energy is the sum of the rest masses of the products. So the minimum energy required is when the initial particles have just enough energy to create the products at rest.\n\nThe initial total energy in the CM frame must be equal to the sum of the rest energies of the products. But the initial particles are two protons. The energy in the CM frame is sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2 ). But since in the lab frame, one proton is moving and the other is at rest, the CM energy is sqrt( (E_lab)^2 - (p_lab c)^2 ) = sqrt( (T + 2 m_p c²)^2 - (p_lab c)^2 )\n\nBut we already did this and equated it to (m_π + m_D) c².\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for threshold energy in two-body reactions:\n\nThe threshold kinetic energy is given by T = [ (Σ m_f )^2 - (Σ m_i )^2 ] / (2 m_target )\n\nWhere Σ m_f is the sum of the rest masses of the products, and Σ m_i is the sum of the rest masses of the initial particles.\n\nHere, Σ m_f = m_π + m_D, and Σ m_i = 2 m_p.\n\nSo T = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 - (2 m_p)^2 ] / (2 m_p )\n\nBut since the target is a proton at rest, m_target = m_p.\n\nSo yes, T = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 - (2 m_p)^2 ] / (2 m_p )\n\nWhich is the same as [ (m_π + m_D)^2 - 4 m_p^2 ] / (2 m_p )\n\nMultiply by c² to get the units right if masses are in MeV/c². Wait, but if we are working in units where c=1, then the formula is as above. But since the answer is to be expressed in terms of the masses (which are given in MeV/c²), then the formula would be:\n\nT = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 - (2 m_p)^2 ] c² / (2 m_p )\n\nBut since (m_π + m_D) and m_p are in MeV/c², when we square them, we get (MeV²/c^4), multiply by c² gives MeV²/c². Then divide by m_p (MeV/c²), so overall:\n\n[ (MeV²/c^4) * c² ] / (MeV/c²) ) = (MeV²/c²) / (MeV/c²) ) = MeV.\n\nYes, so the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the symbolic answer is T = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 - 4 m_p^2 ] c² / (2 m_p )\n\nAnd numerically, plugging in the values:\n\nT = [ (140 + 1874)^2 - 4*(938)^2 ] / (2*938 ) MeV\n\nWhich gives approximately 286.15 MeV. Rounding to a reasonable number, maybe 286 MeV. But let's check the exact calculation again.\n\nWait, 2014² = 4,056,196\n\n4*938²=4*879,844=3,519,376\n\nDifference:4,056,196 -3,519,376=536,820\n\nDivide by 2*938=1876:\n\n536,820 ÷1876=286.15 MeV.\n\nSo the answer is approximately 286 MeV. But let's see if the exact value is 286.15, which rounds to 286.2 MeV. But maybe the exact answer is 286 MeV. Let me check with the given masses:\n\nm_p=938, m_D=1874, m_π=140.\n\nCompute (m_π + m_D)=2014 MeV/c².\n\nThen (2014)^2 -4*(938)^2=2014² -4*938²=4,056,196 -3,519,376=536,820.\n\nDivide by 2*938=1876:\n\n536,820 /1876=286.15 MeV.\n\nSo the answer is T≈286.15 MeV. Depending on the problem's expectation, maybe we need to keep it as a fraction or round to nearest whole number. But the exact value is 536820/1876=286.15... So boxed as \\boxed{286} MeV or \\boxed{286.2} MeV. But given the input masses are integers, perhaps the answer is 286 MeV.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let's use natural units where c=1.\n\nThen the formula is T = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 - (2 m_p)^2 ] / (2 m_p )\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n(m_π + m_D)=2014 MeV\n\n(2 m_p)=1876 MeV\n\nSo (2014)^2 - (1876)^2 = (2014-1876)(2014+1876)=138*3890=138*3890.\n\nCompute 138*3890:\n\n138*3000=414,000\n\n138*890=138*(800+90)=110,400 +12,420=122,820\n\nTotal=414,000+122,820=536,820 MeV²\n\nThen divide by 2 m_p=1876 MeV:\n\n536,820 /1876=286.15 MeV.\n\nSame result. So the answer is approximately 286.15 MeV, which is about 286 MeV.\n\nBut the problem says \"evaluate T\", so we need to give the numerical value. So the answer is approximately 286 MeV. But let's check if there's a calculation mistake.\n\nWait, another way: (a+b)^2 - (2c)^2 = a² + 2ab + b² -4c². Here a=m_π, b=m_D, c=m_p.\n\nBut maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me recompute (2014)^2 and 4*(938)^2.\n\n2014*2014:\n\n2000²=4,000,000\n\n14²=196\n\n2*2000*14=56,000\n\nTotal=4,000,000+56,000+196=4,056,196\n\n4*(938)^2=4*(938*938)=4*879,844=3,519,376\n\nDifference=4,056,196-3,519,376=536,820\n\nDivide by 2*938=1876:\n\n536,820/1876=286.15\n\nYes, so 286.15 MeV. So the answer is approximately 286 MeV. Depending on significant figures, since the given masses are all three digits (except m_π=140 which is three digits), the result should have three significant figures, so 286 MeV.\n\nBut the problem might expect an exact fraction. 536820 divided by 1876. Let's see:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 4: 536820 ÷4=134,205; 1876 ÷4=469.\n\n134,205 ÷469. Let's see how many times 469 fits into 134,205.\n\n469*286=134,134 (since 469*280=131,320; 469*6=2,814; 131,320+2,814=134,134)\n\n134,205 -134,134=71. So 286 +71/469≈286.15. So yes, 286.15 MeV.\n\nBut the problem says \"evaluate T\", so we can write the exact value as 536820/(2*938)=536820/1876=286.15 MeV. So boxed as \\boxed{286\\,\\text{MeV}} or \\boxed{286.2\\,\\text{MeV}}.\n\nBut given that the input values are integers, and the calculation gives approximately 286.15, which rounds to 286.2, but maybe the exact answer is 286.1 MeV. However, given that in exams, such answers are often left as fractions, but here it's a decimal. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is written as (m_π + m_D)^2/(4 m_p) - 2 m_p. Let's see:\n\nWait, expanding the formula:\n\nT = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 -4 m_p² ]/(2 m_p )\n\n= (m_π + m_D)^2/(2 m_p ) - 2 m_p\n\nBut (m_π + m_D)^2/(2 m_p ) - 2 m_p\n\nBut when evaluated, this gives the same as before. So perhaps expressing it in terms of the given variables.\n\nBut the problem says to express T in terms of m_p, m_π, m_D, then evaluate. So the symbolic answer is T = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 -4 m_p² ]/(2 m_p ) multiplied by c²? Wait, no, because the masses are in MeV/c², so when we compute (m_π + m_D)^2, it's (MeV/c²)^2. Multiply by c² gives (MeV²/c²). Then divide by (2 m_p ) which is in MeV/c². So the units become (MeV²/c²)/(MeV/c²)=MeV. So the formula is correct as T = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 -4 m_p² ] c²/(2 m_p )\n\nBut since in particle physics, we often set c=1, so the formula is T = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 -4 m_p² ]/(2 m_p )\n\nBut given that the masses are given in MeV/c², and the answer is in MeV, we need to include the c². Wait, no. If we use units where c=1, then the masses are in MeV, and the formula gives T in MeV. But if the masses are given in MeV/c², then to get T in MeV, we need to multiply by c². For example, m_p is 938 MeV/c². So (m_π + m_D) is 2014 MeV/c². Then (m_π + m_D)^2 is (2014 MeV/c²)^2 = 2014² MeV²/c^4. Multiply by c² gives 2014² MeV²/c². Then subtract 4 m_p² c^4, but wait, no. Wait, the formula is:\n\nT = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 c^4 - (2 m_p c²)^2 ] / (2 m_p c² )\n\nBecause the rest energy of the products is (m_π + m_D)c², and the initial rest energy is 2 m_p c². Then the threshold condition requires that the total energy in the CM frame is (m_π + m_D)c². The total energy squared minus (total momentum c)^2 is invariant.\n\nSo the correct formula is:\n\n[ (E_lab) ]^2 - [ p_lab c ]^2 = [ (m_π + m_D)c² ]^2\n\nE_lab = T + 2 m_p c² (since the incident proton has energy T + m_p c² and the target is m_p c²)\n\np_lab c = sqrt( (T + m_p c²)^2 - (m_p c²)^2 )\n\nSo expanding:\n\n(T + 2 m_p c²)^2 - [ (T + m_p c²)^2 - (m_p c²)^2 ] = (m_π + m_D)^2 c^4\n\nExpand left side:\n\nT² +4 T m_p c² +4 m_p² c^4 - [ T² + 2 T m_p c² + m_p² c^4 - m_p² c^4 ]\n\n= T² +4 T m_p c² +4 m_p² c^4 - T² -2 T m_p c²\n\n= 2 T m_p c² +4 m_p² c^4\n\nSet equal to (m_π + m_D)^2 c^4:\n\n2 T m_p c² +4 m_p² c^4 = (m_π + m_D)^2 c^4\n\nDivide both sides by c^4:\n\n2 T m_p +4 m_p² = (m_π + m_D)^2\n\nSolve for T:\n\nT = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 -4 m_p² ] / (2 m_p )\n\nWhich is the formula in natural units where c=1. So the answer is T = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 -4 m_p² ] / (2 m_p )\n\nBut since the masses are given in MeV/c², when we compute (m_π + m_D)^2, it's (MeV/c²)^2. To get T in MeV, we need to multiply by c². Wait, but in the formula above, if we use the masses in MeV/c², then (m_π + m_D)^2 has units (MeV²/c^4), and 4 m_p² is also (MeV²/c^4). Then subtracting them gives (MeV²/c^4). Then dividing by 2 m_p (MeV/c²) gives (MeV²/c^4)/(MeV/c²)=MeV/c². Then multiply by c² to get MeV. Wait, but in the derivation above, we divided by c^4, so maybe there's a confusion in units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula in SI units is:\n\nT = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 - (2 m_p)^2 ] c² / (2 m_p )\n\nBut given that the masses are in MeV/c², then:\n\n(m_π + m_D) in MeV/c², so (m_π + m_D)^2 is (MeV/c²)^2. Multiply by c² gives MeV²/c². Then subtract (2 m_p)^2 c², but no, the formula is:\n\n[ (m_π + m_D)^2 - (2 m_p)^2 ] c² / (2 m_p )\n\nBut (m_π + m_D)^2 and (2 m_p)^2 are both in (MeV/c²)^2. Multiply by c² gives (MeV²/c²). Then divide by 2 m_p (MeV/c²) gives MeV.\n\nYes, so the formula is T = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 - (2 m_p)^2 ] c² / (2 m_p )\n\nBut since (2 m_p)^2 =4 m_p², this is the same as before.\n\nTherefore, the answer is T = [ (m_π + m_D)^2 -4 m_p² ] c² / (2 m_p )\n\nBut when plugging in the numbers, since the masses are given in MeV/c², the c² cancels appropriately, and we get T in MeV.\n\nSo the final answer is T≈286 MeV.\n\nFor part (a), the threshold kinetic energy is approximately 286 MeV.\n\nNow, moving to part (b). The reaction is isotropic in the CM system. We need to find the normalized probability per unit solid angle in the lab frame, expressed in terms of cosθ_lab, β (velocity of CM), β_π (velocity of π+ in lab), and p* (momentum in CM).\n\nWhen a distribution is isotropic in the CM frame, the differential cross-section is uniform in dΩ*. But when transforming to the lab frame, the angles and solid angles change. The probability in the lab frame will depend on the Jacobian of the transformation from CM angles to lab angles.\n\nThe general approach is to relate the differential probability in the lab to that in the CM. Since the reaction is isotropic in CM, the probability in CM is dP/dΩ* = 1/(4π). To find dP/dΩ_lab, we need to relate dΩ* to dΩ_lab.\n\nThe transformation between angles involves the velocity of the CM frame relative to the lab frame. Let’s denote the velocity of the CM as β_cm c. The pion's velocity in the lab is β_π c. The momentum of the pion in the CM frame is p*.\n\nThe relation between the angles in the lab and CM frames can be found using Lorentz transformations for velocities or using the relation between momenta.\n\nThe standard formula for the differential cross-section transformation is:\n\ndσ/dΩ_lab = (dσ/dΩ*) * (dΩ*/dΩ_lab )\n\nBut since the problem asks for the normalized probability per unit solid angle, which is similar to the differential cross-section normalized by the total cross-section. Since the reaction is isotropic in CM, dP/dΩ* = 1/(4π).\n\nTo find dP/dΩ_lab, we need to compute the Jacobian determinant |d(cosθ*)/d(cosθ_lab)| * (dφ*/dφ_lab). Since the problem states it's isotropic, φ* is uniformly distributed, and if the lab frame is azimuthally symmetric, then φ_lab = φ*, so dφ*/dφ_lab =1. Therefore, the Jacobian is |d(cosθ*)/d(cosθ_lab)|.\n\nThe relation between θ_lab and θ* can be derived from the Lorentz boost from CM to lab. The CM frame is moving with velocity β_cm relative to the lab frame. The pion's velocity in the CM frame is v* = p* c² / E*, where E* is the energy in CM frame. But since the reaction is isotropic in CM, the direction of v* is random.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation for velocities is:\n\nu_parallel = (u*_parallel + v_cm) / (1 + (u*_parallel v_cm)/c² )\n\nu_perp = u*_perp / [ γ_cm (1 + (u*_parallel v_cm)/c² ) ]\n\nWhere u_parallel and u_perp are the components of the velocity in the lab frame parallel and perpendicular to the CM velocity, and u* are the components in the CM frame.\n\nBut since we are dealing with angles, it's easier to relate the angles through the velocity addition. Alternatively, use the relation between the momenta.\n\nAlternatively, use the relation between the directions in the two frames. The pion's momentum in the lab frame is related to its momentum in the CM frame by a Lorentz boost.\n\nLet’s denote the CM frame is moving along the z-axis with velocity β_cm c relative to the lab frame. The pion's momentum in the CM frame is p* at angles (θ*, φ*). The Lorentz boost transforms the momentum components.\n\nThe Lorentz boost equations for momentum are:\n\np_parallel = γ_cm (p*_parallel + β_cm E*/c )\n\np_perp = p*_perp\n\nWhere p_parallel is the component along the boost direction (z-axis), and p_perp is the transverse component.\n\nThe energy in the lab frame is E_lab = γ_cm (E* + β_cm c p*_parallel )\n\nThe angle θ_lab in the lab frame is given by tanθ_lab = p_perp / p_parallel = [ p*_perp ] / [ γ_cm (p*_parallel + β_cm E*/c ) ]\n\nBut p*_parallel = p* cosθ*, and p*_perp = p* sinθ*.\n\nSo tanθ_lab = [ p* sinθ* ] / [ γ_cm (p* cosθ* + β_cm E*/c ) ]\n\nBut E* in the CM frame is sqrt( (p* c)^2 + (m_π c²)^2 ) / c² ?\n\nWait, E* is the energy of the pion in the CM frame, which is E* = sqrt( (p* c)^2 + m_π² c^4 ) / c² ?\n\nNo, E* has units of energy. So E* = sqrt( (p* c)^2 + m_π² c^4 )\n\nBut in natural units where c=1, E* = sqrt( p*² + m_π² )\n\nBut let's keep c explicit.\n\nSo E* = sqrt( (p* c)^2 + (m_π c²)^2 )\n\nTherefore, substituting into the expression for tanθ_lab:\n\ntanθ_lab = [ p* sinθ* ] / [ γ_cm (p* cosθ* + β_cm sqrt( (p* c)^2 + (m_π c²)^2 ) / c ) ]\n\nThis seems complicated. Alternatively, we can express in terms of β* = v*/c = p* c / E*.\n\nSince in the CM frame, the pion has velocity β* c = p* c² / E*.\n\nSo β* = p* c / E*.\n\nThen E* = sqrt( (p* c)^2 + m_π² c^4 ) / c² → E* = sqrt( p*² c² + m_π² c^4 ) / c² ?\n\nWait, no. E* is energy, so E* = sqrt( (p* c)^2 + (m_π c²)^2 )\n\nTherefore, β* = (p* c) / E* = (p* c) / sqrt( (p* c)^2 + (m_π c²)^2 )\n\n= p* / sqrt( p*² + m_π² c² )\n\nBut maybe it's better to define variables in terms of β_cm and β*.\n\nAlternatively, use the relation between the angles in terms of the velocities.\n\nThe angle in the lab frame θ_lab is related to the angle in the CM", "final_answers": ["286", "286.2", "286\\,\\text{MeV}", "286.2\\,\\text{MeV}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "286", "expr2": "T = \\frac{(m_\\pi + m_D)^2 - 4m_p^2}{2m_p} = 286.2 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "286", "expr2": "\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{m_\\pi \\beta \\gamma}{4\\pi \\overline{\\gamma} p^* (1 - \\overline{\\beta} \\cos \\theta / \\beta)}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": "missing '}' at '^'\n\\frac{mi \\beta \\gamma}{4\\pi \\overline{\\gamma} p^* (1 - \\overline{\\beta} \\cos \\theta / \\beta)}\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^"}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "286.2", "expr2": "T = \\frac{(m_\\pi + m_D)^2 - 4m_p^2}{2m_p} = 286.2 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "286\\,\\text{MeV}", "expr2": "T = \\frac{(m_\\pi + m_D)^2 - 4m_p^2}{2m_p} = 286.2 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "286\\,\\text{MeV}", "expr2": "\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{m_\\pi \\beta \\gamma}{4\\pi \\overline{\\gamma} p^* (1 - \\overline{\\beta} \\cos \\theta / \\beta)}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "286.2\\,\\text{MeV}", "expr2": "T = \\frac{(m_\\pi + m_D)^2 - 4m_p^2}{2m_p} = 286.2 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "286.2\\,\\text{MeV}", "expr2": "\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{m_\\pi \\beta \\gamma}{4\\pi \\overline{\\gamma} p^* (1 - \\overline{\\beta} \\cos \\theta / \\beta)}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.25}
{"id": "atomic/4-35", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve part (a) and (b) of this Compton scattering problem. Let me start by recalling what I know about Compton scattering. From what I remember, Compton scattering involves a photon colliding with a free electron, which is initially at rest. After the collision, the photon is scattered at some angle θ, and its wavelength changes. The electron recoils, gaining some kinetic energy. \n\nFor part (a), the question is to compute the scattered photon's wavelength λ' in terms of the initial wavelength λ, the scattering angle θ, and universal parameters. I think the key formula here is the Compton scattering formula. Let me try to recall that. I think it's something like the change in wavelength (λ' - λ) equals a constant multiplied by (1 - cosθ). The constant probably involves Planck's constant h, the mass of the electron m_e, and the speed of light c. Let me check that. \n\nYes, the formula should be λ' - λ = (h/(m_e c)) (1 - cosθ). So rearranged, λ' = λ + (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ). That makes sense. The term h/(m_e c) is known as the Compton wavelength of the electron, right? So that's a universal constant. Therefore, the answer for part (a) is λ' equals the original wavelength plus the Compton wavelength times (1 minus cosine theta). \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up any terms. Let's derive it quickly to confirm. \n\nThe derivation starts with conservation of energy and momentum. The photon's initial momentum is h/λ divided by c, so p_photon_initial = h/(λ c). After scattering, the photon's momentum is h/(λ' c) in a direction θ. The electron, initially at rest, gains momentum. Let's denote the electron's momentum as p_e. \n\nConservation of momentum in the x-direction (assuming the photon is moving along the x-axis initially) gives: \n\nh/(λ c) = (h/(λ' c)) cosθ + p_e cosφ\n\nWhere φ is the angle of the electron's momentum. Similarly, in the y-direction:\n\n0 = (h/(λ' c)) sinθ - p_e sinφ\n\nThen conservation of energy: the initial energy is the photon's energy hc/λ plus the electron's rest energy m_e c². After scattering, the photon's energy is hc/λ', and the electron's total energy is sqrt((p_e c)^2 + (m_e c²)^2). So:\n\nhc/λ + m_e c² = hc/λ' + sqrt((p_e c)^2 + (m_e c²)^2)\n\nThis seems complicated. But I remember that combining the momentum equations and the energy equation leads to the Compton formula. Let me see if there's a smarter way. \n\nAlternatively, using the relativistic equations for conservation of energy and momentum. Let me denote the initial photon momentum as p = h/λ, and the scattered photon momentum as p' = h/λ'. The electron's rest mass is m_e. \n\nThe energy conservation equation is:\n\np c + m_e c² = p' c + sqrt( (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c²)^2 )\n\nMomentum conservation in vector form:\n\np = p' + p_e\n\nTaking the square of the momentum conservation equation (as vectors):\n\np² = p'² + p_e² + 2 p' · p_e\n\nBut since p and p' are vectors, the dot product p' · p_e can be expressed in terms of the angle between them. Wait, maybe another approach. Let's square the momentum vectors. Let me denote the angle between the initial photon direction and the scattered photon direction as θ. Then, the angle between the initial photon momentum (p) and the scattered photon momentum (p') is θ. So, the momentum of the electron is p_e = p - p'. \n\nTherefore, the magnitude squared of p_e is |p - p'|² = p² + p'² - 2 p p' cosθ. \n\nSo, p_e² = p² + p'² - 2 p p' cosθ. \n\nNow, plugging into the energy equation. Let's write the energy equation again:\n\np c + m_e c² = p' c + sqrt( p_e² c² + m_e² c^4 )\n\nSubtract p' c from both sides:\n\n(p - p') c + m_e c² = sqrt( p_e² c² + m_e² c^4 )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n[ (p - p') c + m_e c² ]² = p_e² c² + m_e² c^4\n\nExpand the left side:\n\n(p - p')² c² + 2 (p - p') c * m_e c² + m_e² c^4 = p_e² c² + m_e² c^4\n\nSubtract m_e² c^4 from both sides:\n\n(p - p')² c² + 2 (p - p') c * m_e c² = p_e² c²\n\nBut from earlier, p_e² = p² + p'² - 2 p p' cosθ. So substitute that into the right side:\n\n(p - p')² c² + 2 (p - p') c * m_e c² = (p² + p'² - 2 p p' cosθ) c²\n\nLet me expand (p - p')²:\n\n(p² - 2 p p' + p'²) c² + 2 (p - p') m_e c³ = (p² + p'² - 2 p p' cosθ) c²\n\nDivide both sides by c²:\n\n(p² - 2 p p' + p'²) + 2 (p - p') m_e c = p² + p'² - 2 p p' cosθ\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\np² - 2 p p' + p'² + 2 m_e c (p - p') = p² + p'² - 2 p p' cosθ\n\nSubtract p² + p'² from both sides:\n\n-2 p p' + 2 m_e c (p - p') = -2 p p' cosθ\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n-2 p p' + 2 m_e c (p - p') + 2 p p' cosθ = 0\n\nFactor terms:\n\n2 p p' (-1 + cosθ) + 2 m_e c (p - p') = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\np p' (-1 + cosθ) + m_e c (p - p') = 0\n\nLet's rearrange terms:\n\nm_e c (p - p') = p p' (1 - cosθ)\n\nDivide both sides by p p' m_e c:\n\n( (p - p') ) / (p p') = (1 - cosθ) / (m_e c)\n\nBut p = h/λ and p' = h/λ', so substituting:\n\n( (h/λ - h/λ') ) / ( (h/λ)(h/λ') ) ) = (1 - cosθ)/(m_e c)\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nh (1/λ - 1/λ') = h ( (λ' - λ)/(λ λ') )\n\nDenominator is h²/(λ λ')\n\nSo the left side becomes:\n\n[ h ( (λ' - λ)/(λ λ') ) ] / ( h²/(λ λ') ) ) = (λ' - λ)/h\n\nTherefore:\n\n(λ' - λ)/h = (1 - cosθ)/(m_e c)\n\nMultiply both sides by h:\n\nλ' - λ = h/(m_e c) (1 - cosθ)\n\nWhich gives:\n\nλ' = λ + (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ)\n\nYes, that matches the formula I remembered. So part (a) is solved. The scattered wavelength λ' is the initial wavelength plus the Compton wavelength shift term. \n\nNow moving to part (b), compute the kinetic energy of the recoiled electron. The kinetic energy (K.E.) of the electron is the total energy gained, which is its total energy after scattering minus its rest mass energy. So K.E. = E_e - m_e c². \n\nFrom the energy conservation equation earlier:\n\nhc/λ + m_e c² = hc/λ' + E_e\n\nTherefore, E_e = hc/λ - hc/λ' + m_e c²\n\nBut the kinetic energy is E_e - m_e c² = hc(1/λ - 1/λ')\n\nSo K.E. = hc (1/λ - 1/λ') \n\nAlternatively, we can express this in terms of the wavelength shift. Since λ' = λ + Δλ, where Δλ = (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ), then:\n\n1/λ - 1/λ' = (λ' - λ)/(λ λ') = Δλ/(λ λ')\n\nBut substituting Δλ = (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ), we get:\n\nK.E. = hc * [ (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ) ] / (λ λ') \n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, using the relation between the photon's energy loss and the electron's kinetic energy. The kinetic energy of the electron is equal to the energy lost by the photon. So K.E. = E_photon_initial - E_photon_final = hc/λ - hc/λ'\n\nWhich is the same as above. So K.E. = hc (1/λ - 1/λ') \n\nBut we can express this in terms of θ by using the result from part (a). Since λ' = λ + (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ), let's substitute that into the expression for K.E.:\n\nK.E. = hc [ 1/λ - 1/(λ + (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ)) ]\n\nThis is a valid expression, but maybe we can simplify it further. Let's denote Δλ = λ' - λ = (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ). Then:\n\nK.E. = hc [ (Δλ) / (λ (λ + Δλ)) ]\n\nBut substituting Δλ:\n\nK.E. = hc [ (h/(m_e c)(1 - cosθ)) / (λ (λ + h/(m_e c)(1 - cosθ)) ) ]\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe there's another approach. Let's consider using the Compton formula and express the kinetic energy in terms of θ. Alternatively, use the relation between the photon's energy and the scattering angle. \n\nAlternatively, using conservation of energy and momentum. Let me think. The kinetic energy of the electron is K = E_e - m_e c². From earlier, E_e = sqrt( (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c²)^2 ). So K = sqrt( (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c²)^2 ) - m_e c². \n\nBut maybe this is not easier. Alternatively, using the relation from part (a), we can express 1/λ' in terms of 1/λ and θ. Let's see. From part (a):\n\nλ' = λ + (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ)\n\nSo 1/λ' = 1 / [ λ + (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ) ]\n\nTherefore, K.E. = hc (1/λ - 1/λ') = hc [ 1/λ - 1/(λ + (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ)) ]\n\nThis is the exact expression, but perhaps we can manipulate it to a more standard form. Let's factor out 1/λ from the denominator in the second term:\n\n1/(λ + (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ)) = 1/[ λ (1 + (h/(m_e c λ))(1 - cosθ)) ] = (1/λ) * 1/[1 + (h/(m_e c λ))(1 - cosθ)]\n\nSo substituting back:\n\nK.E. = hc [ 1/λ - (1/λ) * 1/(1 + (h/(m_e c λ))(1 - cosθ)) ) ]\n\nFactor out hc/λ:\n\nK.E. = (hc/λ) [ 1 - 1/(1 + (h/(m_e c λ))(1 - cosθ)) ]\n\nLet me denote the term (h/(m_e c λ))(1 - cosθ) as x. Then:\n\nK.E. = (hc/λ) [ 1 - 1/(1 + x) ] = (hc/λ) [ x / (1 + x) ]\n\nSo substituting x back:\n\nK.E. = (hc/λ) [ (h/(m_e c λ))(1 - cosθ) / (1 + (h/(m_e c λ))(1 - cosθ)) ) ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: h/(m_e c λ) * (1 - cosθ)\n\nDenominator: 1 + h/(m_e c λ) (1 - cosθ)\n\nSo:\n\nK.E. = [ hc/λ * h/(m_e c λ) (1 - cosθ) ] / [1 + h/(m_e c λ)(1 - cosθ) ]\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nh^2 c (1 - cosθ) / (m_e c λ²) ) = h² (1 - cosθ)/(m_e λ²)\n\nDenominator: 1 + h/(m_e c λ)(1 - cosθ)\n\nSo overall:\n\nK.E. = [ h² (1 - cosθ)/(m_e λ²) ] / [1 + h/(m_e c λ)(1 - cosθ) ]\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Let's recall that the energy of the photon before scattering is E = hc/λ, and after scattering it's E' = hc/λ'. The kinetic energy of the electron is E - E' = hc(1/λ - 1/λ'). From part (a), we have λ' - λ = (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ). Let's express 1/λ - 1/λ' as (λ' - λ)/(λ λ') = Δλ/(λ λ'). So substituting Δλ:\n\nK.E. = hc * Δλ/(λ λ') = hc * [ (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ) ] / (λ λ') \n\nBut λ' = λ + Δλ, so λ λ' = λ (λ + Δλ) = λ² + λ Δλ. This might not help. \n\nAlternatively, express everything in terms of the initial photon energy. Let me denote E = hc/λ. Then, E' = hc/λ' = E λ / λ'. From part (a), λ' = λ + (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ). Let's write this as λ' = λ + (E λ / (m_e c²))(1 - cosθ), since E = hc/λ => h = E λ / c. Substituting h into the Compton formula:\n\nΔλ = ( (E λ / c ) / (m_e c) ) (1 - cosθ) ) = (E λ)/(m_e c²) (1 - cosθ)\n\nTherefore, λ' = λ + (E λ)/(m_e c²) (1 - cosθ) = λ [1 + (E)/(m_e c²) (1 - cosθ) ]\n\nThen, the kinetic energy K.E. = E - E' = E - (E λ)/λ' = E [1 - λ / λ' ]\n\nSubstituting λ' from above:\n\nK.E. = E [1 - λ / (λ [1 + (E/(m_e c²))(1 - cosθ) ]) ] = E [1 - 1/(1 + (E/(m_e c²))(1 - cosθ)) ]\n\nLet me denote α = E/(m_e c²). Then:\n\nK.E. = E [1 - 1/(1 + α(1 - cosθ)) ] = E [ (α(1 - cosθ)) / (1 + α(1 - cosθ)) ]\n\nSo substituting back α = E/(m_e c²):\n\nK.E. = E [ (E/(m_e c²) (1 - cosθ)) / (1 + E/(m_e c²)(1 - cosθ)) ]\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by m_e c²:\n\nK.E. = E [ E (1 - cosθ) / (m_e c² + E (1 - cosθ)) ]\n\nBut E = hc/λ, so substituting:\n\nK.E. = (hc/λ) [ (hc/λ)(1 - cosθ) / (m_e c² + (hc/λ)(1 - cosθ)) ]\n\nFactor out m_e c² in the denominator:\n\nK.E. = (hc/λ) [ (hc/λ)(1 - cosθ) / (m_e c² [1 + (hc/λ)/(m_e c²) (1 - cosθ) ]) ]\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\nm_e c² [1 + (h/(m_e c λ))(1 - cosθ) ]\n\nSo:\n\nK.E. = (hc/λ) * (hc/λ)(1 - cosθ) / (m_e c² [1 + (h/(m_e c λ))(1 - cosθ) ]) )\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n(hc/λ)^2 (1 - cosθ)\n\nDenominator:\n\nm_e c² [1 + (h/(m_e c λ))(1 - cosθ) ]\n\nSo:\n\nK.E. = [ h² c² (1 - cosθ) ] / [ λ² m_e c² (1 + (h/(m_e c λ))(1 - cosθ) ) ]\n\nCancel c²:\n\nK.E. = [ h² (1 - cosθ) ] / [ λ² m_e (1 + (h/(m_e c λ))(1 - cosθ) ) ]\n\nThis seems similar to what I had earlier. Maybe this is as simplified as it gets. Alternatively, using the Compton formula, express the kinetic energy in terms of θ. Let's see. \n\nAlternatively, using the relation between the photon's energy and the scattering angle. Let me recall another formula. The kinetic energy of the electron can also be written as:\n\nK.E. = [ (E_photon) (1 - cosθ) ] / [ 1 + (E_photon/(m_e c²))(1 - cosθ) ]\n\nWhere E_photon is the initial photon energy. Let me check if this matches our previous result. \n\nYes, because if E_photon = hc/λ, then substituting into the above formula:\n\nK.E. = [ (hc/λ)(1 - cosθ) ] / [1 + (hc/λ)/(m_e c²) (1 - cosθ) ]\n\nWhich is the same as the expression we derived. So this is another way to write it. \n\nAlternatively, we can write this in terms of the Compton wavelength. Let me recall that the Compton wavelength λ_c = h/(m_e c). So substituting h/(m_e c) = λ_c, then:\n\nK.E. = [ (hc/λ)(1 - cosθ) ] / [1 + (λ_c / λ)(1 - cosθ) ]\n\nThis might be a more compact form. \n\nAlternatively, factor out λ_c in the denominator:\n\nDenominator: 1 + (λ_c / λ)(1 - cosθ) = [ λ + λ_c (1 - cosθ) ] / λ\n\nTherefore, K.E. = [ (hc/λ)(1 - cosθ) ] / [ (λ + λ_c (1 - cosθ))/λ ] = hc (1 - cosθ) / (λ + λ_c (1 - cosθ))\n\nBut λ + λ_c (1 - cosθ) is exactly λ', from part (a). So substituting λ':\n\nK.E. = hc (1 - cosθ) / λ'\n\nBut wait, λ' = λ + λ_c (1 - cosθ), so this gives K.E. = hc (1 - cosθ)/λ'\n\nBut hc/λ' is the energy of the scattered photon. So K.E. = E' (1 - cosθ). Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. \n\nAlternatively, since K.E. = E - E', and E' = hc/λ', then:\n\nK.E. = hc (1/λ - 1/λ') = hc (λ' - λ)/(λ λ') \n\nBut from part (a), λ' - λ = λ_c (1 - cosθ), so substituting:\n\nK.E. = hc (λ_c (1 - cosθ)) / (λ λ') \n\nBut λ_c = h/(m_e c), so:\n\nK.E. = hc * (h/(m_e c) (1 - cosθ)) / (λ λ') = (h² c (1 - cosθ))/(m_e c λ λ') ) = (h² (1 - cosθ))/(m_e λ λ') \n\nBut this still involves λ and λ'. However, since λ' = λ + λ_c (1 - cosθ), we can write λ λ' = λ (λ + λ_c (1 - cosθ)). \n\nAlternatively, express in terms of the initial photon energy. Let me think. If the initial photon energy is E = hc/λ, then:\n\nK.E. = (E^2 (1 - cosθ))/(m_e c² + E (1 - cosθ))\n\nThis is another way to write it. Let me verify:\n\nStarting from K.E. = E - E'\n\nBut E' = hc/λ' = hc/(λ + Δλ) = hc/(λ + (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ)) = hc/(λ + (E λ/(m_e c²))(1 - cosθ)) \n\nWait, since E = hc/λ, then h = E λ / c. Therefore, Δλ = (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ) = (E λ/(m_e c²))(1 - cosθ). So:\n\nλ' = λ + (E λ/(m_e c²))(1 - cosθ) = λ [1 + (E/(m_e c²))(1 - cosθ)]\n\nTherefore, E' = hc/λ' = hc/(λ [1 + (E/(m_e c²))(1 - cosθ)]) ) = E / [1 + (E/(m_e c²))(1 - cosθ) ]\n\nThus, K.E. = E - E' = E - E/[1 + (E/(m_e c²))(1 - cosθ) ] = E [1 - 1/(1 + (E/(m_e c²))(1 - cosθ)) ]\n\n= E [ (E/(m_e c²))(1 - cosθ) / (1 + (E/(m_e c²))(1 - cosθ)) ]\n\n= [ E^2 (1 - cosθ) ] / [ m_e c² + E (1 - cosθ) ]\n\nWhich matches the expression above. So this is a valid expression. \n\nAlternatively, if we want to write this in terms of the initial wavelength λ, since E = hc/λ, substituting:\n\nK.E. = [ (hc/λ)^2 (1 - cosθ) ] / [ m_e c² + (hc/λ)(1 - cosθ) ]\n\nFactor out hc/λ in the denominator:\n\n= [ (hc/λ)^2 (1 - cosθ) ] / [ m_e c² (1 + (hc/λ)/(m_e c²) (1 - cosθ)) ]\n\n= [ (hc/λ)^2 (1 - cosθ) ] / [ m_e c² (1 + (h/(m_e c λ))(1 - cosθ)) ]\n\nBut h/(m_e c) is λ_c, the Compton wavelength, so:\n\n= [ (hc/λ)^2 (1 - cosθ) ] / [ m_e c² (1 + (λ_c / λ)(1 - cosθ)) ]\n\nThis is another form. \n\nAlternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by λ^2:\n\n= [ h² c² (1 - cosθ) ] / [ m_e c² λ^2 (1 + (λ_c / λ)(1 - cosθ)) ]\n\nSimplify c²:\n\n= [ h² (1 - cosθ) ] / [ m_e λ^2 (1 + (λ_c / λ)(1 - cosθ)) ]\n\nBut this seems as simplified as it can get. \n\nSo depending on how the answer is expected, there are multiple ways to express the kinetic energy. The most straightforward expression is K.E. = hc(1/λ - 1/λ'), which can be written in terms of θ using the result from part (a). Alternatively, substituting λ' from part (a), we get:\n\nK.E. = hc [ (λ' - λ) / (λ λ') ] = hc [ (h/(m_e c)(1 - cosθ)) / (λ λ') ]\n\nBut since λ' = λ + h/(m_e c)(1 - cosθ), this still requires knowing λ and λ'. \n\nAlternatively, using the expression in terms of the initial photon energy E and θ:\n\nK.E. = [ E^2 (1 - cosθ) ] / [ m_e c² + E (1 - cosθ) ]\n\nThis might be a more compact form. \n\nAlternatively, using the Compton formula, we can write:\n\nK.E. = (h c / λ) - (h c / λ') = h c (1/λ - 1/λ') = h c ( (λ' - λ) / (λ λ') )\n\nBut from part (a), λ' - λ = (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ), so substituting:\n\nK.E. = h c * ( (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ) ) / (λ λ') = (h² (1 - cosθ))/(m_e λ λ')\n\nBut since λ' = λ + (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ), this can be written as:\n\nK.E. = (h² (1 - cosθ))/(m_e λ (λ + (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ)) )\n\nThis is another valid expression. \n\nSo, depending on which variables are considered given, the answer can be expressed in different forms. The question says to compute the kinetic energy in terms of universal parameters, which would include h, m_e, c, and the given quantities λ and θ. \n\nTherefore, the answer can be written as:\n\nK.E. = (h c / λ) - (h c / λ') \n\nBut since λ' is given by part (a), substituting that in gives:\n\nK.E. = h c [ 1/λ - 1/(λ + (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ)) ]\n\nAlternatively, using the expression derived earlier:\n\nK.E. = [ (h c / λ) (1 - cosθ) ] / [ 1 + (h/(m_e c λ))(1 - cosθ) ]\n\nEither form is acceptable, but perhaps the first one is more direct. However, the second form might be considered more simplified. \n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the relation between the photon's energy and the electron's kinetic energy. The maximum kinetic energy transfer occurs when the photon is backscattered (θ = 180°), but here we need the general case. \n\nIn summary, the kinetic energy of the recoiled electron is the difference between the initial and final photon energies, which can be expressed using the Compton formula. The exact expression in terms of λ, θ, and universal constants is:\n\nK.E. = hc(1/λ - 1/λ') = hc [ (λ' - λ) / (λ λ') ] = hc [ (h/(m_e c)(1 - cosθ)) / (λ (λ + h/(m_e c)(1 - cosθ)) ) ]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\nK.E. = (h^2 (1 - cosθ))/(m_e λ (λ + h/(m_e c)(1 - cosθ)) )\n\nBut this might not be the most elegant form. Alternatively, using the expression in terms of E_photon:\n\nK.E. = [ (E_photon)^2 (1 - cosθ) ] / (m_e c² + E_photon (1 - cosθ) )\n\nWhere E_photon = hc/λ. \n\nThis seems to be a standard formula for the kinetic energy of the electron in Compton scattering. Let me verify with a textbook or online resource. \n\nUpon checking, yes, the kinetic energy of the recoil electron in Compton scattering is given by:\n\nK.E. = E_γ - E_γ' = hc(1/λ - 1/λ') \n\nAnd using the Compton shift equation, this can be expressed as:\n\nK.E. = (h c Δλ)/(λ (λ + Δλ)) \n\nWhere Δλ = (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ). \n\nAlternatively, substituting Δλ:\n\nK.E. = (h c (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ)) / (λ (λ + h/(m_e c)(1 - cosθ)) )\n\nSimplifying numerator:\n\nh^2 (1 - cosθ)/m_e \n\nDenominator:\n\nλ (λ + h/(m_e c)(1 - cosθ)) \n\nSo:\n\nK.E. = [ h^2 (1 - cosθ) ] / [ m_e λ (λ + h/(m_e c)(1 - cosθ)) ]\n\nThis is another valid expression. \n\nAlternatively, factor out λ in the denominator:\n\nDenominator: λ^2 [1 + (h/(m_e c λ))(1 - cosθ)]\n\nSo:\n\nK.E. = [ h^2 (1 - cosθ) ] / [ m_e λ^2 (1 + (h/(m_e c λ))(1 - cosθ)) ]\n\nBut this is the same as before. \n\nGiven the multiple ways to express the kinetic energy, but the problem asks to compute it, so likely either form is acceptable. However, the most compact form is probably:\n\nK.E. = \\frac{h c}{\\lambda} - \\frac{h c}{\\lambda'}\n\nBut since λ' is given in part (a), substituting that gives the answer in terms of λ, θ, and universal constants. Alternatively, using the expression involving E_photon and θ. \n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the relation:\n\nK.E. = \\frac{E_\\gamma^2 (1 - \\cos\\theta)}{m_e c^2 + E_\\gamma (1 - \\cos\\theta)}\n\nWhere E_γ = hc/λ is the initial photon energy. \n\nThis is a commonly used formula and is derived from conservation laws. Therefore, this might be the preferred form. \n\nLet me check the units to ensure correctness. \n\nE_γ has units of energy. The numerator is E_γ^2 (1 - cosθ), which is energy squared. The denominator is m_e c^2 (energy) plus E_γ (1 - cosθ) (energy). So overall, the units are energy squared divided by energy, which gives energy. Correct. \n\nTherefore, this formula is dimensionally consistent. \n\nSo substituting E_γ = hc/λ, we get:\n\nK.E. = \\frac{(hc/\\lambda)^2 (1 - \\cos\\theta)}{m_e c^2 + (hc/\\lambda)(1 - \\cos\\theta)}\n\nThis is a valid expression and is in terms of λ, θ, and universal constants h, m_e, c. \n\nTherefore, this is a suitable answer for part (b). \n\nAlternatively, we can factor out m_e c² in the denominator:\n\nK.E. = \\frac{(hc/\\lambda)^2 (1 - \\cos\\theta)}{m_e c^2 [1 + (hc/\\lambda)/(m_e c^2) (1 - \\cos\\theta)]} = \\frac{(hc/\\lambda)^2 (1 - \\cos\\theta)}{m_e c^2 [1 + (h/(m_e c \\lambda))(1 - \\cos\\theta)]}\n\nSimplifying:\n\nK.E. = \\frac{h^2 c^2 (1 - \\cos\\theta)}{m_e c^2 \\lambda^2 [1 + (h/(m_e c \\lambda))(1 - \\cos\\theta)]} = \\frac{h^2 (1 - \\cos\\theta)}{m_e \\lambda^2 [1 + (h/(m_e c \\lambda))(1 - \\cos\\theta)]}\n\nBut this is the same as before. \n\nIn conclusion, the kinetic energy can be expressed in multiple equivalent forms, but the most concise and perhaps standard form is:\n\nK.E. = \\frac{(h c / \\lambda) (1 - \\cos\\theta)}{1 + (h/(m_e c \\lambda))(1 - \\cos\\theta)}\n\nAlternatively, using the Compton wavelength λ_c = h/(m_e c):\n\nK.E. = \\frac{(h c / \\lambda) (1 - \\cos\\theta)}{1 + (\\lambda_c / \\lambda)(1 - \\cos\\theta)}\n\nThis is also a clean expression. \n\nTherefore, the answer to part (b) is this expression. \n\nTo summarize:\n\n(a) λ' = λ + (h/(m_e c))(1 - cosθ)\n\n(b) K.E. = [ (h c / λ) (1 - cosθ) ] / [ 1 + (h/(m_e c λ))(1 - cosθ) ]\n\nAlternatively, using λ_c:\n\nK.E. = [ (E_γ) (1 - cosθ) ] / [ 1 + (λ_c / λ)(1 - cosθ) ]\n\nBut since E_γ = hc/λ, this is equivalent. \n\nI think these are the correct answers.\n</think>\n\n(a) The scattered photon's wavelength \\(\\lambda'\\) is given by the Compton formula:\n\\[\n\\lambda' = \\lambda + \\frac{h}{m_e c}(1 -

{"id": "atomic/3-22", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these physics questions one by one. Starting with part (a). The question is about the decay μ⁺ → e⁺ + γ and what general principle suppresses this decay. Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, certain decays are forbidden or suppressed due to conservation laws. For example, lepton number conservation. But wait, in the Standard Model, each lepton flavor (like electron, muon, tau) has its own lepton number. So if a muon decays into an electron, that would change the lepton flavor. But wait, muon decay normally is μ⁻ → e⁻ + ν̄μ + νe, right? That conserves total lepton number but changes the flavor. However, the decay here is μ⁺ → e⁺ + γ, which doesn't have the neutrinos. So this process would violate lepton flavor conservation. But why is it suppressed? Oh, right! The Standard Model doesn't allow processes that change lepton flavor unless there's mixing, like in neutrinos. But for charged leptons, such flavor-changing processes are highly suppressed. So the principle here is probably Lepton Flavor Conservation or the absence of Lepton Flavor Violation (LFV) in the Standard Model. But wait, neutrinos do have mixing, but charged leptons don't. So the decay μ → e + γ is forbidden in the Standard Model because it violates lepton flavor conservation. Therefore, the suppression is due to the conservation of lepton flavor numbers, which is part of the Standard Model. But wait, actually, the principle is more specifically called \"Lepton Flavor Conservation,\" and the suppression comes from the fact that such processes are not allowed unless there's some beyond the Standard Model physics. So part (a)'s answer is Lepton Flavor Conservation or Lepton Flavor Violation being forbidden in the Standard Model.\n\nMoving to part (b). The setup is a stopping μ⁺ beam and two NaI crystals that detect total energy of positrons or gamma rays. How to arrange the crystals and what signal indicates the decay. So the decay μ⁺ → e⁺ + γ would produce a positron and a photon. Both should be emitted with high energy. Since the muon is stopped, it's at rest when it decays. So the decay products (e⁺ and γ) should be emitted back-to-back to conserve momentum. Because the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum of e⁺ and γ must cancel each other. So their directions should be opposite. Therefore, the two crystals should be placed on opposite sides of the target where the muons stop. One crystal detects the positron, the other the gamma. But wait, NaI crystals are typically used for gamma detection. Wait, but the positron is a charged particle. How does the NaI crystal detect it? Maybe the positron annihilates with an electron, producing two gamma rays. But in the decay μ⁺ → e⁺ + γ, the positron would have kinetic energy. If the NaI crystal is measuring total energy, then the positron would deposit its energy in the crystal, and the gamma would be detected in another. But maybe the setup is such that one crystal detects the positron's energy (if it stops in the crystal) and the other detects the gamma. But since the muon is stopped, the decay products must have total energy equal to the muon's rest mass (divided appropriately). The total energy of e⁺ and γ should sum up to the muon's rest energy (~105.7 MeV). So the signal would be both crystals firing with energies that add up to ~105.7 MeV. But how are they arranged? Since the e⁺ and γ are back-to-back, the crystals should be placed in opposite directions relative to the target. So if the target is in the center, one crystal is placed on one side, the other on the opposite side. When a decay occurs, the e⁺ goes into one crystal, the γ into the other. The sum of their energies should be the muon's mass, and their directions should be opposite. So the arrangement is two NaI crystals placed 180 degrees apart relative to the target. The signal would be coincident detection of a positron (with energy up to ~52.8 MeV, since in two-body decay the energy would be split, but wait, in a two-body decay from rest, the energies would be fixed. Wait, if the muon is at rest, and decays into e⁺ and γ, then both particles must have equal and opposite momenta. The energy of each would be determined by their masses. But the muon's mass is about 105.7 MeV, the positron's mass is 0.511 MeV, and the photon is massless. Wait, but in reality, a two-body decay of a muon into e and gamma is impossible because of conservation laws. Wait, but the question says that the decay is reported, so maybe assuming it's possible. But in reality, such a decay would require the muon to emit a photon and turn into an electron, which violates lepton flavor conservation. But in the context of the problem, we can ignore that and just think about kinematics. If the muon is at rest, then the e⁺ and γ must have opposite momenta. The energy of the photon would be E_γ = |p| c, and the energy of the e⁺ would be sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 ). The total energy would be E_γ + E_e = m_μ c². Let's compute that. Let me set c=1 for simplicity. So m_μ = 105.7 MeV, m_e = 0.511 MeV. Then:\n\nE_γ = p\n\nE_e = sqrt(p² + m_e²)\n\nTotal energy: p + sqrt(p² + m_e²) = m_μ\n\nSolving for p:\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\np² + 2 p sqrt(p² + m_e²) + p² + m_e² = m_μ²\n\nWait, that's messy. Alternatively, rearrange:\n\nsqrt(p² + m_e²) = m_μ - p\n\nSquare both sides:\n\np² + m_e² = m_μ² - 2 m_μ p + p²\n\nCancel p²:\n\nm_e² = m_μ² - 2 m_μ p\n\nThen:\n\n2 m_μ p = m_μ² - m_e²\n\np = (m_μ² - m_e²)/(2 m_μ)\n\nPlugging numbers:\n\nm_μ ≈ 105.7 MeV\n\nm_e ≈ 0.511 MeV\n\nSo numerator ≈ (105.7² - 0.511²) ≈ 11172.5 - 0.26 ≈ 11172.24 MeV²\n\nDenominator: 2 * 105.7 ≈ 211.4 MeV\n\nSo p ≈ 11172.24 / 211.4 ≈ ~52.86 MeV/c\n\nThen E_γ = p ≈ 52.86 MeV\n\nE_e = sqrt( (52.86)^2 + (0.511)^2 ) ≈ 52.86 MeV (since 0.511 is negligible)\n\nSo both the positron and photon would each have about 52.8 MeV of energy. Wait, but the total energy would be 52.8 + 52.8 ≈ 105.6 MeV, which matches the muon mass. So in this hypothetical decay, the e⁺ and γ each have about half the muon's rest energy. Therefore, the two NaI crystals should detect each with about 52.8 MeV. But since the positron is charged, it might deposit all its energy in one crystal, and the photon, being a gamma, would deposit its energy in the other. So the signal would be two crystals each detecting ~52.8 MeV, in coincidence, and in opposite directions. So arranging the crystals opposite each other relative to the target. So the answer for part (b) is that the two NaI crystals are placed on opposite sides of the stopping target, and the signal is two hits with energies summing to approximately the muon's rest mass (around 105.7 MeV), each around half of that, and in coincidence.\n\nNow part (c). The background is μ⁺ → e⁺ + ν_e + ν̄_μ + γ. The neutrinos aren't detected. How to distinguish this from the signal. In the signal, you have only e⁺ and γ, so their energies sum to the muon's mass. In the background, there's an additional photon, but also neutrinos. Wait, the background decay is a radiative muon decay: the normal decay μ⁺ → e⁺ + ν_e + ν̄_μ, but with an extra photon emitted. So in this case, the e⁺ and γ are present, but there are also two neutrinos. The neutrinos carry away some energy and momentum, so the e⁺ and γ won't have their energies sum up to the muon's mass. Because the neutrinos take some energy, the sum of e⁺ and γ energies would be less than 105.7 MeV. Whereas in the signal decay, the sum is exactly the muon mass. So the key is to look at the total energy detected. For the background, the sum would be less than 105.7 MeV, while for the signal, it's exactly that. Therefore, by requiring that the sum of the energies in the two crystals is around 105.7 MeV, you can reject background events where the sum is less. Additionally, in the background, the e⁺ and γ may not be back-to-back because the neutrinos carry away some momentum. So the direction correlation would be smeared. So the signal events would have e⁺ and γ in opposite directions with energies summing to the muon mass, while background events would have a broader angular distribution and lower total energy. Therefore, the distinction is based on the total energy and the angular correlation between the two particles.\n</think>\n\n(a) The suppression of the decay $\\mu^+ \\to e^+ + \\gamma$ is due to **lepton flavor conservation**, which is a fundamental principle of the Standard Model. This decay violates lepton flavor number conservation (changing muon flavor to electron flavor), and such processes are highly suppressed in the Standard Model unless mediated by beyond-the-Standard-Model physics.  \n\n(b) The two NaI crystals should be placed **on opposite sides of the stopping target** (180° apart). In the decay $\\mu^+ \\to e^+ + \\gamma$, the positron and photon are emitted back-to-back to conserve momentum. The signal indicating the decay is **coincident detection of two energy deposits** in the crystals:  \n- One crystal measures the total energy of the positron (~52.8 MeV).  \n- The other crystal measures the photon energy (~52.8 MeV).  \nThe sum of these energies equals the muon’s rest mass (~105.7 MeV).  \n\n(c) Background events from $\\mu^+ \\to e^+ + \\nu_e + \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu + \\gamma$ can be distinguished by:  \n1. **Total energy**: The detected $e^+$ and $\\gamma$ energies sum to **less than 105.7 MeV** due to energy carried away by neutrinos.  \n2. **Angular correlation**: The $e^+$ and $\\gamma$ in background events are **not strictly back-to-back** because neutrinos randomize the momentum balance.  \nSignal events have a sharp peak at the total muon mass energy and a tight angular correlation, while background events show a broad energy spectrum and angular distribution.  \n\nFinal Answers:  \n(a) \\[ \\boxed{\\text{Lepton flavor conservation}} \\]  \n(b) \\[ \\boxed{\\text{Crystals placed opposite the target; coincident signals summing to } \\sim 105.7\\ \\text{MeV}} \\]  \n(c) \\[ \\boxed{\\text{Signal events have total energy } \\sim 105.7\\ \\text{MeV and back-to-back angles; background events do not}} \\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Lepton flavor conservation}", "\\text{Crystals placed opposite the target; coincident signals summing to } \\sim 105.7\\ \\text{MeV}", "\\text{Signal events have total energy } \\sim 105.7\\ \\text{MeV and back-to-back angles; background events do not}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Lepton flavor conservation}", "expr2": "\\text{Conservation of electron-lepton and $\\mu$-lepton numbers}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Lepton flavor conservation}", "expr2": "\\text{Place the crystals face to face and perpendicular to the $\\mu$ beam}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Lepton flavor conservation}", "expr2": "E_e + E_{\\gamma} = m_{\\mu} \\ \\text{(for $\\mu^+ \\rightarrow e^+ + \\gamma$)}; \\ (E_e + E_{\\gamma}) < m_{\\mu} \\ \\text{(for $\\mu^+ \\rightarrow e^+ + \\nu_e + \\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu} + \\gamma$)}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Crystals placed opposite the target; coincident signals summing to } \\sim 105.7\\ \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "\\text{Conservation of electron-lepton and $\\mu$-lepton numbers}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Crystals placed opposite the target; coincident signals summing to } \\sim 105.7\\ \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "\\text{Place the crystals face to face and perpendicular to the $\\mu$ beam}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Crystals placed opposite the target; coincident signals summing to } \\sim 105.7\\ \\text{MeV}", "expr2": "E_e + E_{\\gamma} = m_{\\mu} \\ \\text{(for $\\mu^+ \\rightarrow e^+ + \\gamma$)}; \\ (E_e + E_{\\gamma}) < m_{\\mu} \\ \\text{(for $\\mu^+ \\rightarrow e^+ + \\nu_e + \\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu} + \\gamma$)}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Signal events have total energy } \\sim 105.7\\ \\text{MeV and back-to-back angles; background events do not}", "expr2": "\\text{Conservation of electron-lepton and $\\mu$-lepton numbers}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Signal events have total energy } \\sim 105.7\\ \\text{MeV and back-to-back angles; background events do not}", "expr2": "\\text{Place the crystals face to face and perpendicular to the $\\mu$ beam}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Signal events have total energy } \\sim 105.7\\ \\text{MeV and back-to-back angles; background events do not}", "expr2": "E_e + E_{\\gamma} = m_{\\mu} \\ \\text{(for $\\mu^+ \\rightarrow e^+ + \\gamma$)}; \\ (E_e + E_{\\gamma}) < m_{\\mu} \\ \\text{(for $\\mu^+ \\rightarrow e^+ + \\nu_e + \\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu} + \\gamma$)}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.6666666666666666}
{"id": "atomic/3-14", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is about identifying which conservation laws forbid each of the given neutron decay processes. I need to go through each decay one by one and figure out which conservation law is being violated. Let me start by recalling the basic conservation laws in particle physics: conservation of energy, momentum, electric charge, baryon number, lepton number, and maybe others like strangeness, but those might not apply here. Also, for particle decays, things like conservation of angular momentum and parity could come into play, but I think the main ones here are charge, baryon number, lepton number, and maybe lepton family numbers or something else. Let me start with the first decay.\n\nFirst decay: n → p + e⁻. Wait, isn't that the typical beta decay? But wait, beta decay of a neutron is n → p + e⁻ + anti-ν_e, right? So in the given decay, the anti-neutrino is missing. So maybe that's a problem. But the question is about a conservation law that forbids it. So if the anti-neutrino isn't there, which conservation law is violated? Let's check the conservation laws.\n\nCharge: neutron is neutral, proton is +1, electron is -1. Total charge on the right is +1 -1 = 0. But the left side is 0. So charge is conserved. Baryon number: neutron has baryon number +1, proton also +1, electron 0. So left side 1, right side 1 + 0 = 1. Baryon number is conserved. Lepton number: neutron and proton are baryons, so their lepton numbers are 0. The electron is a lepton, so its lepton number is +1. So total lepton number on the right is +1, left is 0. So that's a problem. Lepton number is not conserved. Therefore, the decay n → p + e⁻ is forbidden by conservation of lepton number. But wait, in the actual beta decay, there's an anti-neutrino, which has lepton number -1. So in that case, the total lepton number would be +1 (electron) + (-1) (anti-neutrino) = 0, which matches the left side. So yes, the given decay is missing the anti-neutrino, leading to a lepton number violation. Therefore, the first decay is forbidden by conservation of lepton number.\n\nSecond decay: n → π⁺ + e⁻. Let's check the conservation laws here. Charge: neutron is 0, π⁺ is +1, e⁻ is -1. Total charge on the right is 0. So charge is conserved. Baryon number: neutron has +1, π⁺ is a meson with baryon number 0, electron 0. So total baryon number on the right is 0. Left side is +1. So baryon number is not conserved. Therefore, this decay is forbidden by conservation of baryon number. That seems straightforward. So the second decay violates baryon number conservation.\n\nThird decay: n → p + π⁻. Let's check. Charge: neutron 0, proton +1, π⁻ -1. Total charge on the right is 0. So charge conserved. Baryon number: neutron 1, proton 1, π⁻ 0. Total baryon number on right is 1. So that's okay. Lepton numbers: all particles involved are baryons or mesons, so lepton numbers are 0. So that's okay. What else? Let's check strangeness, but I don't think the neutron or pion have strangeness. Maybe angular momentum or spin? Not sure. Wait, maybe conservation of something else. Let me think. The pion is a spin-0 particle. The neutron and proton are spin-1/2. So the total spin on the right would be spin-1/2 (proton) plus spin-0 (pion) → spin-1/2. The left side is spin-1/2. So spin is conserved. Hmm. What about baryon number? Wait, we already checked that. Baryon number is conserved. Charge is conserved. Lepton numbers are okay. Maybe another quantum number? Let's think about the quark content. Neutron is udd, proton is uud. Pion⁻ is ū d. So the decay would be udd → uud + ū d. Let's see: the neutron (udd) turning into proton (uud) and pion⁻ (ū d). Let's count the quarks. On the left: u, d, d. On the right: u, u, d (from proton) plus anti-u and d (from pion⁻). So total quarks on the right: u, u, d, anti-u, d. Let's combine like terms. For u quarks: 2 (from proton) minus 1 (from anti-u) → net u quarks: 1. For d quarks: 1 (from proton) + 1 (from pion) → 2. Wait, but the neutron has udd, so u:1, d:2. On the right, u: 2 (proton) -1 (anti-u in pion) = 1. d: 1 (proton) +1 (pion) = 2. So quark content seems to balance. But wait, the pion is a meson made of quark-antiquark. So when the neutron decays into proton and pion⁻, the quark composition would require that a d quark in the neutron turns into a u quark in the proton, and the pion⁻ is ū d. So maybe there's a problem with the weak interaction? But wait, pions are usually involved in strong interactions, but decays via the strong force would happen quickly, but the neutron decay is a weak process. Wait, but this decay n → p + π⁻ would involve the strong force? Let me think. The pion is a meson, so if this decay were possible via the strong interaction, it would happen rapidly, but neutrons don't decay that way. So maybe this decay is not possible because of conservation of some other quantum number. Alternatively, maybe the process is not possible because of energy conservation? Let me check the masses. The neutron mass is about 939.57 MeV/c². The proton is about 938.27 MeV/c². The pion⁻ is about 139.57 MeV/c². So the total mass on the right is 938.27 + 139.57 ≈ 1077.84 MeV/c², which is larger than the neutron's mass. Therefore, the decay is not possible because the mass of the products exceeds the mass of the neutron. So energy conservation would forbid it. Wait, but energy conservation is always a thing. If the rest mass of the products is greater than the rest mass of the parent, then the decay is impossible because you can't have that in rest frame. So in that case, the decay n → p + π⁻ is forbidden by conservation of energy. But the question asks for a conservation law, not necessarily energy. Wait, but energy is a conservation law. So maybe that's the answer. But let me confirm. The sum of the rest masses of the products must be less than the rest mass of the decaying particle. Here, neutron's mass is ~939.5 MeV, proton is ~938.3, pion⁻ ~139.6. So 938.3 + 139.6 = 1077.9 MeV, which is way more than 939.5. Therefore, the decay is not possible because it would require the neutron to have more mass than the sum of the products. Wait, no, actually, the rest mass of the parent must be greater than or equal to the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. If the sum is larger, then it's impossible. So in this case, the sum is larger, so energy conservation forbids it. Therefore, the third decay is forbidden by conservation of energy. But wait, the problem says \"state a conservation law that forbids it\". So energy is a valid answer here. Alternatively, maybe there's another conservation law. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe baryon number is conserved here. Wait, neutron (baryon number 1) → proton (1) + pion (0). So total baryon number is 1, which is conserved. Charge is 0 → +1 -1 = 0, so charge is conserved. Lepton numbers are all zero. So the only issue is energy. Therefore, the third decay is forbidden by conservation of energy (mass-energy). But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe angular momentum or something else. But energy seems the main one here.\n\nFourth decay: n → p + γ. Let's check. Charge: neutron 0, proton +1, photon 0. Total charge on the right is +1. So charge isn't conserved. Therefore, this decay is forbidden by conservation of electric charge. Wait, but wait. Let me check again. The neutron is neutral, proton is +1, photon is neutral. So total charge on the right is +1, left is 0. Therefore, charge isn't conserved. So that's the answer. But wait, is there another possibility? Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the photon can't be emitted in this way. But if charge conservation is violated, that's the primary issue. So the fourth decay is forbidden by conservation of electric charge. But wait, wait. Wait, in reality, a neutron can't decay into a proton and a photon because charge isn't conserved. But in beta decay, the neutron emits a W⁻ boson, which then decays into an electron and anti-neutrino. But here, emitting a photon would require a different interaction. Alternatively, maybe there's another conservation law. Let me check the spin. Neutron and proton are spin-1/2, photon is spin-1. So total spin on the right would be 1/2 (proton) + 1 (photon) → possible total spins 1/2 + 1 = 3/2 or 1/2 -1 = -1/2. The left side is spin-1/2. So angular momentum could be conserved. But charge isn't, so that's the main issue. Therefore, the fourth decay is forbidden by conservation of electric charge.\n\nSo summarizing each decay:\n\n1. n → p + e⁻: Lepton number not conserved (since electron has lepton number +1, and no anti-neutrino to balance it).\n2. n → π⁺ + e⁻: Baryon number not conserved (neutron has baryon number 1, products have 0).\n3. n → p + π⁻: Energy conservation (sum of masses exceeds neutron mass).\n4. n → p + γ: Charge conservation (0 → +1 + 0, so total +1 ≠ 0).\n\nWait, but for the fourth decay, the charge is +1 on the right, which doesn't match the left. So charge conservation is violated, which is a clear answer. So each decay is forbidden by a different conservation law. Let me check again each one to make sure.\n\nFirst decay: n → p + e⁻. Charge: 0 → +1 -1 = 0. So charge conserved. Baryon number: 1 → 1 + 0 = 1. Conserved. Lepton number: 0 → 0 + 1 = 1. Not conserved. So yes, lepton number.\n\nSecond decay: n → π⁺ + e⁻. Charge: 0 → +1 -1 = 0. Charge conserved. Baryon number: 1 → 0 + 0 = 0. Not conserved. So baryon number.\n\nThird decay: n → p + π⁻. Charge: 0 → +1 -1 = 0. Conserved. Baryon number: 1 → 1 + 0 = 1. Conserved. Lepton number: 0 → 0 + 0 = 0. Conserved. But the rest mass of products is higher than neutron's mass. So energy conservation.\n\nFourth decay: n → p + γ. Charge: 0 → +1 + 0 = +1. Not conserved. So charge.\n\nYes, that all checks out. So the answers are:\n\n1. Lepton number conservation\n2. Baryon number conservation\n3. Energy conservation\n4. Charge conservation\n\nBut wait, the question says \"state a conservation law that forbids it\". For the third one, energy conservation is correct. But sometimes in particle physics, when a decay is not possible due to insufficient mass, it's considered a kinematic restriction rather than a conservation law. However, conservation of energy is indeed a fundamental conservation law, and if the rest mass energy of the decay products exceeds the parent's rest mass, the decay is impossible because it would violate energy conservation. So that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another conservation law for the third decay. Let me think again. The quark content: neutron (udd) → proton (uud) + π⁻ (d anti-u). Wait, the pion⁻ is d anti-u. So the quark content would be: neutron (u d d) → proton (u u d) + pion⁻ (d ū). Let's see: the proton has u u d. The pion has d and anti-u. So combining, the right side has u, u, d (from proton) and d, ū (from pion). So total quarks: u: 2 (proton) -1 (anti-u in pion) = 1 u. d: 1 (proton) +1 (pion) = 2 d. So quark content matches the neutron (u d d). But how does that happen? The neutron has u d d. The proton has u u d. So to go from neutron to proton, you need to change a d quark to a u quark. That's a weak interaction process, which is what happens in beta decay. But in beta decay, a W⁻ boson is emitted, changing a d quark to a u quark, and then the W⁻ decays into e⁻ and anti-ν_e. But in the decay n → p + π⁻, the pion is made of d and anti-u. So maybe the process would require a d quark turning into a u quark and emitting a pion⁻ (d anti-u). But I'm not sure if that's possible via the strong interaction. Alternatively, maybe the decay is not allowed because of some other conservation law. But I think the main issue here is the energy conservation. Since the sum of the rest masses is higher than the neutron's mass, the decay can't proceed. So energy conservation is the correct answer here.\n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\n1. Conservation of lepton number\n2. Conservation of baryon number\n3. Conservation of energy\n4. Conservation of electric charge\n</think>\n\n- **$n \\rightarrow p + e^-$**  \n  This decay is forbidden by **conservation of lepton number**.

{"id": "atomic/3-13", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these reactions one by one. I need to figure out if each is allowed or forbidden, why if forbidden, and what interaction is involved if allowed. Hmm, let's start with the first one.\n\n1. π⁻ + p → π⁰ + n\n\nAlright, so pion and proton interacting. Let's check the conservation laws. First, charge: π⁻ is -1, proton is +1. Total initial charge is 0. On the right, π⁰ is 0, neutron is 0. So charge is conserved. Baryon number: proton has B=1, neutron also B=1. So initial B is 1 (from proton), final is 1 (from neutron). Baryon number is okay. Strangeness? Pions and nucleons aren't strange, so that's fine. Now, what about other quantum numbers? The reaction could be strong interaction since pions are mesons (strong force carriers). Strong interactions conserve all the quantum numbers. Let me think, is there any reason this can't happen via strong? Maybe isotopic spin? Pions are in an isospin triplet. The proton and neutron are part of the isospin doublet. The reaction π⁻ + p → π⁰ + n: let's see. The initial state has π⁻ (I=1, I3=-1) and proton (I=1/2, I3=+1/2). Combining these, total I could be 1 + 1/2, so possible I=3/2 or 1/2. The final state is π⁰ (I=1, I3=0) and neutron (I=1/2, I3=-1/2). Their total I could be 1 + 1/2, same as initial. So maybe the isospin coupling allows this. So strong interaction allowed. So (a) allowed, (c) strong.\n\n2. π⁰ → γ + γ + γ\n\nHmm, π⁰ decay. Normally, π⁰ decays into two photons. But three photons? Let's think. The decay must conserve angular momentum. The pion is spin 0. Three photons each have spin 1. The total spin would need to combine to 0. But photons are bosons, so symmetric states. However, three photons would have a total angular momentum that's an integer, but can they combine to 0? Maybe, but there's another thing: parity. The pion has parity -1. Each photon has parity -1. So three photons would have total parity (-1)^3 = -1. So parity is conserved here. Wait, but the usual decay is two photons. Why not three? Maybe because of conservation of something else. Wait, the decay into two photons is electromagnetic. For three photons, maybe it's possible but suppressed. Wait, but is there a selection rule? Let me recall. The neutral pion decay to two photons is allowed via electromagnetic interaction because the pion is a pseudoscalar (J^P=0^-). The matrix element for two photons is allowed because their combined polarization can match the pion's quantum numbers. For three photons, the combined parity would be (-1)^3 = -1, which matches the pion's parity. But angular momentum? Each photon has spin 1, but in three photons, their total spin could be 0. However, the matrix element for three photons might be zero due to some symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the decay into three photons is forbidden by some conservation law. Wait, I think that the decay π⁰ → 3γ is forbidden by the Yang theorem, which states that a spin-0 particle cannot decay into three photons. Because the amplitude for three photons would require them to be in a symmetric state under exchange, but due to Bose statistics and the Landau-Yang theorem (which says a spin-1 particle can't decay into two photons), but here spin 0 into three photons. Wait, maybe the Landau-Yang theorem applies to spin 1, but for spin 0, three photons might be possible? Wait, but I remember that the decay π⁰ → 3γ is extremely rare if allowed. But in reality, the main decay is 2γ. So maybe this decay is forbidden. Let me check. The neutral pion's primary decay is indeed two photons. The three-photon decay is possible but highly suppressed. However, in the Standard Model, is it allowed? Let me think about conservation laws. Charge conjugation: the pion is C even. For two photons, each photon is C odd, so two photons give C even. For three photons, C would be odd (since each photon is C=-1, so (-1)^3 = -1). But the pion is C=+1. So C conservation would forbid π⁰ → 3γ. Because the initial state has C=+1, and the final state has C=-1. Therefore, this decay is forbidden by charge conjugation symmetry. So (a) forbidden, (b) violates charge conjugation symmetry.\n\n3. π⁰ → γ + γ\n\nThis is the standard decay. The pion is neutral, spin 0. Two photons: each spin 1. Their spins can combine to total spin 0 (opposite directions). Parity: pion is 0^-, photons each have parity -1. So total parity for two photons is (-1)^2 = +1. Wait, but the pion's parity is -1. Wait, that seems like a problem. Wait, but the pion is a pseudoscalar (0^-). The decay into two photons must conserve parity. How does that work? Hmm, maybe parity is violated here? No, because the interaction is electromagnetic, which conserves parity. Wait, but the pion has intrinsic parity -1. Let me think. The parity of the two-photon system: each photon has intrinsic parity -1. So for two photons, parity is (-1)^2 * (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. But since the pion has spin 0, the two photons must have their spins combined to total spin 0, which requires them to be in opposite directions. The orbital angular momentum L would be 0 (since the pion is spin 0). So the parity of the final state is (+1) * (+1) = +1. But the pion's parity is -1. So this seems like parity isn't conserved. Wait, but the electromagnetic interaction conserves parity. How is this possible? Oh, but the pion is a pseudoscalar meson, and the decay π⁰ → γγ is allowed because the matrix element involves a pseudoscalar coupling, which is parity violating? Wait, no. Wait, the electromagnetic interaction is parity conserving. So how does the pion decay into two photons? Because the interaction is via the chiral anomaly. The decay is allowed because the anomaly allows a process that would otherwise be forbidden by parity conservation. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The standard answer is that π⁰ → γγ is allowed via electromagnetic interaction. The parity argument is resolved because the pion's pseudoscalar nature couples to the electromagnetic field in a way that allows this decay. So even though parity might seem not conserved, the interaction actually allows it. So this decay is allowed, electromagnetic.\n\n4. π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ\n\nPion decay. The typical decay of a charged pion is into a muon and a muon neutrino. Let's check. The pion is spin 0. The muon and neutrino are leptons. The decay must conserve lepton number. The pion is a meson, so no lepton number. The products: μ⁺ has L_mu = +1, and ν_mu has L_mu = +1. Wait, but wait: the antineutrino would have L_mu = -1. Wait, in the decay π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_mu, the neutrino is actually a muon antineutrino. Wait, no. Let me think. The charged pion decay is π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ. Wait, the muon is μ⁺, which is a lepton, and the neutrino must be a muon neutrino or antineutrino. Let's check the lepton numbers. The pion has L_mu = 0. The μ⁺ has L_mu = -1 (since it's the antiparticle). The ν_mu is a neutrino, so L_mu = +1. So total L_mu is -1 +1 = 0. Wait, but the pion has L_mu = 0. So that's conserved. Wait, but the standard decay is π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ. Wait, but ν_μ is the muon neutrino. Wait, but the muon is μ⁺, which is the antiparticle of μ⁻. So when a pion decays, it's into μ⁺ and ν_μ (the antineutrino?), or μ⁺ and ν_mu (neutrino)? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall: the decay π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ is correct. Because in the decay, the quark content of π⁺ is u and anti-d. The decay is via the weak interaction: u and anti-d annihilate into a W⁺ boson, which decays into μ⁺ and ν_μ. Wait, the W⁺ decays into μ⁺ and ν_mu? No, the W⁺ decays into μ⁺ and anti-ν_mu. Because the W⁺ has charge +1. So the decay should produce μ⁺ (charge +1) and anti-ν_mu (charge 0). So the correct products are μ⁺ and anti-ν_mu. Therefore, reaction 4 is π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_mu, which would have a muon neutrino, but actually it should be anti-ν_mu. So if the reaction is written as ν_mu, that's incorrect. Therefore, reaction 4 is forbidden because it violates lepton number. Wait, but the user has reaction 4 as π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_mu. Let's check the lepton numbers. The μ⁺ has L_mu = -1. The ν_mu has L_mu = +1. So total L_mu is (-1) + (+1) = 0. But the initial pion has L_mu = 0. So that's conserved. Wait, but in reality, the decay produces μ⁺ and anti-ν_mu. Because the W⁺ decays to μ⁺ and anti-ν_mu. So the correct decay is π⁺ → μ⁺ + \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu. So reaction 4 is written as π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_mu, which would have L_mu = (-1) + (+1) = 0. But the actual decay has L_mu = (-1) + (-1) = -2? Wait, no. Wait, the anti-ν_mu has L_mu = -1. So μ⁺ (L_mu = -1) and anti-ν_mu (L_mu = -1) would sum to -2. But the pion has L_mu = 0. That can't be. Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let's clarify:\n\nIn the decay π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ:\n\n- The μ⁺ is a lepton with L_mu = -1 (since it's the antiparticle of μ⁻, which has L_mu = +1).\n\n- The ν_μ is a neutrino, which has L_mu = +1.\n\nSo total L_mu is (-1) + (+1) = 0. That's okay. But wait, in reality, the decay produces μ⁺ and anti-ν_mu. Because the W⁺ boson decays into μ⁺ and anti-ν_mu. Let me check the Feynman diagram: the W⁺ couples to μ⁺ and anti-ν_mu. So the correct decay products are μ⁺ and anti-ν_mu. Therefore, reaction 4 (which has ν_mu) is incorrect. The correct decay is reaction 5: π⁺ → μ⁺ + \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu. So reaction 4 is forbidden because it violates lepton number conservation. The actual decay is reaction 5. So for reaction 4: (a) forbidden, (b) violates lepton number conservation. Then reaction 5 is allowed via weak interaction.\n\n5. π⁺ → μ⁺ + \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu\n\nAs above, this is the correct decay. The lepton numbers: μ⁺ has L_mu = -1, \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu has L_mu = -1. Total L_mu = -2. Wait, but the pion has L_mu = 0. That can't be. Wait, no. Wait, the pion is a meson, so it doesn't carry lepton number. The decay products must have total lepton number zero? Wait, no. Lepton number is conserved. The pion has L_mu = 0. The decay products must have L_mu = 0. But μ⁺ has L_mu = -1, and \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu has L_mu = -1. So total L_mu = -2. That's a problem. Wait, this can't be right. I must have made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nThe muon antineutrino (\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu) has L_mu = -1. The muon plus (\\mu⁺) is the antiparticle of the muon minus, so its L_mu is -1. So total L_mu is (-1) + (-1) = -2. But the initial pion has L_mu = 0. That's a violation. So this can't be correct. Wait, this is confusing. Let me check a standard reference. The decay of the charged pion is π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_mu. Wait, but that would mean the neutrino is a muon neutrino. Let's see:\n\nIf the decay is π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_mu, then L_mu for μ⁺ is -1 (since it's the antiparticle), and ν_mu has L_mu = +1. Total L_mu = (-1) + (+1) = 0. That's conserved. But how does that fit with the W⁺ decay? The W⁺ decays to μ⁺ and anti-ν_mu. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the particles. Let me think about the quark content. The pion π⁺ is u + \\bar{d}. The decay via the weak interaction: u → d + W⁺, then W⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_mu. Wait, but the W⁺ decay should produce a positive muon and a neutrino. But the neutrino here would be a ν_mu (particle) or anti-ν_mu? The W⁺ is a boson with charge +1. When it decays into a muon and neutrino, the muon must be positive, and the neutrino must be a muon neutrino (not anti). Because the interaction is: W⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_mu. Because the vertex is W⁺ coupling to μ⁺ and ν_mu. So the ν_mu is a particle, not an antiparticle. Therefore, the decay π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_mu is correct, and lepton numbers are conserved. So reaction 4 is π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_mu, which is allowed. Then reaction 5 is π⁺ → μ⁺ + \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu, which would have L_mu = (-1) + (-1) = -2, violating conservation. Wait, but this contradicts what I thought earlier. Now I'm really confused. Let me check a textbook. According to standard particle physics, the charged pion decays as π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_mu. The ν_mu here is a muon neutrino. The lepton numbers: μ⁺ has L_mu = -1 (since it's the antiparticle), and ν_mu has L_mu = +1. Total L_mu = 0, which matches the pion's L_mu = 0. So reaction 4 is correct and allowed, and reaction 5 is forbidden. Wait, but the user lists reaction 4 as π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_mu and reaction 5 as π⁺ → μ⁺ + \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu. So according to this, reaction 4 is allowed (correct decay) and reaction 5 is forbidden. But earlier I thought reaction 5 was correct. What's the mistake here?\n\nAh, I think the confusion comes from the definition of the neutrino. The W⁺ boson couples to the charged lepton and the corresponding neutrino. So when a W⁺ decays, it produces a positively charged lepton and a neutrino (not an antineutrino). For example, W⁺ → e⁺ + ν_e. Similarly, W⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ. Therefore, the decay π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ is correct. Therefore, reaction 4 is allowed, and reaction 5 (which has \\bar{\\nu}_μ) is forbidden because it would have L_mu = -1 (μ⁺) + (-1) (anti-ν_mu) = -2, which is not conserved. So the answer for reaction 4 is allowed via weak interaction, and reaction 5 is forbidden due to lepton number violation.\n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier thought where I thought reaction 5 was correct. So I need to correct that. So reaction 4 is allowed, reaction 5 is forbidden. Let me confirm with another approach. The pion decay must conserve lepton number. The pion has L_mu = 0. The decay products must have L_mu = 0. For reaction 4: μ⁺ (L_mu = -1) + ν_mu (L_mu = +1) → total 0. Allowed. For reaction 5: μ⁺ (L_mu = -1) + \\bar{\\nu}_mu (L_mu = -1) → total -2. Forbidden. So reaction 4 is allowed, reaction 5 is forbidden. Therefore, the answer for 4 is allowed, weak; 5 is forbidden, violates lepton number.\n\n6. p + \\bar{p} → Λ⁰ + \\bar{Λ}⁰\n\nProton and antiproton annihilate into Lambda and anti-Lambda. Let's check conservation laws. Baryon number: p has B=1, \\bar{p} B=-1. Total B=0. Λ⁰ has B=1, \\bar{Λ}⁰ B=-1. Total B=0. So B is conserved. Charge: p is +1, \\bar{p} -1. Total charge 0. Λ⁰ is neutral, \\bar{Λ}⁰ is neutral. Charge conserved. Strangeness: p and \\bar{p} have S=0. Λ⁰ has S=-1, \\bar{Λ}⁰ S=+1. Total S=0. So strangeness is conserved. Wait, but in strong interactions, strangeness must be conserved. If this reaction is via strong interaction, then it's allowed. But Λ⁰ contains a strange quark. The production of s and \\bar{s} quarks must be considered. The reaction p + \\bar{p} → Λ⁰ + \\bar{Λ}⁰. The proton is uud, antiproton is \\bar{u}\\bar{u}\\bar{d}. Annihilating, maybe creating s and \\bar{s} pairs. Since strangeness is not conserved in strong interactions, but in this reaction, the total strangeness is 0 (Λ⁰ S=-1, \\bar{Λ}⁰ S=+1). So the reaction can proceed via strong interaction because the net strangeness is zero. But wait, in strong interactions, strangeness is conserved. Wait, no: the strong interaction does not conserve strangeness. Wait, no: the strong interaction conserves strangeness. Wait, no, actually, the strong interaction does not conserve strangeness. Wait, the strong interaction is mediated by gluons, which can change quark flavors, but only within the same generation. Wait, no: gluons don't change flavor. So strong interactions conserve flavor. Therefore, to produce s quarks, you need a process that creates s\\bar{s} pairs via the strong force. But creating s quarks would require that the interaction can generate them, which is possible via pair production. So in a strong interaction, you can have s and \\bar{s} created. But the initial particles (p and \\bar{p}) have no s quarks. So the reaction would need to create s and \\bar{s} pairs. But in strong interactions, you can create quark-antiquark pairs, including s. So the reaction p + \\bar{p} → Λ⁰ + \\bar{Λ}⁰ is possible via strong interaction, since the net strangeness is zero (Λ has S=-1, anti-Λ has S=+1). So allowed, strong.\n\n7. p + \\bar{p} → γ\n\nProton and antiproton annihilate into a single photon. Let's check conservation laws. Charge: p is +1, \\bar{p} -1. Total charge 0. Photon has charge 0. Okay. Baryon number: p B=1, \\bar{p} B=-1. Total B=0. Photon B=0. Okay. Angular momentum: photon is spin 1. The initial state is two spin-1/2 particles. Their spins can combine to 0 or 1. The photon has spin 1. So if the initial state has spin 1, then possible. But the photon's spin is 1, and the orbital angular momentum could contribute. However, the problem is that a single photon cannot be produced in a reaction where the initial state has even intrinsic parity. Wait, but more importantly, the reaction p + \\bar{p} → γ violates conservation of angular momentum and possibly other laws. Let's think: the initial state (proton and antiproton) can have total spin 0 or 1. The photon has spin 1. But for a single photon, the total angular momentum must be 1. However, the photon is a vector boson and the reaction must conserve angular momentum. But even if the spins align, the problem is that a single photon cannot satisfy conservation of momentum in the center-of-mass frame. Because in the center-of-mass frame, the initial momentum is zero (particles annihilate at rest), and the photon would have to carry away momentum, but a single photon cannot have zero momentum. Therefore, this reaction is impossible due to momentum conservation. Alternatively, even if they are moving, the emission of a single photon would not conserve momentum. Because in the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum is zero, so the photon would have to have zero momentum, which is impossible. Therefore, this reaction is forbidden. Alternatively, it's forbidden because you can't annihilate baryon and antibaryon into a single photon. The annihilation typically produces multiple particles, like mesons or multiple photons. So (a) forbidden, (b) violates momentum conservation or angular momentum (can't have spin 1 from spin 0 or 1 initial state with a single photon). Wait, but if the initial state has spin 1, then the photon's spin 1 could match. But the main issue is momentum conservation. In the center-of-mass frame, the initial momentum is zero. The photon would have to have zero momentum, which is impossible. Therefore, the reaction is forbidden because it's impossible to have a single photon in the final state when the initial state has zero momentum. So (a) forbidden, (b) momentum conservation. The interaction type would be electromagnetic if allowed, but it's forbidden. So answer: forbidden, momentum conservation, and if allowed, electromagnetic. But since it's forbidden, the reason is momentum conservation.\n</think>\n\n1. **$\\pi^- + p \\rightarrow \\pi^0 + n$**  \n   - (a) Allowed  \n   - (c) Strong interaction  \n   **Reason:** Charge, baryon number, and isospin are conserved.

{"id": "atomic/3-48", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The problem states that a heavy neutrino ν_H decays into a lighter neutrino ν_L and a photon γ. The heavy neutrino is at rest when it decays. We need to show that the resulting photons are monoenergetic and find their energy.\n\nHmm, when a particle at rest decays into two particles, the decay products must have specific energies to conserve both energy and momentum. Since the initial momentum is zero, the momenta of the decay products must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. That usually leads to a fixed energy for each particle, depending on their masses.\n\nLet me recall the conservation laws. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the heavy neutrino, which is m_H c² (assuming c=1 in natural units). After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the light neutrino and the photon. Similarly, the total momentum must be zero, so the momentum of the photon and the light neutrino must cancel each other out.\n\nWait, photons are massless, so their energy is equal to their momentum magnitude times c (again, in natural units, E_γ = |p_γ|). The light neutrino has mass m_L, so its energy is sqrt(p_L² + m_L²). Since the heavy neutrino is at rest, the momenta of the decay products must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So |p_ν| = |p_γ|, but they point in opposite directions. Let's denote the magnitude of the momentum as p.\n\nSo, energy conservation gives:\n\nm_H = E_ν + E_γ\n\nBut E_ν = sqrt(p² + m_L²) and E_γ = p (since photon is massless). Therefore:\n\nm_H = sqrt(p² + m_L²) + p\n\nWe can solve this equation for p. Let's rearrange:\n\nsqrt(p² + m_L²) = m_H - p\n\nSquare both sides:\n\np² + m_L² = (m_H - p)² = m_H² - 2 m_H p + p²\n\nSubtract p² from both sides:\n\nm_L² = m_H² - 2 m_H p\n\nThen solve for p:\n\n2 m_H p = m_H² - m_L²\n\np = (m_H² - m_L²)/(2 m_H)\n\nSo the momentum of the photon is p = (m_H² - m_L²)/(2 m_H). Then the energy of the photon is E_γ = p = (m_H² - m_L²)/(2 m_H). Since this is a fixed value depending only on the masses, the photons are monoenergetic with this energy. Therefore, part (a) is solved. The energy is (m_H² - m_L²)/(2 m_H).\n\nMoving to part (b), we need to evaluate this expression in the limit where m_L is much smaller than m_H. If m_L << m_H, then m_L² is negligible compared to m_H². So the energy becomes approximately (m_H²)/(2 m_H) = m_H/2. So the photon energy is roughly half the mass of the heavy neutrino. If the heavy neutrino mass is 50 eV, then the photon energy would be about 25 eV. \n\nNow, 25 eV corresponds to what part of the spectrum? Let me recall the electromagnetic spectrum. Visible light is around 1-3 eV. Ultraviolet is higher, maybe up to 100 eV. Then soft X-rays start around 100 eV. Wait, 25 eV is in the extreme ultraviolet or maybe soft X-ray range? Let me check. The energy in electron volts can be converted to wavelength using E = hc/λ. hc is approximately 1240 eV·nm. So λ = 1240 nm·eV / E. For 25 eV, λ = 1240 /25 ≈ 49.6 nm. 50 nm is in the extreme ultraviolet range. So the photons would be in the extreme ultraviolet or soft X-ray? Wait, X-rays are typically shorter than 10 nm. So 50 nm is definitely in the ultraviolet, specifically extreme ultraviolet (EUV). So the spectral regime would be extreme ultraviolet.\n\nFor part (c), if the lifetime of the heavy neutrinos is short compared to the age of the universe, but they were still cold (at rest) when they decayed, how does this affect the answer in part (b)? Well, in part (b), we assumed that the neutrinos decay now when they are cold. If their lifetime is shorter, they would have decayed much earlier in the universe's history. However, the problem states that even though the lifetime is short, they were still cold (at rest) at the time of decay. So the decay process itself is the same as before—since the neutrino is at rest, the photon energy would still be the same, (m_H² - m_L²)/(2 m_H), which in the limit m_L << m_H is m_H/2. Therefore, the photon energy would still be 25 eV. Wait, but maybe there's a cosmological redshift effect? If the neutrinos decayed earlier, the photons would have been emitted at an earlier time when the universe was smaller, and thus their wavelengths would be stretched due to the expansion of the universe. So the observed photon energy today would be lower than the emitted energy. The problem says \"how would this change your answer to part (b) qualitatively?\" So if the decay happens earlier, the photon's energy today would be redshifted. Therefore, instead of observing photons at 25 eV, we would observe them at a lower energy, depending on the redshift factor. The spectral regime would shift to lower energies (longer wavelengths). So instead of looking in the extreme ultraviolet, we might need to look in the far ultraviolet or even optical range, depending on how much redshift occurred. But the problem says to answer qualitatively, so the answer is that the photon energy would be redshifted, so the spectral regime would be lower energy (longer wavelength) than in part (b).\n</think>\n\n(a) To determine the photon energy from the decay of a stationary heavy neutrino $\\nu_H$, we apply conservation of energy and momentum. The initial energy is $m_H$ (in natural units), and the final energies of the photon and light neutrino are $E_\\gamma = p$ and $E_{\\nu_L} = \\sqrt{p^2 + m_L^2}$, respectively. Momentum conservation requires $p_{\\nu_L} = p_\\gamma = p$. Solving the energy conservation equation:\n\n\\[\nm_H = \\sqrt{p^2 + m_L^2} + p,\n\\]\n\nwe square both sides and simplify to find:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{m_H^2 - m_L^2}{2m_H}.\n\\]\n\nThe photon energy is thus:\n\n\\[\nE_\\gamma = \\frac{m_H^2 - m_L^2}{2m_H}.\n\\]\n\nSince this energy depends only on the fixed masses $m_H$ and $m_L$, the photons are monoenergetic.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{E_\\gamma = \\frac{m_H^2 - m_L^2}{2m_H}}\n\\]\n\n(b) In the limit $m_L \\ll m_H$, the photon energy simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nE_\\gamma \\approx \\frac{m_H}{2}.\n\\]\n\nFor $m_H = 50\\ \\text{eV}$, $E_\\gamma \\approx 25\\ \\text{eV}$.

{"id": "atomic/3-41", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking about neutrinos and antineutrinos, their general properties, the motivation for postulating their existence, and how they were first detected. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the properties of neutrinos. Neutrinos are elementary particles, part of the lepton family. They have very little mass, maybe even nearly massless, but I remember that recent experiments show they do have a tiny mass. They interact via the weak force and gravity, so they don't participate in strong or electromagnetic interactions. That's why they're so hard to detect. They come in different flavors: electron, muon, and tau neutrinos, each associated with their respective charged leptons. Also, they have corresponding antineutrinos. Neutrinos are neutral, so their antiparticles might have opposite lepton number or other quantum numbers. Oh, right, neutrinos have half-integer spin, so they're fermions. They travel at speeds close to the speed of light. Since they interact weakly, they can pass through matter almost undisturbed, which explains why they're so elusive.\n\nNow, the original motivation for their existence. I think this goes back to beta decay experiments. In the early 20th century, when studying beta decay, there was a problem with conservation of energy and momentum. The emitted electrons had a continuous spectrum of energies, which shouldn't happen if the decay was a two-body process (like nucleus decaying into another nucleus and an electron). If energy and momentum weren't conserved, that would be a big issue, but Pauli proposed a solution by suggesting another particle was involved, which carried away the missing energy and momentum. That particle was the neutrino, though it wasn't detected until much later. So the main motivation was to preserve conservation laws in beta decay.\n\nAs for the first direct detection, I remember that neutrinos were first detected in the 1950s by Cowan and Reines. They used a nuclear reactor as a source of antineutrinos (since reactors produce beta decays, which emit antineutrinos). The experiment involved a large tank of water with detectors. The antineutrinos would interact with protons in the water, producing neutrons and positrons. The positrons would annihilate with electrons, producing gamma rays, and the neutrons would be captured by nuclei, emitting delayed gamma rays. The coincidence of these two signals would confirm the neutrino interaction. This was the famous Cowan-Reines experiment, which successfully detected neutrinos, confirming their existence.\n\nWait, but neutrinos vs antineutrinos. In beta decay, when a neutron decays into a proton, electron, and antineutrino. So the emitted particle is an antineutrino. So the experiment detected antineutrinos. But the question asks about both neutrinos and antineutrinos. Their properties would be similar except for some quantum numbers like lepton number. For example, a neutrino has a lepton number of +1, and an antineutrino -1. Also, in interactions, they produce different particles. For instance, a neutrino interacting with a neutron would produce a proton and a muon, whereas an antineutrino might produce a positron and a neutron, depending on the interaction.\n\nAnother property: neutrinos are affected by the weak force's chirality. They are left-handed in the Standard Model, meaning their spin is opposite to their direction of motion. Antineutrinos are right-handed. But I think this is part of their properties. Also, they can oscillate between flavors, which was discovered later, but maybe that's beyond the original question.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nProperties of neutrinos and antineutrinos:\n- Elementary leptons, neutral (no electric charge)\n- Very small mass (but non-zero)\n- Interact via weak interaction and gravity\n- Three flavors: electron, muon, tau (and their antineutrinos)\n- Fermions (spin 1/2)\n- Neutrinos are left-handed, antineutrinos right-handed (helicity)\n- Lepton number: +1 for neutrinos, -1 for antineutrinos\n- Extremely weak interaction, high penetration through matter\n\nOriginal motivation: To resolve the apparent violation of energy and momentum conservation in beta decay by introducing a neutral particle (neutrino) that carries away the missing energy and momentum.\n\nFirst direct detection: The Cowan-Reines experiment in 1956 using a nuclear reactor's antineutrinos interacting in a detector to produce positrons and neutrons, detected via gamma-ray signals.\n\nI need to make sure the detection part is correct. The reaction they used was inverse beta decay: antineutrino + proton → neutron + positron. The positron annihilates to produce two 511 keV gamma rays, and the neutron is captured by a cadmium nucleus, emitting a gamma ray after a delay. The delayed coincidence confirmed the detection.\n</think>\n\n**General Properties of Neutrinos and Antineutrinos:**  \n1. **Elementary particles**: Belong to the lepton family; no substructure.  \n2. **Electric charge**: Neutral (no charge).  \n3. **Mass**: Extremely small but non-zero (confirmed via neutrino oscillations).  \n4. **Interaction**: Only via the weak nuclear force and gravity; negligible electromagnetic/strong interaction.  \n5. **Flavors**: Three types—electron (\\( \\nu_e \\)), muon (\\( \\nu_\\mu \\)), tau (\\( \\nu_\\tau \\))—and their antineutrinos (\\( \\bar{\\nu}_e, \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu, \\bar{\\nu}_\\tau \\)).  \n6. **Spin**: Fermions with spin-\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).  \n7. **Helicity**: Neutrinos are predominantly left-handed (spin opposite to motion); antineutrinos are right-handed.  \n8. **Lepton number**: Neutrinos have \\( +1 \\), antineutrinos \\( -1 \\).  \n9. **Penetration**: Interact so weakly they can traverse entire planets unimpeded.  \n\n**Physical Motivation for Postulating Neutrinos:**  \nIn the 1930s, beta decay experiments showed a continuous energy spectrum for emitted electrons, seemingly violating energy and momentum conservation. Wolfgang Pauli proposed a neutral, undetected particle (later named the neutrino by Enrico Fermi) to carry away the \"missing\" energy and momentum, preserving these conservation laws.  \n\n**First Direct Detection:**  \nThe **Cowan-Reines experiment (1956)** confirmed neutrinos using antineutrinos from a nuclear reactor. The reaction \\( \\bar{\\nu}_e + p \\rightarrow n + e^+ \\) (inverse beta decay) produced detectable signals:  \n- **Prompt signal**: Positron annihilation (\\( e^+ + e^- \\rightarrow 2\\gamma \\), 511 keV each).  \n- **Delayed signal**: Neutron capture by cadmium (\\( n + \\text{Cd} \\rightarrow \\gamma \\)-rays after ~5 μs).  \nObserving these coincident signals confirmed antineutrino interactions.  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Neutrino properties: neutral, near-massless, weak-interacting, three flavors, fermionic.} \\\\\n&\\text{Motivation: Resolve energy/momentum conservation in beta decay.} \\\\\n&\\text{Detection: Cowan-Reines experiment (1956) via inverse beta decay.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Neutrino properties: neutral, near-massless, weak-interacting, three flavors, fermionic.} \\\\\n&\\text{Motivation: Resolve energy/momentum conservation in beta decay.} \\\\\n&\\text{Detection: Cowan-Reines experiment (1956) via inverse beta decay.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Neutrino properties: neutral, near-massless, weak-interacting, three flavors, fermionic.} \\\\\n&\\text{Motivation: Resolve energy/momentum conservation in beta decay.} \\\\\n&\\text{Detection: Cowan-Reines experiment (1956) via inverse beta decay.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{Leptons, weakly interacting, \\{electron, muon, tau\\}-neutrinos and their antiparticles}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Neutrino properties: neutral, near-massless, weak-interacting, three flavors, fermionic.} \\\\\n&\\text{Motivation: Resolve energy/momentum conservation in beta decay.} \\\\\n&\\text{Detection: Cowan-Reines experiment (1956) via inverse beta decay.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{Resolve energy conflict in $\\beta$-decay}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/3-46", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about determining the length of a neutrino detector required so that 1 out of 10^6 neutrinos with energy 1000 GeV interacts. The given parameters are the density ρ ≈ 5 g/cm³, average atomic mass ⟨A⟩ = 20. The cross section rises linearly with Eν. The options are in kilometers, meters, and meters, so the answer is probably in the range of meters to kilometers. Let me recall the formula for neutrino interaction probability.\n\nThe interaction probability P for a neutrino is given by P = N * σ * L, where N is the number of target nuclei per unit area, σ is the cross section, and L is the length of the detector. But wait, actually, the formula is P = n * σ * L, where n is the number of target nuclei per unit volume, multiplied by the length gives the column density (per unit area). So n is the number density.\n\nFirst, let's compute n. The number density n can be calculated using the density ρ, Avogadro's number, and the average atomic mass ⟨A⟩. The formula is n = (ρ * N_A) / ⟨A⟩, where N_A is Avogadro's number (6.022e23 mol⁻¹). But we need to make sure the units are consistent. The density is given in g/cm³, so let's convert that to kg/m³ for SI units. Wait, maybe it's easier to work in cm since the density is given in g/cm³. Let's see:\n\nρ = 5 g/cm³. Since 1 mole of a substance with atomic mass A grams is A grams per mole. So, the number of moles per cm³ is (5 g/cm³) / (⟨A⟩ g/mol) ) = 5 / 20 mol/cm³ = 0.25 mol/cm³. Then, multiplying by Avogadro's number gives the number of nuclei per cm³: 0.25 mol/cm³ * 6.022e23 nuclei/mol = 1.5055e23 nuclei/cm³. So n = 1.5055e23 cm⁻³. But we need to convert this to per meter or per centimeter? Let's see. If we keep it in cm, then n is 1.5055e23 cm⁻³. But cross sections are usually in cm² or barns (1 barn = 1e-24 cm²). Let me check the units.\n\nThe cross section σ is in cm². The product n * σ * L (where L is in cm) would then be (cm⁻³) * (cm²) * (cm) = cm⁻³ * cm³ = dimensionless, which is correct for probability. So the formula is P = n * σ * L.\n\nWe need P = 1e-6 (since 1 out of 1e6 interacts). So L = P / (n * σ).\n\nNow, we need to find σ for a neutrino with Eν = 1000 GeV. The problem states that the cross section rises linearly with Eν. But to compute σ, we need to know the cross section at a certain energy. Wait, but the problem doesn't give a specific value for the cross section. Hmm. Maybe we need to recall typical neutrino cross sections.\n\nWait, neutrinos have very small cross sections. At around 1 GeV, the cross section is roughly 1e-38 cm². But since the cross section is linear with energy, at 1000 GeV (1 TeV), the cross section would be 1e-38 cm² * 1000 = 1e-35 cm². But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Let me think. I remember that for neutrino cross sections, at around 1 GeV, it's about 1e-38 cm², and it scales linearly with energy. So at Eν = 1 TeV = 1000 GeV, σ ≈ 1e-38 * 1000 = 1e-35 cm². Is that correct? Alternatively, maybe the cross section scales as σ ≈ 1e-45 cm² * Eν (in GeV). So for Eν = 1000 GeV, σ ≈ 1e-45 * 1000 = 1e-42 cm². Wait, that seems too small. Wait, maybe I need to check some references. But since I can't do that, I need to recall.\n\nWait, another approach. The cross section for neutrino interactions is approximately σ ≈ 1e-43 cm² * (Eν/10 GeV). So for Eν = 10 GeV, σ ≈ 1e-43 * 1 = 1e-43 cm². But that seems too low. Wait, maybe I'm mixing different interactions. Let me think again. For charged current interactions, the cross section for ν_e is roughly σ ≈ 1e-38 cm² at 1 GeV. So scaling linearly, at 1000 GeV, it would be 1e-38 * 1000 = 1e-35 cm². That seems plausible. Let's go with that for now.\n\nSo σ ≈ 1e-35 cm².\n\nNow, plugging into the formula:\n\nL = P / (n * σ) = 1e-6 / (1.5055e23 cm⁻³ * 1e-35 cm²)\n\nFirst, compute the denominator: 1.5055e23 * 1e-35 = 1.5055e-12 cm⁻¹.\n\nThen, L = 1e-6 / 1.5055e-12 cm⁻¹ = (1 / 1.5055e-12) * 1e-6 cm = (1e6 / 1.5055e-12) cm. Wait, no: 1e-6 divided by 1.5055e-12 is (1e-6) / (1.5055e-12) = (1 / 1.5055) * 1e6 = approximately 0.664 * 1e6 = 6.64e5 cm.\n\nConvert cm to meters: 6.64e5 cm = 6.64e3 meters = 6640 meters. But the options are 6 km, 480 m, 5 m. 6640 meters is 6.64 km, which is close to option (a) 6 km. But wait, maybe my cross section estimate is off. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross section scaling is different. Let's think again. The problem says the cross section rises linearly with Eν. So if at some energy E0, the cross section is σ0, then at Eν = 1000 GeV, σ = σ0 * (Eν / E0). But without knowing σ0, we can't proceed. Wait, but maybe there's a standard cross section value that I should know. For example, the cross section for neutrinos at around 1 GeV is about 1e-38 cm². If that's the case, then at 1000 GeV, it's 1e-38 * 1000 = 1e-35 cm². Then, proceeding as before, L ≈ 6.64e5 cm = 6640 m ≈ 6.6 km. So option (a) 6 km is the closest. But the given options have (a) 6 km, (b) 480 m, (c) 5 m. So 6 km is an option. But maybe my cross section assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross section scales as σ ≈ 1e-45 cm² * Eν (in GeV). So for Eν = 1000 GeV, σ = 1e-45 * 1000 = 1e-42 cm². Then, denominator n*σ = 1.5e23 * 1e-42 = 1.5e-19 cm⁻¹. Then L = 1e-6 / 1.5e-19 = ~6.66e12 cm = 6.66e10 meters, which is way too big. So that can't be right. So my initial assumption of σ ≈ 1e-35 cm² must be correct.\n\nBut wait, another way: Maybe the cross section is given by σ = 1e-38 cm² * (Eν / 1 GeV). So at 1000 GeV, σ = 1e-38 * 1000 = 1e-35 cm². Then, same as before. So L ≈ 6.6e5 cm = 6.6 km. So answer (a). But the options have (a) 6 km. But maybe the actual cross section is different. Let me check if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross section is given by σ = 1e-36 cm² * (Eν / 1 GeV). Then at 1000 GeV, σ = 1e-36 * 1000 = 1e-33 cm². Then denominator n*σ = 1.5e23 * 1e-33 = 1.5e-10 cm⁻¹. Then L = 1e-6 / 1.5e-10 = ~6.66e3 cm = 66.6 meters. That's not matching any options. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross section is 1e-40 cm² at 1 GeV, scaling linearly. Then at 1000 GeV, σ = 1e-40 * 1000 = 1e-37 cm². Then denominator n*σ = 1.5e23 * 1e-37 = 1.5e-14 cm⁻¹. L = 1e-6 / 1.5e-14 = ~6.66e7 cm = 6.66e5 meters = 666 km. That's way too big. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the formula for interaction probability more carefully. The formula is P = N_target * σ, where N_target is the number of target nuclei per unit area. Wait, no, the total number of targets is n * L * A, where A is the area? Wait, no. The probability is given by P = N * σ, where N is the column density (number of targets per area). Wait, maybe I'm confusing flux with cross section. Let me recall: The probability that a neutrino interacts in a detector is P = n * σ * L, where n is number per volume, L is length, so n*L is number per area. So yes, P = n * σ * L.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake in calculating n. Let's recalculate n. The density is ρ = 5 g/cm³. The average atomic mass is ⟨A⟩ = 20. So the number of moles per cm³ is (5 g/cm³) / (20 g/mol) ) = 0.25 mol/cm³. Then, number of nuclei per cm³ is 0.25 * Avogadro's number ≈ 0.25 * 6.022e23 = 1.5055e23 cm⁻³. So n = 1.5055e23 cm⁻³. Correct.\n\nSo if σ is 1e-35 cm², then n*σ = 1.5055e23 * 1e-35 = 1.5055e-12 cm⁻¹. Then L = P / (n*σ) = 1e-6 / 1.5055e-12 ≈ 6.64e5 cm = 6.64e3 meters = 6.64 km. So answer (a) 6 km.\n\nBut the options have (a) 6 km, which is close. But maybe the cross section is slightly different. For example, if the cross section at 1 GeV is 1e-38 cm², then at 1000 GeV, it's 1e-35 cm². But maybe the actual cross section is higher. Let me check some references in my mind. Wait, I recall that the cross section for neutrinos at around 1 TeV (1000 GeV) is approximately 1e-35 cm². For example, from some particle physics notes, the cross section scales as σ ≈ 1e-38 cm² * (Eν / 1 GeV). So yes, that would give 1e-35 cm² at 1 TeV. So then the calculation is correct, leading to ~6.6 km. So answer (a) 6 km.\n\nBut wait, the options are (a) 6 km, (b) 480 m, (c) 5 m. So why is there such a big discrepancy? Maybe I made a mistake in units. Let me check the units again.\n\nWait, n is in cm⁻³, σ in cm², L in cm. So n*σ*L is (cm⁻³)(cm²)(cm) = cm⁻³ * cm³ = dimensionless. Correct. So the calculation is correct. But 6.64 km is option (a). But maybe the cross section is different. Let me think again. Maybe the cross section for neutrinos at high energy is higher. Wait, another thought: Neutrino cross sections at high energies (TeV scale) are actually higher than 1e-35 cm². For example, from some data, the cross section for neutrinos at 1 TeV is around 1e-33 cm². Wait, if that's the case, then σ = 1e-33 cm². Then n*σ = 1.5e23 * 1e-33 = 1.5e-10 cm⁻¹. Then L = 1e-6 / 1.5e-10 ≈ 6.66e3 cm = 66.6 meters. That's closer to option (b) 480 m. Hmm, not quite. Wait, 66 meters is not 480 meters. So maybe my cross section assumption is still off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross section scales as Eν in some other way. Wait, the problem says \"the cross section rises linearly with Eν\". So if the cross section is proportional to Eν, then σ = k * Eν. But without knowing the constant k, we can't proceed. But maybe we can use the given answer options to infer the correct cross section. Let's try that.\n\nSuppose the correct answer is (b) 480 m. Let's see what cross section would lead to that. L = 480 m = 4.8e4 cm. Then, solving for σ: σ = P / (n * L) = 1e-6 / (1.5055e23 cm⁻³ * 4.8e4 cm) = 1e-6 / (7.2264e27 cm⁻²) ≈ 1.38e-34 cm². So σ ≈ 1.38e-34 cm². If that's the cross section at 1000 GeV, then the cross section scaling would be σ = 1.38e-34 cm² at 1000 GeV. If we assume that at 1 GeV, σ = 1.38e-34 / 1000 = 1.38e-37 cm². But I thought the cross section at 1 GeV is around 1e-38 cm². So this would be an order of magnitude higher. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the answer is (c) 5 m, then L = 500 cm. Then σ = 1e-6 / (1.5055e23 * 500) = 1e-6 / 7.5275e25 ≈ 1.33e-32 cm². That would imply a cross section of 1.33e-32 cm² at 1000 GeV, which would mean at 1 GeV, σ = 1.33e-35 cm². But that's higher than typical values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me recheck the calculation with σ = 1e-35 cm²:\n\nn = 1.5055e23 cm⁻³\n\nσ = 1e-35 cm²\n\nn*σ = 1.5055e23 * 1e-35 = 1.5055e-12 cm⁻¹\n\nL = P / (n*σ) = 1e-6 / 1.5055e-12 ≈ 6.64e5 cm = 6.64e3 meters = 6.64 km. So answer (a).\n\nBut the problem states that the cross section rises linearly with Eν. Maybe the cross section is given by σ = Eν * some constant. But without knowing the constant, how can we proceed? Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to use a standard cross section value. For example, the typical cross section for neutrinos at 1 GeV is about 1e-38 cm², and since it scales linearly with energy, at 1000 GeV, it's 1e-35 cm². Then the calculation leads to ~6.6 km, which is option (a). But maybe the actual cross section used in the problem is different. Let me think if there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses the formula for the interaction length. The interaction length L_int is 1/(nσ), and the probability P = L / L_int. So P = nσL. So L = P/(nσ). Same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses the concept of radiation length or something similar, but I don't think so. It's about neutrino interaction cross sections.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the average atomic mass ⟨A⟩ is 20, so the molar mass is 20 g/mol. The number of moles per cm³ is density / molar mass = 5 g/cm³ / 20 g/mol = 0.25 mol/cm³. Then number of nuclei per cm³ is 0.25 * Avogadro's number ≈ 1.505e23 cm⁻³. Correct.\n\nSo, if the cross section is 1e-35 cm², then L = 1e-6 / (1.505e23 * 1e-35) ≈ 1e-6 / 1.505e-12 ≈ 6.64e5 cm = 6.64 km. So answer (a). But the options have (a) 6 km, which is close. So the correct answer should be (a).\n\nBut why is there an option (b) 480 m? Maybe I made a mistake in the cross section value. Let me check another source in my mind. Wait, I recall that the neutrino cross section at around 1 TeV is approximately 1e-33 cm². For example, from some high-energy neutrino experiments, like IceCube, the cross section at PeV energies is around 1e-31 cm². But 1 TeV is 0.001 PeV. So scaling down, maybe 1e-33 cm² at 1 TeV. If that's the case, then σ = 1e-33 cm². Then n*σ = 1.5e23 * 1e-33 = 1.5e-10 cm⁻¹. Then L = 1e-6 / 1.5e-10 ≈ 6.66e3 cm = 66.6 meters. That's closer to option (b) 480 m? No, 66 meters is 0.066 km, which is 66 meters, but option (b) is 480 meters. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross section is 1e-34 cm². Then n*σ = 1.5e23 * 1e-34 = 1.5e-11 cm⁻¹. L = 1e-6 / 1.5e-11 ≈ 6.66e4 cm = 666 meters. That's closer to option (b) 480 m. But still not exact. Maybe the cross section is 3e-34 cm². Then n*σ = 1.5e23 * 3e-34 = 4.5e-11 cm⁻¹. L = 1e-6 / 4.5e-11 ≈ 2.22e4 cm = 222 meters. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross section is 2.2e-34 cm². Then n*σ = 1.5e23 * 2.2e-34 = 3.3e-11 cm⁻¹. L = 1e-6 / 3.3e-11 ≈ 3e4 cm = 300 meters. Still not 480.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross section is calculated differently. Let's think about the formula for the cross section. The cross section for neutrino-nucleus interactions can be approximated by σ ≈ G_F² Eν² ⟨A⟩ / π, where G_F is the Fermi constant. But I'm not sure. Wait, the cross section for neutrino-nucleon scattering is σ ≈ G_F² Eν² / π. For a nucleus with A nucleons, the cross section would scale with A, so σ ≈ G_F² Eν² A / π. But this is a rough approximation.\n\nFermi constant G_F = 1.166e-5 GeV⁻². Let's compute σ in cm². First, convert GeV to appropriate units. 1 GeV = 1.602e-3 erg (since 1 eV = 1.602e-12 erg, so 1 GeV = 1e9 eV = 1.602e-3 erg). But cross section units are cm². Let's use natural units where c=1, ħ=1. Then 1 GeV⁻² ≈ (1.973e-14 cm)² ≈ 3.89e-28 cm². So G_F in cm² is G_F = 1.166e-5 GeV⁻² * 3.89e-28 cm²/GeV⁻² ≈ 4.53e-33 cm².\n\nThen σ ≈ G_F² Eν² A / π. Plugging in G_F = 1.166e-5 GeV⁻², Eν = 1000 GeV, A = 20.\n\nBut wait, in natural units (GeV), G_F is in GeV⁻², Eν in GeV, so σ would be in GeV⁻4. To convert to cm², multiply by (ħc)^2 ≈ (197.3 MeV fm)^2. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to compute it step by step.\n\nThe cross section formula for neutrino-nucleus scattering (coherent) is σ = (G_F² Eν² A²)/(4π) * something. But I might be mixing different formulas. Alternatively, for neutral current interactions, the cross section per nucleon is σ ≈ 1e-38 cm² * (Eν/GeV). So for Eν = 1000 GeV, σ per nucleon = 1e-38 * 1000 = 1e-35 cm². Then for a nucleus with A=20, the total cross section would be 20 * 1e-35 = 2e-34 cm². Then using this σ:\n\nn = 1.5e23 cm⁻³ (number of nuclei per cm³)\n\nσ = 2e-34 cm²\n\nn*σ = 1.5e23 * 2e-34 = 3e-11 cm⁻¹\n\nL = 1e-6 / 3e-11 ≈ 3.33e4 cm = 333 meters. Closer to option (b) 480 m, but still not exact. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the cross section per nucleus is 1e-35 cm² (as before), then with A=20, maybe the cross section scales with A, so σ = 1e-35 * 20 = 2e-34 cm². Then same as above, leading to 333 meters. Still not 480.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross section scales with A^(1/3) for coherent scattering. But I'm not sure. This is getting too complicated. Maybe the initial approach was correct, and the answer is (a) 6 km. But why is there such a big discrepancy with the other options?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the density is given in g/cm³, and I need to convert it to kg/m³. Wait, no, because we used the density in g/cm³ directly with the molar mass in g/mol. So that part is correct. For example, 5 g/cm³ divided by 20 g/mol gives 0.25 mol/cm³, which is correct.\n\nWait, another possible mistake: Did I use the number of nuclei per cm³ correctly? Yes, because density divided by molar mass gives moles per cm³, multiplied by Avogadro's number gives nuclei per cm³. Correct.\n\nSo unless there's a mistake in the cross section value, the answer should be (a) 6 km. But given that the options include 480 m, which is an order of magnitude less, maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me check the calculation again:\n\nn = 1.5055e23 cm⁻³\n\nσ = 1e-35 cm²\n\nn*σ = 1.5055e23 * 1e-35 = 1.5055e-12 cm⁻¹\n\nL = 1e-6 / 1.5055e-12 = 1e-6 / 1.5055e-12 ≈ 664,000 cm = 6,640 meters = 6.64 km. Yes, that's correct. So answer (a).\n\nBut the problem states that the cross section rises linearly with Eν. If the cross section at 1 GeV is 1e-38, then at 1000 GeV it's 1e-35. So the calculation holds. Therefore, the correct answer is (a) 6 km.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the required detector length for 1 out of \\(10^6\\) neutrinos to interact, we use the interaction probability formula \\(P = n \\sigma L\\), where \\(n\\) is the number density of target nuclei, \\(\\sigma\\) is the neutrino cross section, and \\(L\\) is the detector length. \n\n1. **Calculate \\(n\\):**\n   - Density \\(\\rho = 5 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3\\), \\(\\langle A \\rangle = 20\\)\n   - Moles per cm³: \\(\\frac{\\rho}{\\langle A \\rangle} = \\frac{5}{20} = 0.25 \\, \\text{mol/cm}^3\\)\n   - Number density \\(n = 0.25 \\times 6.022 \\times 10^{23} = 1.5055 \\times 10^{23} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3}\\)\n\n2. **Cross section \\(\\sigma\\):**\n   - Cross section scales linearly with \\(E_\\nu\\).

{"id": "atomic/3-12", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a non-trivial decay mode (with a rate greater than 5%) for each of the listed particles. I need to make sure each decay is possible and the branching ratio is above 5%. Also, if neutrinos are involved, specify their type. Let me go through each particle one by one.\n\nStarting with the neutron (n). Neutrons are unstable when free, right? Their decay is beta decay. The typical decay is n → p + e⁻ + ν̄_e. The branching ratio for this is almost 100%, so that's definitely over 5%.\n\nNext, the π⁺ (positive pion). The main decay mode for π⁺ is into a muon and a muon neutrino. So π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ. The branching ratio is like 99.9877%, which is way above 5%. There's also a small chance to decay to e⁺ + ν_e, but that's suppressed, so the main one is the muon channel.\n\nThen the ρ⁰ (rho zero meson). The rho meson is a vector meson, and it's unstable. The dominant decay is into two pions: ρ⁰ → π⁺ + π⁻. The branching ratio here is about 100%, so that's straightforward.\n\nK⁰ (K-zero). Wait, K⁰ can be K_S or K_L depending on the state. But the question just says K⁰. Hmm. The neutral kaons have different decay modes. The K_L (long) and K_S (short) have different dominant decays. But since the question is K⁰, maybe I should consider the charged pion decays. Wait, K⁰ (which is a mixture of K_S and K_L) but perhaps the main decay modes. For K_S, the main decay is π⁺ π⁻, and for K_L, it's three pions. But the problem might be expecting the charged pion decay. Wait, but K⁰ can decay via the weak interaction. Let me check. The K⁰ (which is the neutral kaon) can have decay modes like π⁺ + π⁻ or π⁰ π⁰ for the K_S component, and three pions for K_L. But the problem says \"K⁰\", which is a combination. However, the dominant decay modes for K_S (which is a part of K⁰) is two pions with a branching ratio around 69%, and K_L decays into three pions with about 20% for π⁺ π⁻ π⁰. Wait, but maybe the question is referring to the K⁰_S or K⁰_L? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer expects the K⁰_L → π± e∓ ν_e (semileptonic decay) but that's about 40% for K⁰_L. Wait, but the problem says \"K⁰\", which is ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the answer is K⁰_S → π⁺ π⁻ (with ~69% branching ratio) or K⁰_L → π⁺ π⁻ π⁰ (with ~12.5% branching ratio). Wait, but the problem says \"non-trivial (rate greater than 5%)\". So for K⁰_S, the two-pion decay is 69%, which is over 5%. But K⁰_L's three-pion decay is 20% for π⁺ π⁻ π⁰, which is over 5%. But the problem just says K⁰. Maybe the answer expects the K⁰_S decay since it's the short-lived component. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is K⁰ → π⁺ π⁻ (assuming K⁰_S), which is a major decay mode. Let me confirm: K⁰_S has a branching ratio of about 69% for π⁺ π⁻ and 31% for π⁰ π⁰. So either of those would work. But the problem says \"non-trivial\", so maybe π⁺ π⁻ is the answer here.\n\nMoving on to Λ⁰ (Lambda baryon). The Lambda typically decays via the weak interaction. The main decay is Λ⁰ → p + π⁻, with a branching ratio around 63.9%, which is well above 5%. Another possible decay is n + π⁰, but that's about 35.8%, which is also over 5%. But the problem says \"a\" decay mode, so either is acceptable. The first one (proton and pi-) is more common, so I'll go with that.\n\nΔ⁺⁺ (Delta plus plus). The Delta baryons decay via the strong interaction. The Delta++ typically decays into a proton and a pion: Δ⁺⁺ → p + π⁺. The branching ratio is nearly 100%, so that's the obvious choice.\n\nμ⁻ (muon minus). The muon decays via the weak interaction. The main decay is μ⁻ → e⁻ + ν̄_μ + ν_e. The branching ratio is about 99%, so that's the answer. The neutrinos here are anti-muon neutrino and electron neutrino.\n\nϕ meson (phi meson). The phi meson decays predominantly into K⁺ and K⁻, with a branching ratio around 49%, or K_S K_L with about 34%. But wait, the sum of K⁺ K⁻ and K_S K_L is about 83%, but each individual mode is over 5%. So the main decay is ϕ → K⁺ + K⁻, which is 49%, so that's over 5%. Alternatively, ϕ → K_S K_L (34%) but that's two neutral kaons. The problem might prefer the charged kaon decay since it's more straightforward.\n\nΩ⁻ (Omega minus baryon). The Omega minus is a strange baryon. Its main decay modes are weak decays. The dominant decay is Ω⁻ → Λ⁰ + K⁻, with a branching ratio of about 67.8%. Another mode is Ξ⁰ + π⁻ (23.6%), but the first one is higher. So the answer is Λ⁰ K⁻.\n\nJ/Ψ (J/psi meson). The J/ψ decays primarily via the strong interaction but with a significant electromagnetic component. The dominant decay is into hadrons. The main decay modes are J/ψ → hadrons, but specific channels include J/ψ → e⁺ e⁻ (about 5.93%) and μ⁺ μ⁻ (about 5.96%). These are just over 5%, so those are acceptable. Alternatively, J/ψ → ρ π is a possible decay but the branching ratio is lower. The leptonic decays (e⁺ e⁻ or μ⁺ μ⁻) are around 6%, which is just over 5%, so those are valid. So one of those would work. The problem says \"non-trivial\", so maybe the muon pair is the answer here. Alternatively, the three-gluon decay into hadrons, but that's a collection of many channels. But the problem wants a specific decay mode. So the leptonic decays are the ones with branching ratios just over 5%. So J/ψ → μ⁺ μ⁻ is a valid answer.\n\nLet me double-check each particle:\n\nn → p + e⁻ + ν̄_e (beta decay, ~100%): Correct.\n\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ (~99.99%): Correct.\n\nρ⁰ → π⁺ + π⁻ (~100%): Correct.\n\nK⁰ → π⁺ + π⁻ (assuming K_S, ~69%): Correct.\n\nΛ⁰ → p + π⁻ (~63.9%): Correct.\n\nΔ⁺⁺ → p + π⁺ (~99.4%): Correct.\n\nμ⁻ → e⁻ + ν̄_μ + ν_e (~99%): Correct.\n\nϕ → K⁺ + K⁻ (~49%): Correct.\n\nΩ⁻ → Λ⁰ + K⁻ (~67.8%): Correct.\n\nJ/Ψ → μ⁺ + μ⁻ (~5.96%): Correct.\n\nAll these have branching ratios above 5%, so they fit the requirement. The neutrinos are specified where needed. The K⁰ part was a bit tricky, but since K_S is part of the K⁰ system and its decay into two pions is over 5%, that's acceptable.\n</think>\n\nHere are the non-trivial decay modes (branching ratio >5%)

{"id": "atomic/3-15", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these one by one. I need to figure out which conservation laws or principles prevent each of these processes. Hmm, let's start with the first one.\n\n1. **p + n → p + Λ⁰**  \nProton and neutron are baryons with baryon number B=1 each. The Λ⁰ is a hyperon with B=1. So total baryon number is conserved (2 → 1+1=2). But the Λ⁰ has strangeness S=-1. The initial particles (p and n) have S=0. So strangeness isn't conserved here. But in strong interactions, strangeness can be violated. Wait, but this reaction involves the production of a strange particle (Λ⁰). However, the reaction is between a proton and neutron, which are hadrons. Maybe this is a strong interaction process? But the Λ⁰ has to be created via the strong force, but in strong interactions, strangeness can change, but maybe there's another issue. Wait, the Λ⁰ is a baryon with S=-1. The initial state has S=0. So the reaction would require the creation of a strange quark. But in strong interactions, you can create s-sbar pairs. However, maybe the problem is that the Λ⁰ is a strange baryon, so to produce it, you need a process that changes the strangeness. But in strong interactions, even though they can create s-sbar pairs, maybe the reaction here is not possible because of some other conservation law. Wait, but the reaction p + n → p + Λ⁰ would require changing a neutron (u d d) into a Λ⁰ (uds). So the neutron (u d d) would need to have a quark changed to s. But the strong interaction can't change quark flavors. Oh right! The strong interaction doesn't change quark flavors. So to create a strange quark, you need a weak interaction. But weak interactions are much slower. So maybe this reaction is forbidden by the conservation of strangeness in strong interactions? Wait, but in strong interactions, strangeness isn't conserved. Wait, I'm confused. Let me recall: Strangeness is conserved in strong interactions? No, actually, strangeness is not conserved in the strong interaction. The strong interaction can change strangeness via creation of s-sbar pairs. But in processes mediated by the strong force, like typical hadron interactions, strangeness can change. Wait, but maybe the reaction here is not possible because of some other reason. Alternatively, maybe the hypercharge or something else. Wait, the Λ⁰ has S=-1. The initial state has S=0. So the reaction would require ΔS=+1. But in strong interactions, ΔS=0, ±1, but maybe there's a selection rule. Wait, but in strong interactions, processes can change strangeness by ±1, 0. So maybe this reaction is allowed? But the problem states it's forbidden. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction violates another conservation law. Let's check the charges. Proton is +1, neutron 0. On the right, proton +1 and Λ⁰ is neutral. So charge is conserved (1+0=1+0). Baryon number: 1+1=1+1. So that's okay. What about other quantum numbers like isospin? The proton and neutron are in an isospin doublet. The Λ⁰ is an isosinglet (I=0). So combining p (I=1/2, I3=+1/2) and n (I=1/2, I3=-1/2) would give total isospin I=1 or 0. The Λ⁰ has I=0. So the product would be p (I=1/2) and Λ⁰ (I=0). The total isospin would be 1/2. The initial state (p + n) can have I=0 or 1. So if the initial state has I=1, then the final state (I=1/2) would not match. If the initial state has I=0, then the final state would need to have I=0. But the final state has I=1/2 (from the proton) and I=0 (Λ⁰), so total I=1/2. Therefore, isospin is not conserved. But isospin is only approximately conserved in the strong interaction. So maybe this reaction is suppressed because of isospin violation. But is that enough to forbid it? Alternatively, maybe the reaction is allowed but just not observed because of some other reason. Wait, but the problem says it's forbidden. Another angle: The Λ⁰ is a strange baryon. To produce it, you need a process that creates a strange quark. But in the strong interaction, you can create s-sbar pairs. However, the production of a Λ⁰ would require converting a u or d quark into an s quark, which the strong interaction can't do. Wait, the strong interaction doesn't change quark flavors. So to create an s quark, you need a weak interaction. But weak interactions are slow. So maybe this reaction is forbidden because it requires a change in quark flavor (from u or d to s), which the strong interaction can't do. Therefore, the process can't proceed via the strong interaction, and the weak interaction is too slow. Hence, the reaction is forbidden by the conservation of strangeness in the strong interaction? Wait, but strangeness isn't conserved in the strong interaction. Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is that the process violates strangeness conservation in the strong interaction. Wait, no. Wait, the strong interaction can change strangeness. For example, in the decay of a K meson, which involves strangeness change, but that's via the weak interaction. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The strong interaction conserves strangeness only in certain cases. Wait, no. Strangeness is not conserved in the strong interaction. For example, the production of strange particles in collisions (like in cosmic rays) happens via strong interactions, but they are produced in pairs to conserve strangeness. Wait, no. Wait, historically, strange particles were produced in pairs via strong interactions (hence, fast processes), but decayed via weak interactions (slow). So in production, the strong interaction allows ΔS=±1, but in pairs. So for example, producing a Λ⁰ and a K meson together. But in this reaction, p + n → p + Λ⁰, there's no accompanying strange particle. So the total strangeness would be 0 (initial) and -1 (final). So ΔS=-1. But in strong interactions, you can have ΔS=±1, but only if you create a pair (like S=+1 and -1). But here, only a single Λ⁰ is produced, leading to ΔS=-1. So that's not allowed. Therefore, the reaction is forbidden by strangeness conservation in the strong interaction. Wait, but earlier I thought that strong interactions don't conserve strangeness. But in reality, in strong interactions, when you create a strange quark, you must create an s and an sbar. So the total strangeness would remain zero. But in this reaction, the Λ⁰ has S=-1, and there's no other strange particle. So the total strangeness changes from 0 to -1, which is not allowed in the strong interaction. Therefore, the reaction is forbidden by strangeness conservation in the strong interaction. But wait, isn't strangeness not conserved in the strong interaction? Hmm. Wait, maybe the key here is that the strong interaction can change strangeness only in a way that conserves it in the process. For example, creating an s and sbar pair. So if you produce a particle with S=+1 and another with S=-1, the total strangeness is conserved. But producing a single S=-1 particle would violate strangeness conservation. Therefore, this reaction is forbidden because it changes strangeness by -1 without a compensating +1, which is not allowed in the strong interaction. Hence, the process is forbidden by strangeness conservation in the strong interaction. But wait, isn't strangeness not conserved in the strong interaction? I'm getting confused. Let me check: Strangeness is conserved in the strong interaction? No, actually, no. The strong interaction does not conserve strangeness. However, in processes mediated by the strong force, such as hadron production, strange particles are produced in pairs (associated production) to conserve strangeness. Wait, but that's a historical observation. The reason for associated production is that the strong interaction can create s-sbar pairs, leading to particles with S=+1 and S=-1. So the total strangeness remains zero. Therefore, in a reaction like p + n → p + Λ⁰ + K⁺ (for example), where Λ⁰ has S=-1 and K⁺ has S=+1, the total strangeness is 0. But in the given reaction, there's no K⁺, so the strangeness changes from 0 to -1. Therefore, the reaction is forbidden by the conservation of strangeness in the strong interaction. Wait, but if the strong interaction doesn't conserve strangeness, why is that a problem? Maybe the correct answer is that the reaction violates strangeness conservation, and since it's a strong interaction process (as it's a collision between hadrons), but the strong interaction can only change strangeness in pairs. Therefore, the process is forbidden because it violates strangeness conservation. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is allowed via the weak interaction, but the problem is asking why it's suppressed or forbidden. Since the strong interaction can't mediate it (due to strangeness violation), and the weak interaction is too slow, the process doesn't occur. Therefore, the reason is conservation of strangeness in the strong interaction. So the answer for 1 is that it violates strangeness conservation (ΔS= -1) in the strong interaction, which requires associated production (so ΔS=0). Therefore, the process is forbidden by strangeness conservation in the strong interaction.\n\n2. **K⁺ → π⁺ + π⁻ + π⁺ + π⁻ + π⁺ + π⁰**  \nK⁺ is a meson with S=+1. The decay products are pions, which have S=0. So the total strangeness changes from +1 to 0, which is allowed in weak interactions (since weak interactions can change strangeness). But let's check other conservation laws. Charge: K⁺ has +1. On the right: π⁺ (3 times +1), π⁻ (2 times -1), π⁰ (0). Total charge: 3(+1) + 2(-1) + 0 = +1. So charge is conserved. Baryon number: 0 → 0. So okay. Lepton numbers: no leptons, so okay. Now, what about other quantum numbers. The K⁺ has a certain angular momentum, but since it's a spin-0 particle decaying into spin-0 pions, angular momentum should be okay. What about parity or other symmetries? Alternatively, maybe the decay violates the conservation of some quantum number. Let's think about the possible decay modes. K⁺ typically decays into 2 or 3 pions. For example, K⁺ → π⁺ π⁰ (which is 2-body) or K⁺ → π⁺ π⁺ π⁻ (3-body), etc. The given decay is into 6 pions (3 π⁺, 2 π⁻, 1 π⁰). That's a lot. The question is why this decay is forbidden or suppressed. One possibility is the ΔI = 1/2 rule in kaon decays. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, phase space: higher multiplicity decays are suppressed because there's less phase space. But the question is about conservation laws. Another angle: G-parity. Pions have G-parity (-1)^I. For charged pions, G-parity is -1 (since I=1 for pions). But G-parity is conserved in strong interactions, but kaons decay via weak interactions, so G-parity might not be relevant. Alternatively, the decay violates some selection rule. Wait, the K⁺ has S=+1, and the decay violates strangeness (ΔS=1), which is allowed in weak interactions. But maybe the decay violates the conservation of some other quantum number. Let's check the Q-value. The mass of K⁺ is about 494 MeV. The mass of each pion is about 140 MeV (charged) and 135 (neutral). So total mass of 3π⁺ (3×140) + 2π⁻ (2×140) + π⁰ (135) = 3×140=420, 2×140=280, 135. Total 420+280+135=835 MeV. But the K⁺ is only 494 MeV. So the total mass of the decay products is larger than the K⁺ mass. Therefore, this decay is energetically impossible. That's a big reason. So the process is forbidden by energy conservation. Wait, but the problem is asking for conservation laws, invariance principles, or other mechanisms. So if the total mass of the decay products exceeds the parent's mass, it's impossible. Therefore, the answer is that the decay is forbidden by energy conservation. Because the sum of the rest masses of the decay products is greater than the rest mass of the K⁺. So that's the main reason.\n\n3. **K̄⁰ → π⁻ + e⁺ + ν_e**  \nK̄⁰ is the antiparticle of K⁰. Let's check the quantum numbers. K̄⁰ is composed of d s̄ (since K⁰ is d̄ s). The decay products are π⁻ (d ū), e⁺, and ν_e. Let's check conservation laws. Charge: K̄⁰ is neutral. π⁻ (-1), e⁺ (+1), ν_e (0). Total charge: -1 +1 +0 = 0. So charge conserved. Baryon number: 0 → 0. Lepton numbers: e⁺ is anti-electron, so electron lepton number is -1. The ν_e is +1. So total electron lepton number: -1 (from e⁺) +1 (from ν_e) = 0. So that's okay. Strangeness: K̄⁰ has S= -1 (since K⁰ has S=+1, so K̄⁰ has S=-1). The decay products have S=0 (pions and leptons). So ΔS=+1. Weak interactions allow ΔS=±1. So that's okay. Now, what's the issue? Let's think about the decay process. This is a semi-leptonic decay. The K̄⁰ is decaying into a pion and a lepton-antilepton pair. The question is why this is forbidden. Let's check the quark content. K̄⁰ is d s̄. To decay into π⁻ (d ū), we need to turn s̄ into ū and create e⁺ and ν_e. Let's see: s̄ → ū + e⁺ + ν_e? Wait, in weak interactions, quarks can change flavor. The s̄ quark (charge +1/3) could decay via the weak interaction. For example, s̄ → ū + e⁺ + ν_e? But that would require a charged current interaction. Let's check the charges. s̄ has charge +1/3. ū has charge -2/3. So s̄ → ū + e⁺ + ν_e. Charge: +1/3 → -2/3 +1 +0 = +1/3. So charge is conserved. But in the Standard Model, the weak interactions mediate transitions between quarks. The s̄ quark can decay into ū via a W⁺ emission, which then would produce e⁺ and ν_e. So the process would be s̄ → ū + W⁺, and W⁺ → e⁺ + ν_e. So the decay K̄⁰ → π⁻ + e⁺ + ν_e would involve the s̄ quark decaying. But let's look at the hadronic part. The K̄⁰ (d s̄) would need to turn into π⁻ (d ū). So the s̄ → ū, and the d stays as d. So the weak interaction would need to change s̄ → ū. But in the Standard Model, the CKM matrix elements govern these transitions. The s̄ → ū transition is allowed (element V_{us}), but is there a reason this decay is forbidden? Alternatively, maybe the decay violates some selection rule. Let's check the currents. The decay K̄⁀ → π⁻ e⁺ ν_e would be a charged current process. The matrix element would involve the vector and axial vector currents. But maybe the spin and angular momentum considerations allow it. Alternatively, consider the conservation of angular momentum. The kaon is spin-0, the pion is spin-0, and the leptons (e⁺ and ν_e) have spin-1/2. So total spin would need to be 0. The leptons can combine to spin 0 or 1. But neutrinos are left-handed, and positrons are right-handed in weak decays. So maybe the helicities don't allow it. Alternatively, maybe the decay is allowed, but the problem states it's forbidden. Wait, but K̄⁀ can decay into π⁻ e⁺ ν_e? Let me check real decay modes. For example, K⁺ → π⁰ e⁺ ν_e is a known decay (K⁺_e3 decay). Similarly, K⁰_L can decay into π± e∓ ν. But K̄⁀ is the antiparticle of K⁰. However, in reality, neutral kaons mix via the weak interaction into K1 and K2 (or K_S and K_L). So maybe the decay is allowed, but the problem says it's forbidden. Wait, but the problem is asking why it's forbidden. Let me think again. The decay K̄⁰ → π⁻ e⁺ ν_e. Let's check the quantum numbers. The K̄⁰ has strangeness S=-1. The decay products have S=0. So ΔS=+1. In weak interactions, ΔS=±1 is allowed. So that's okay. The decay would proceed via the s̄ → ū transition. But in the Standard Model, the s̄ → ū transition is allowed (V_{us} is non-zero). So why is this decay forbidden? Wait, maybe because of the ΔS = ΔQ rule. The ΔQ rule states that the change in strangeness ΔS equals the change in charge ΔQ in the hadronic part. In this decay, the hadronic part is K̄⁀ → π⁻. The K̄⁀ has charge 0, π⁻ has charge -1. So ΔQ = -1. The ΔS is +1 (from S=-1 to 0). So ΔS=+1, ΔQ=-1. Therefore, ΔS ≠ ΔQ. The ΔS=ΔQ rule is a selection rule in semi-leptonic decays. If this rule is violated, the decay is forbidden. But in reality, the ΔS=ΔQ rule is not absolute; there can be violations due to penguin diagrams or other effects, but in the Standard Model, it's mostly obeyed. So if the decay violates ΔS=ΔQ, it's suppressed. In this case, ΔS=+1 and ΔQ=-1, so they are not equal. Therefore, the decay is forbidden by the ΔS=ΔQ rule. Hence, the answer is violation of the ΔS=ΔQ rule in semi-leptonic weak decays.\n\n4. **Λ⁰ → K⁰ + π⁰**  \nΛ⁰ is a baryon with S=-1. K⁰ is a meson with S=+1. π⁰ has S=0. So total S: -1 → +1 +0 = +1. ΔS=+2. Weak interactions allow ΔS=±1, 0. So ΔS=+2 is not allowed. Therefore, the decay is forbidden by strangeness conservation in the weak interaction. Wait, but weak interactions can change strangeness by more than 1. For example, in some rare decays. But typically, weak processes change S by ±1. However, in this case, ΔS=+2. So that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe there's another conservation law. Let's check other quantum numbers. Baryon number: Λ⁰ has B=1, K⁰ and π⁰ have B=0. So B is conserved. Charge: Λ⁰ is neutral, K⁰ and π⁰ are neutral. So charge conserved. The problem is the change in strangeness by +2. Weak interactions can have ΔS=±1 (like in kaon decays), but ΔS=±2 would require two s quark transitions, which is possible only via higher-order processes. But such processes would be highly suppressed. Therefore, the decay is forbidden because ΔS=+2, which is not allowed in weak interactions (only ΔS=±1). Hence, the answer is violation of strangeness conservation (ΔS=+2) in the weak interaction.\n\n5. **π⁺ → e⁺ + ν_e (relative to π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ)**  \nThe pion decay into a muon is much more common than into an electron. The question is why the electronic mode is suppressed. This is a well-known problem. The answer is helicity suppression. Pions are spin-0 particles. The decay into a lepton and antineutrino must conserve angular momentum. The leptons (e⁺ and ν_e) have spins 1/2 each. To combine to total spin 0, their spins must be opposite. But in the weak interaction, the charged current couples only to left-handed particles and right-handed antiparticles. The antineutrino is right-handed, and the positron (e⁺) is right-handed. So their spins are both aligned in the same direction. Therefore, their total spin would be 1, which can't combine with orbital angular momentum (which is zero for a pion at rest) to give total spin 0. This leads to a suppression. However, for the muon decay, the same applies, but the muon is much heavier, so the phase space is different. The matrix element involves the lepton mass, so the amplitude is proportional to the lepton mass. Therefore, the electronic mode is suppressed by a factor of (m_e/m_μ)^2. Hence, the suppression is due to helicity considerations and the V-A structure of the weak interaction, leading to a rate proportional to the square of the lepton mass. So the answer is helicity suppression due to the V-A nature of the weak interaction, leading to a rate proportional to the square of the lepton mass.\n\n6. **K_L⁰ → e⁺ + e⁻**  \nK_L⁰ is the long-lived neutral kaon. The decay into e⁺ e⁻ is a leptonic decay. Let's check conservation laws. Charge: 0 → +1 -1 =0. Baryon number: 0 →0. Lepton numbers: e⁺ and e⁻ cancel each other's lepton numbers. So that's okay. Strangeness: K_L⁰ is a mixture of K⁰ and K̄⁰, so S can be ±1. The decay products have S=0. So ΔS=±1, allowed in weak interactions. But why is this decay forbidden or suppressed? This is a flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) process. In the Standard Model, FCNCs are suppressed at tree level and only occur via loop diagrams (like the GIM mechanism). The decay K_L⁰ → e⁺ e⁻ would require a neutral current changing strangeness (ΔS=1), which is forbidden at tree level. Therefore, the process is forbidden by the absence of flavor-changing neutral currents in the Standard Model at tree level. However, such processes can occur via loops (like box diagrams), but they are highly suppressed. But the problem states \"suppressing or forbidding\", so the answer is that it's forbidden at tree level due to the GIM mechanism suppressing FCNCs, and loop contributions are highly suppressed. Alternatively, the decay violates the ΔS = ΔQ rule, but I think the main reason is FCNC suppression. So the answer is suppression due to the absence of flavor-changing neutral currents (GIM mechanism).\n\n7. **K⁻ → π⁰ + e⁻**  \nK⁻ is a meson with S=-1. π⁰ has S=0, e⁻ has S=0. So ΔS=+1. Weak interaction allows ΔS=±1. Charge: K⁻ (-1) → π⁰ (0) + e⁻ (-1). Charge conserved. Baryon number: 0 →0. Lepton number: e⁻ has L_e=+1, so conserved. So why is this decay forbidden? Let's check the quark content. K⁻ is s̄ u. To decay into π⁰ (u ū - d d̄ mixture) and e⁻. The s̄ quark would need to decay into something. For example, s̄ → ū + W⁻, and W⁻ → e⁻ + ν̄_e. But the hadronic part would be K⁻ → π⁰ + something. Wait, but the decay K⁻ → π⁰ + e⁻ would require the s̄ quark to turn into ū and emit a W⁻, which then decays into e⁻ ν̄_e. But the hadronic part would be s̄ u → u ū (for π⁰) plus the W⁻. Wait, maybe the quark process is s̄ → ū + W⁻, and the u from the K⁻ combines with the ū from the s̄ decay to form a π⁰ (u ū). But then the W⁻ would need to produce e⁻ ν̄_e. However, the problem is that the charge doesn't add up. Let me see: K⁻ is s̄ u (charge -1/3 + 2/3 = +1/3? Wait, no. Wait, s̄ has charge +1/3, u has charge +2/3. So s̄ u has charge +1/3 +2/3 = +1. Wait, K⁻ has charge -1. Wait, no. Wait, K⁻ is composed of s̄ and u antiquark? No, K⁻ is s̄ u. Wait, s̄ is charge +1/3, u is charge +2/3. So total charge +1. But K⁻ has charge -1. Wait, no. Wait, K⁻ is actually composed of an anti-s quark and a u antiquark? No, no. Let me get this straight. The K⁻ is composed of an s antiquark (s̄) and a u quark. So s̄ has charge +1/3, u has charge +2/3. Total charge +1/3 +2/3 = +1. But K⁻ has charge -1. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no. The K⁻ is made of an s antiquark and a u antiquark? No. Wait, the K⁻ is the antiparticle of the K⁺. The K⁺ is u s̄. So K⁻ is s ū. So s quark has charge -1/3, ū has charge -2/3. Total charge -1/3 -2/3 = -1. Yes. So K⁻ is s ū. To decay into π⁰ (which is (u ū - d d̄)/√2) and e⁻. So the s quark (charge -1/3) needs to decay into something. The e⁻ has charge -1. So the s quark must decay into a quark with charge +2/3 (since -1/3 → +2/3 + (-1)). That would require s → u + W⁻, and W⁻ → e⁻ + ν̄_e. But the s quark is in the K⁻ (s ū). So s → u + W⁻. Then the W⁻ → e⁻ + ν̄_e. The remaining quarks are u (from s decay) and ū (from the original K⁻). The u and ū can form a π⁰ (u ū component). So the decay would be K⁻ (s ū) → π⁰ (u ū) + e⁻ + ν̄_e. But the problem states the decay is K⁻ → π⁰ + e⁻, missing the ν̄_e. Therefore, the decay as written (without the neutrino) is impossible because it violates lepton number conservation. The decay K⁻ → π⁰ + e⁻ would require the emission of a charged lepton (e⁻) without a neutrino, which is not allowed in the Standard Model. Therefore, the correct decay would be K⁻ → π⁰ + e⁻ + ν̄_e, which is allowed. But the given process lacks the neutrino, so it's forbidden by lepton number conservation. The problem states the decay as K⁻ → π⁰ + e⁻, which is missing the antineutrino. Hence, the answer is violation of lepton number conservation (missing ν̄_e).\n\n8. **π⁰ → γ + γ + γ**  \nThe neutral pion typically decays into two photons (π⁰ → γγ). The question is why the decay into three photons is forbidden. The pion is a pseudoscalar (J^PC=0^-+). Photons are vector bosons (J^P=1^-). Let's consider the conservation laws. For the decay into three photons, the total angular momentum must be 0. Each photon has spin 1, so combining three spins to get total spin 0. However, photons are bosons, so the wavefunction must be symmetric under exchange. But three photons would require a symmetric combination of their spins. However, it's impossible to combine three spin-1 particles to get total spin 0 with a symmetric wavefunction. Alternatively, consider parity. The pion has parity -1. Each photon has parity -1. So the total parity of three photons is (-1)^3 = -1. The pion's parity is -1, so parity is conserved. Wait, but the pion is pseudoscalar (P=-1), and three photons would have P=(-1)^3 = -1. So parity is conserved. Hmm. Then why is the decay forbidden? Another angle: Charge conjugation. The pion is a neutral meson and has C-parity +1. For photons, each has C=-1. So three photons would have C=(-1)^3 = -1. The pion has C=+1, so the decay π⁰ → 3γ violates C-parity conservation. Therefore, the decay is forbidden by C-parity conservation. The neutral pion has C=+1, and three photons have C=-1, so the decay violates C-parity. Hence, the answer is violation of C-parity conservation.\n\n9. **K_L⁰ → π⁺ + π⁻**  \nK_L⁰ is the long-lived neutral kaon, which is a mixture of K⁰ and K̄⁰. The decay into two pions (π⁺ π⁻) is something that K_S⁰ does, but K_L⁰ mainly decays into three pions. The question is why K_L⁰ → π⁺ π⁻ is forbidden. This is related to CP violation. Originally, it was thought that K_L⁰ is CP-odd, while the π⁺ π⁻ state is CP-even. Therefore, the decay would violate CP, making it forbidden. However, in reality, a small amount of CP violation allows this decay to occur, which was historically observed. But the problem is asking for the reason it's suppressed or forbidden. So the primary reason is that K_L⁰ is (mostly) CP-odd, and the two-pion state is CP-even, leading to CP violation if the decay occurs. However, since CP is not conserved (as discovered), the decay is allowed but suppressed. But the problem might be expecting the answer that it's forbidden by CP conservation, but since CP is violated, it's allowed but rare. However, in the absence of CP violation, the decay would be forbidden. Therefore, the suppression is due to CP violation being small. But the problem might be looking for the answer that it's forbidden by CP conservation, but in reality, it's observed due to CP violation. So the answer is that the decay is suppressed due to CP violation (since K_L⁰ is predominantly CP-odd and the π⁺ π⁻ state is CP-even), but historically, it was forbidden under the assumption of CP conservation.\n\n10. **K⁺ → π⁺ + π⁺ + π⁰**  \nK⁺ decay into three pions. Let's check conservation laws. Charge: K⁺ → π⁺ + π⁺ + π⁰. Charge is +1 → +1 +1 +0 = +2. Wait, that's +2 on the right. But K⁺ has charge +1. So charge isn't conserved. Wait, no. Wait, K⁺ has charge +1. The decay products are two π⁺ (each +1) and one π⁰ (0). Total charge is +2, which doesn't match. Therefore, the decay is impossible due to charge conservation. But wait, the problem states the decay as K⁺ → π⁺ + π⁺ + π⁰. That would have total charge +2, which violates charge conservation. Hence, the answer is violation of charge conservation.\n</think>\n\n1. **$p + n \\rightarrow p + \\Lambda^0$**  \n   The reaction violates **strangeness conservation** in the strong interaction.

{"id": "atomic/3-23", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to describe the properties of the various types of pions and discuss the experiments that determined their spin, parity, and isospin. Let me start by recalling what I know about pions.\n\nFirst, pions are mesons, which are particles made of a quark and an antiquark. There are three types of pions: π⁺, π⁻, and π⁰. The charged pions, π⁺ and π⁻, are each other's antiparticles, while the neutral pion π⁰ is its own antiparticle. Their quark compositions are π⁺ as u anti-d, π⁻ as d anti-u, and π⁰ as a superposition of u anti-u and d anti-d, maybe with some s anti-s component, but I think mostly u and d.\n\nNow, their properties: spin, parity, and isospin. I remember that pions have spin 0 because they are pseudoscalar mesons. Wait, pseudoscalar means spin 0 and parity -1. So their total angular momentum J is 0, and parity P is -1. Isospin for pions should be I=1, since they form a triplet (π⁺, π⁰, π⁻), which corresponds to isospin triplet with I₃ = +1, 0, -1 respectively.\n\nBut how were these properties determined experimentally? Let me think about the experiments. For spin, maybe they looked at angular distributions in scattering or decay processes. For parity, perhaps analyzing decay products and their angular momentum. Isospin would relate to their interactions and symmetry properties.\n\nStarting with spin. If pions have spin 0, then in reactions like pion-nucleon scattering, the angular distribution would depend on the spin. For example, in the process π + N → π + N, the differential cross-section might show certain symmetries if the pion is spin 0. Alternatively, considering decay processes. Pions decay primarily into leptons (π⁺→μ⁺νμ, π⁻→μ⁻ν̄μ) and π⁰→γγ. The decay of a spin-0 particle into two photons (for π⁰) would have specific angular correlations. Wait, but π⁰ decays into two photons, and if the pion has spin 0, the photons' polarization should be correlated. For the charged pions decaying into a muon and neutrino, since the pion is spin 0, the muon and neutrino must have their spins opposite. But neutrinos are left-handed, so maybe the muon's helicity is measured. If the pion has spin 0, the muon from the decay should be polarized. Experiments measuring the muon's polarization could confirm the pion's spin.\n\nFor parity, the intrinsic parity of the pion is determined by how it transforms under spatial inversion. Since pions are pseudoscalar, their parity is -1. One way to determine this is through the decay of the pion into two photons. The two-photon system must have even parity because each photon has intrinsic parity -1, and their combined parity is (-1)^2 * (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. For the pion (parity -1), the two photons must have L=1 to get total parity (-1)^2 * (-1)^1 = -1. But wait, photons are bosons, so the total wavefunction must be symmetric. The two-photon state must be symmetric under exchange. The spin part for two photons can be symmetric (like spin 0 or 2) and the spatial part (L=1) would need to be symmetric as well. However, for two photons, the allowed total spin states are 0 and 2 because of Bose statistics. If the pion has spin 0 and parity -1, then the two photons must have angular momentum L=1. But the problem is that for two photons, their wavefunction must be even under exchange. The spin part for spin 0 is symmetric (since singlet state), and the spatial part with L=1 is antisymmetric (since exchange would give a factor of (-1)^L = -1). So the total wavefunction would be symmetric (spin) * antisymmetric (spatial) = antisymmetric, which is not allowed. Therefore, this suggests a contradiction unless the spin and spatial parts combine to give an overall symmetric wavefunction. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The pion is spin 0, so the decay must conserve angular momentum. The two photons must have total spin 0 (since pion spin is 0). But each photon has spin 1, so combining two spin 1s can give total spin 0, 1, or 2. However, for two identical photons, the total wavefunction must be symmetric. The spin state with total spin 0 is antisymmetric (since |0,0> = (|1,-1> - | -1,1>)/sqrt(2) or something like that?), but maybe not. Wait, actually, the spin states for two photons: each photon has two polarization states (left and right circular), so combining them, the total spin states can be constructed. For two photons moving in opposite directions, their helicities can be either both +1 or both -1, or opposite. But the total spin state must be symmetric. If the pion is spin 0, the two photons must have their spins combined to 0. But if the spin state is symmetric, then the spatial part (angular momentum L) must also be symmetric. The parity of the two-photon system is (-1)^L * (+1) (since each photon has parity -1, so (-1)^2 = 1). Wait, parity of each photon is -1, so combined parity is (-1)^2 * (-1)^L = (-1)^L. The pion has parity -1, so (-1)^L = -1, which implies L must be odd. But the total angular momentum J must be 0 (pion's spin). So L must equal the total spin S of the two photons. Since J = L + S, and J=0, then L and S must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. But S can be 0 or 2 for two photons. If S=0, then L must be 0, but that would give parity +1, which contradicts. If S=2, then L must be 2 to have J=0? Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe there's a better way. The key point is that the decay π⁰ → γγ cannot proceed if the pion has spin 1 because of the Landau-Yang theorem, which states that a spin-1 particle cannot decay into two photons. Therefore, the fact that π⁰ decays into two photons implies that its spin is 0. That's a crucial experiment. So the observation of π⁰ → γγ rules out spin 1 and confirms spin 0. Then, for parity, since the decay occurs, the parity must be -1. Because for the two-photon system with L=0 (if spin 0), but earlier confusion arises. Wait, Landau-Yang theorem says spin 1 can't decay to two photons, so spin 0 is allowed. Then, the parity is determined by the angular momentum. If the pion is pseudoscalar (J^P = 0^-), then the two photons must have their polarizations in a way that gives overall parity -1. The two photons must have their polarization vectors such that their product is a pseudoscalar. But how? Maybe through the angle between their polarization vectors. Alternatively, the parity can be determined from the angular distribution in the decay. For example, the distribution of the decay products. If the pion has parity -1, the decay amplitude would have certain symmetry properties. Another way is to look at the capture of negative pions by deuterium nuclei. For example, the reaction π⁻ + d → n + n. The deuteron has spin 1, and the pion is spin 0. The orbital angular momentum in the capture would affect the parity. The initial parity is the pion's parity times the deuteron's parity times (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. The deuteron has parity +1. The final state is two neutrons, which are identical fermions, so their wavefunction must be antisymmetric. The spin of each neutron is 1/2, so the total spin can be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). The spatial part would have a certain symmetry based on the orbital angular momentum. The parity of the final state is (-1)^L', where L' is the orbital angular momentum between the two neutrons. For the reaction to conserve parity, the initial and final parities must be equal. If the pion has parity -1, then initial parity is (-1) * (+1) * (-1)^L = (-1)^(L+1). The final parity is (-1)^L'. So (-1)^(L+1) = (-1)^L', which implies L' = L +1 mod 2. But also, the total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial total angular momentum is J = deuteron's spin (1) + pion's spin (0) + orbital L. So J_initial = 1 + L. The final state is two neutrons with spin 0 or 1 and orbital L', so J_final = S (0 or 1) + L'. So J_initial = J_final. For low-energy pions, the capture is likely to be s-wave (L=0). Then J_initial = 1. The final state must have J=1. The two neutrons have spin S=1 (triplet) and L'=0, giving J=1, or S=0 (singlet) and L'=1. But the Pauli exclusion principle requires that the total wavefunction (spin × spatial × isospin) is antisymmetric. The isospin part for two neutrons is symmetric (since they are both isospin 1/2, and in a symmetric state as the total isospin is 1 for two neutrons? Wait, neutrons are part of the isospin doublet, so two neutrons would have isospin I=1 (symmetric) or I=0 (antisymmetric). But in the reaction π⁻ + d → n + n, the initial isospin is I=1 (pion) + I=0 (deuteron) = I=1. So the final state must have I=1. The two neutrons have I=1 (each neutron has I=1/2, so combining two gives I=1 or 0). To get I=1, the isospin part is symmetric. Therefore, the spin × spatial part must be antisymmetric. If the spin is S=1 (symmetric), then the spatial part (L') must be antisymmetric, which requires L' to be odd. If spin is S=0 (antisymmetric), then spatial part must be symmetric, requiring L' even. But J_initial is 1 (from L=0, deuteron spin 1). So J_final must be 1. If S=1 and L'=0, then J=1. But L'=0 is even, so spatial part is symmetric. But spin is symmetric, so spin × spatial is symmetric, which combined with isospin symmetric would make the total wavefunction symmetric, violating Pauli. Therefore, this is not allowed. Alternatively, if S=1 and L'=1 (odd), then J can be 0,1,2. But J needs to be 1. So possible. But then spatial part is antisymmetric (L'=1), spin symmetric, so spin × spatial is antisymmetric, which combined with isospin symmetric gives total antisymmetric. That works. But L'=1 would mean parity of final state is (-1)^1 = -1. Initial parity is (-1)^(0+1) = -1. So parity is conserved. Alternatively, if S=0 and L'=1, then J=1. Spin part is antisymmetric (S=0), spatial part symmetric (L'=1 is odd, but wait, L'=1 is odd, so spatial part is (-1)^1 = -1, which is antisymmetric under exchange. Wait, spatial wavefunction under exchange of the two neutrons: the exchange involves swapping their positions, which for orbital angular momentum L' gives a factor of (-1)^L'. So if L'=1, exchange gives -1, so spatial part is antisymmetric. Spin part S=0 is antisymmetric (singlet), so spin × spatial is (-1) * (-1) = +1, symmetric. Combined with isospin symmetric (I=1), total wavefunction is symmetric × symmetric = symmetric, which violates Pauli. Therefore, this is not allowed. So the only possibility is S=1 and L'=1, which gives spin × spatial = symmetric × antisymmetric = antisymmetric, combined with isospin symmetric gives total antisymmetric, which is allowed. Therefore, the final state must have S=1 and L'=1. But then the parity of the final state is (-1)^L' = -1, which matches the initial parity of -1. Therefore, this reaction can occur only if the pion has parity -1. If the pion had parity +1, then initial parity would be (+1) * (+1) * (-1)^0 = +1, and final parity would need to be +1, which would require L' even. But with J_initial=1, the possible L' and S combinations would not work due to Pauli exclusion. Therefore, the observation of the reaction π⁻ + d → n + n implies that the pion has negative parity. So that's one experiment for parity.\n\nFor isospin, the pion forms an isospin triplet. The concept of isospin suggests that particles in the same multiplet have similar masses and interactions. The three pions (π⁺, π⁰, π⁻) have nearly the same mass (with π⁰ slightly lighter due to electromagnetic mass differences), supporting the isospin triplet assignment. Experiments would involve studying scattering processes and their cross-sections in terms of isospin symmetry. For example, the scattering of pions on nucleons. The nucleons (proton and neutron) form an isospin doublet (I=1/2). The pion-nucleon interaction can be described by the coupling to the total isospin. For example, the cross-sections for π⁺ + p → π⁺ + p and π⁻ + p → π⁻ + p would differ if isospin is a good symmetry. Alternatively, using charge independence of nuclear forces, which is a consequence of isospin symmetry. Another experiment could be the production of pions in nucleon-nucleon collisions. For instance, p + p → d + π⁺, which would relate to the isospin structure of the interaction. Since the initial state (two protons) has total isospin I=1 (as each proton is I=1/2, I₃=+1/2), the final state has a deuteron (I=0) and π⁺ (I=1, I₃=+1). Therefore, the reaction conserves isospin, going from I=1 to I=1. If isospin is conserved, the cross-section would be determined by the isospin coupling factors. Comparing different reaction channels can test the isospin assignments. For example, the cross-section for p + n → d + π⁰ would be related to the cross-section for p + p → d + π⁺ by isospin factors. These kinds of experiments support the pion's isospin triplet nature.\n\nPutting this all together, the experiments to determine spin, parity, and isospin are:\n\n- Spin: Observation of π⁰ → γγ, which is forbidden for spin 1 (Landau-Yang theorem), hence spin 0. Also, angular distributions in scattering experiments.\n\n- Parity: Analysis of π⁻ capture by deuterium leading to two neutrons, requiring negative parity to satisfy Pauli exclusion and parity conservation.\n\n- Isospin: Charge independence in pion-nucleon scattering and production experiments, confirming the triplet structure and symmetric cross-sections under isospin rotations.\n\nI should also mention other experiments. For example, the spin of charged pions could be determined by studying the decay π⁺ → μ⁺ ν_μ. Since the pion is spin 0, the muon and neutrino must have opposite spins. Given that neutrinos are left-handed, the muon should be right-handed (helicity). Experiments measuring the muon's polarization confirmed that it's fully polarized, supporting the pion's spin 0. The parity can also be inferred from the angular distribution of the decay products. For a spin 0 pion decaying, the muon and neutrino would be emitted isotropically if parity is conserved, but since weak interactions violate parity, there's a preferred direction. However, the existence of the decay itself (allowed only if parity is violated) might not directly determine the pion's parity, but the pion's intrinsic parity is determined through strong interaction processes like the deuteron capture.\n\nAnother point for parity: the decay π⁰ → γγ. The polarization of the photons can be measured. For a spin 0 pion, the two photons must have their polarization vectors perpendicular to each other in the plane transverse to their direction of motion. This is because the pion has J=0, so the photons' spins (which are transverse) must combine to total spin 0. This results in a correlation where the photons' polarizations are at right angles. Experiments observing this correlation support the spin 0 and parity -1 assignment.\n\nFor isospin, looking at the cross-sections for pion production in nucleon collisions. For example, the reaction p + p → d + π⁺ has a certain cross-section, and if isospin is conserved, the cross-section for p + n → d + π⁰ should be half that (due to isospin Clebsch-Gordan coefficients). Experimental verification of these ratios would confirm the isospin assignments.\n\nIn summary, the pion's properties are:\n\n- Types: π⁺, π⁰, π⁻ forming an isospin triplet (I=1).\n\n- Spin 0 (determined by decay to two photons and angular distributions).\n\n- Parity -1 (determined by deuterium capture and photon polarization in π⁰ decay).\n\n- Isospin I=1 (supported by mass degeneracy and scattering cross-section symmetries).\n</think>\n\nThe pions (π⁺, π⁰, π⁻) are pseudoscalar mesons with the following properties:  \n- **Quark composition**: π⁺ = \\(u\\bar{d}\\), π⁻ = \\(d\\bar{u}\\), π⁰ = \\(\\frac{u\\bar{u} - d\\bar{d}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) (primarily).  \n- **Spin (\\(J\\))**: 0 (scalar mesons).  \n- **Parity (\\(P\\))**: \\(-1\\) (pseudoscalar).  \n- **Isospin (\\(I\\))**: 1 (forming a triplet with \\(I_3 = +1, 0, -1\\)).  \n\n### Experiments Determining Spin, Parity, and Isospin  \n1. **Spin (\\(J = 0\\))**:  \n   - **π⁰ → γγ decay**: The Landau-Yang theorem forbids spin-1 particles from decaying into two photons.

{"id": "atomic/4-34", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an antiproton colliding with a proton, and they annihilate to produce two negative pions and two positive pions. The question has four parts, starting with finding the average kinetic energy per pion. Let me start by recalling some physics concepts here.\n\nFirst, since the antiproton and proton are annihilating, their rest mass energy should convert into the energy of the pions. But wait, the problem mentions a slowly moving antiproton. If it's moving slowly, then its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. So, maybe we can approximate the total energy as just the combined rest mass of the proton and antiproton?\n\nProtons and antiprotons have the same rest mass, right? The rest mass energy of a proton is about 938 MeV. So, the total rest mass energy before annihilation would be 938 MeV (proton) + 938 MeV (antiproton) = 1876 MeV. But wait, when they annihilate, they produce pions. Each pion has a rest mass of 140 MeV. Since there are four pions produced (two negative and two positive), the total rest mass energy of the pions would be 4 * 140 MeV = 560 MeV. \n\nSo, the initial rest energy is 1876 MeV, and the final rest energy is 560 MeV. The difference must be the kinetic energy distributed among the pions. Therefore, the total kinetic energy available is 1876 - 560 = 1316 MeV. Since there are four pions, the average kinetic energy per pion would be 1316 / 4 = 329 MeV. Hmm, but wait, is that right? Let me check again.\n\nWait, but in particle physics, when particles annihilate, the energy available is the total energy of the system. If the antiproton is moving slowly, then the total energy is approximately twice the rest mass energy of the proton (since both proton and antiproton are at rest, but in reality, the antiproton is moving, but if it's slow, then kinetic energy is negligible). So, the total energy is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. Then, the energy must go into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the pions. So, the rest mass of the four pions is 4 * 140 = 560 MeV. Therefore, the remaining energy is 1876 - 560 = 1316 MeV, which is the total kinetic energy. Divided by four pions gives 329 MeV per pion. That seems high. Wait, but pions are relativistic particles here? Because their rest mass is 140 MeV, and if their kinetic energy is 329 MeV, that's more than twice their rest mass. So, they would be moving relativistically. But maybe that's okay. So part (a) answer would be 329 MeV. Let me note that.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"average kinetic energy per pion\". So, yes, that calculation seems straightforward. Let me confirm once more. The initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of proton and antiproton, since kinetic energy is negligible. Then, subtract the rest energy of the four pions to get the total kinetic energy. Then divide by four. So, 1876 - 560 = 1316. 1316 /4 = 329. So, part (a) is 329 MeV. Okay.\n\nMoving to part (b): What is the magnitude of the momentum of a pion with such an energy? So, each pion has a total energy E = rest energy + kinetic energy = 140 + 329 = 469 MeV. Then, the momentum p can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Solving for p: p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c. Plugging in the numbers: E = 469 MeV, m c² = 140 MeV. So, p = sqrt(469² - 140²) / c. Let me compute that. 469 squared is 469*469. Let me calculate that: 400² = 160000, 69²=4761, 2*400*69=55200. So, (400+69)^2 = 160000 + 55200 + 4761 = 160000+55200=215200 +4761=219,961. Then, 140 squared is 19,600. So, 219,961 - 19,600 = 200,361. Then, sqrt(200,361) is 447.6 (since 447^2 = 199,809; 448^2 = 200,704. So between 447 and 448. Let's compute 447.6^2: 447^2 = 199809, 0.6^2=0.36, 2*447*0.6=536.4. So, (447 + 0.6)^2 = 199809 + 536.4 + 0.36 = 199809 + 536.4 = 200345.4 + 0.36 = 200345.76. Which is very close to 200,361. So, 447.6^2 = 200,345.76. The difference is 200,361 - 200,345.76 = 15.24. So, each 0.1 increase in the number adds approximately 2*447.6*0.1 + 0.1^2 = 89.52 + 0.01 = 89.53. So, 15.24 /89.53 ≈ 0.17. So, sqrt(200,361) ≈ 447.6 + 0.17 ≈ 447.77. So approximately 447.8 MeV/c. So, the momentum is approximately 448 MeV/c. Let me check with exact calculation. Alternatively, use calculator steps:\n\n469^2 = (470 -1)^2 = 470^2 - 2*470*1 +1 = 220900 - 940 +1 = 220900 -940 = 219,960 +1 = 219,961. Then 140^2 = 19,600. So, 219,961 -19,600 = 200,361. sqrt(200,361). Let's see, 447^2 = 199,809. 448^2 = 200,704. So, 200,361 is between 447 and 448. The difference between 200,361 and 199,809 is 552. So, 552 / (448^2 -447^2) = 552 / ( (448-447)(448+447)) = 552 / (1*895) ≈ 0.617. So, sqrt(200,361) ≈ 447 + 0.617 ≈ 447.617. So approximately 447.6 MeV/c. So, the momentum is approximately 447.6 MeV/c. So, rounding to three significant figures, 448 MeV/c. But maybe the answer expects a more precise calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can use exact values. Let me compute sqrt(200361). Let's see, 447*447=199809, 448*448=200,704. 200,361-199,809=552. So, 552/(200,704 -199,809)=552/895≈0.617. So, sqrt(200,361)=447 +0.617≈447.617. So, approximately 447.6 MeV/c. So, the magnitude of the momentum is approximately 448 MeV/c. So, part (b) answer is 448 MeV/c.\n\nPart (c): What is the magnitude of the velocity? In units of c. So, velocity v can be found using the relation between momentum and velocity. The relativistic momentum p = gamma m v. Also, total energy E = gamma m c². So, from E = gamma m c² and p = gamma m v. So, dividing p by E: p/E = v / c². Therefore, v = (p c²)/E * c. Wait, let me check. p = gamma m v. E = gamma m c². So, p = (E / c²) v. Therefore, v = (p c²)/E. So, v = (p c²) / E. Since p is in MeV/c, E is in MeV. So, plugging in p = 447.6 MeV/c, E = 469 MeV. Then, v = (447.6 MeV/c * c²) / 469 MeV = (447.6 * c) / 469. The MeV cancels out. So, v = (447.6 / 469) c ≈ 0.954 c. Let me compute 447.6 divided by 469. Let's see, 447.6 /469 ≈ 0.954. So, approximately 0.954c. Let me check with exact numbers. 447.6 /469. Let's compute 447.6 ÷ 469. Let's do 447.6 ÷ 469. 469 × 0.9 = 422.1. 447.6 - 422.1 = 25.5. 25.5 /469 ≈ 0.054. So total is 0.9 + 0.054 ≈ 0.954. So, approximately 0.954c. So, the velocity is about 0.954 times the speed of light. So, part (c) answer is approximately 0.954c.\n\nPart (d): If the annihilation led instead to 2 photons, what would be the wavelength of each? (cm). Hmm. So, if the proton and antiproton annihilate into two photons, then we need to find the wavelength of each photon. First, since the proton and antiproton are at rest (or the antiproton is moving slowly), the total momentum is zero. Therefore, the two photons must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So, each photon would have the same energy and travel in opposite directions. The total energy available is the rest energy of proton and antiproton, which is 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. So, each photon would have energy 1876 /2 = 938 MeV. Then, the wavelength is related to the energy via E = hc / lambda. So, lambda = hc / E. But we need to compute this in cm. Let's recall that hc is approximately 12400 eV·angstrom, but we need to convert units. Let me recall the exact value of hc in MeV·fm. 1 eV = 1e6 eV, 1 MeV = 1e6 eV. hc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. So, hc = 197.33 MeV·fm. Therefore, lambda = hc / E. For each photon, E = 938 MeV. So, lambda = 197.33 MeV·fm / 938 MeV = 197.33 /938 fm ≈ 0.2103 fm. Wait, but 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. 1 cm is 1e-2 meters. So, 1 fm = 1e-13 cm. Therefore, 0.2103 fm = 0.2103e-13 cm = 2.103e-14 cm. But wait, that seems extremely small. Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Wait, if hc is 197.33 MeV·fm, then lambda in fm is hc (MeV·fm) divided by E (MeV). So, yes, 197.33 /938 ≈ 0.2103 fm. Which is 0.2103e-15 meters. Converting to centimeters: 1 meter is 100 cm, so 0.2103e-15 meters = 0.2103e-13 cm = 2.103e-14 cm. But that's 2.1e-14 cm. But that's a very small wavelength, which makes sense for high-energy photons. However, let me verify the value of hc. Alternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let's compute the wavelength using E = hc / lambda. So, E in MeV, hc in MeV·cm. Let's find hc in MeV·cm. Planck constant h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s. Speed of light c = 3e8 m/s. So, hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1 MeV = 1.602e-13 J. Therefore, hc in MeV·m is 1.9878e-25 / 1.602e-13 = 1.9878 /1.602e-12 ≈ 1.241e-12 MeV·m. Since 1 m = 100 cm, hc in MeV·cm is 1.241e-12 MeV·m / 100 cm/m = 1.241e-14 MeV·cm. Therefore, lambda = hc / E = (1.241e-14 MeV·cm) / (938 MeV) ≈ 1.241e-14 /938 ≈ 1.323e-17 cm. Wait, that's 1.32e-17 cm. But this contradicts the previous result. Hmm, so there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversions. Let me try again. Let's compute hc in units of MeV·fm. 1 fm = 1e-15 m. So, hc = 197.33 MeV·fm. To convert this to MeV·cm, note that 1 fm = 1e-13 cm. So, 1 MeV·fm = 1e-13 MeV·cm. Therefore, hc = 197.33e-13 MeV·cm = 1.9733e-11 MeV·cm. Then, lambda = hc / E = (1.9733e-11 MeV·cm) / (938 MeV) ≈ 2.104e-14 cm. Which matches the first calculation. So, approximately 2.1e-14 cm. But that's 2.1e-14 cm, which is 2.1e-16 meters, or 0.21 femtometers. Which is consistent with gamma rays from nuclear transitions having wavelengths on the order of femtometers. So, the wavelength is about 2.1e-14 cm. But the problem asks for the answer in cm. So, written in scientific notation, that's 2.1e-14 cm. But maybe we need to express it more precisely. Let's compute hc / E exactly. hc = 197.33 MeV·fm. E = 938 MeV. So, lambda = 197.33 /938 fm ≈ 0.2103 fm. Convert fm to cm: 1 fm = 1e-13 cm. So, 0.2103 fm = 0.2103e-13 cm = 2.103e-14 cm. So, approximately 2.10e-14 cm. So, the wavelength is about 2.1e-14 cm. But let me check if there's a standard way to present this. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using E = 938 MeV and converting to joules, then using lambda = hc/E. Let's try that approach. E = 938 MeV = 938e6 eV = 938e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 1.503e-10 J. h = 6.626e-34 J·s. c = 3e8 m/s. So, lambda = hc / E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 1.503e-10 = (1.9878e-25) / 1.503e-10 ≈ 1.322e-15 meters. Convert meters to cm: 1.322e-15 m = 1.322e-13 cm. Wait, that's 1.32e-13 cm. But this contradicts the previous result. Now I'm confused. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's check the units again. If hc is 197.33 MeV·fm, then lambda in fm is 197.33 / E (MeV). So, for E = 938 MeV, lambda = 197.33 /938 ≈0.2103 fm = 0.2103e-15 m = 0.2103e-13 cm = 2.103e-14 cm. But when calculating via Joules, we get 1.32e-13 cm. These are different by a factor of about 6. So, which is correct? Let me check the value of hc in different units. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the second approach. Let's recalculate:\n\nE = 938 MeV = 938e6 eV. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E = 938e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 938 *1.602e-13 J ≈ 1503e-13 J ≈ 1.503e-10 J.\n\nhc = 6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s = 1.9878e-25 J·m.\n\nlambda = hc / E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.503e-10 ≈ 1.322e-15 meters. Convert to cm: 1.322e-15 m * 100 cm/m = 1.322e-13 cm. So, 1.32e-13 cm. But this is different from the previous result of 2.1e-14 cm. There's a discrepancy here. Why?\n\nAh! Because in the first approach, using hc = 197.33 MeV·fm, which is a standard value in particle physics. Let me check that value. Yes, hc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. So, 197.33 MeV·fm is equal to 197.33e6 eV * 1e-15 m = 1.9733e-9 eV·m. But 1 eV·m = 1.602e-19 J·m. So, 1.9733e-9 eV·m = 1.9733e-9 *1.602e-19 = 3.16e-28 J·m. Wait, but hc is 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. So, there's a discrepancy here. Wait, no, because 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So, 1 MeV = 1e6 eV = 1.602e-13 J. So, 197.33 MeV·fm = 197.33e6 eV *1e-15 m = 197.33e6 *1.602e-19 J *1e-15 m = 197.33 *1.602e-28 J·m ≈ 316e-28 J·m = 3.16e-26 J·m. But hc is 1.9878e-25 J·m. So, there's a discrepancy. Therefore, the value of hc in MeV·fm must be calculated correctly. Let's compute hc in MeV·fm:\n\nh = 6.62607015e-34 J·s\n\nc = 299792458 m/s\n\nhc = 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 ≈ 1.98644586e-25 J·m\n\n1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J, so 1 J = 1 /1.602176634e-19 eV ≈ 6.241509e18 eV\n\nTherefore, hc = 1.98644586e-25 J·m * 6.241509e18 eV/J ≈ 1.23984198e-6 eV·m\n\nConvert to MeV·m: 1.23984198e-6 eV·m = 1.23984198e-12 MeV·m\n\nConvert meters to femtometers: 1 m = 1e15 fm, so hc = 1.23984198e-12 MeV·m *1e15 fm/m = 1.23984198e3 MeV·fm ≈ 1239.84 MeV·fm. Wait, but this contradicts the earlier statement that hc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. So, clearly, there's a mistake here. Wait, no, wait. Let me check again. Wait, 1.23984198e-6 eV·m is equal to 1.23984198e-6 eV·m. To convert to MeV·fm:\n\n1 MeV = 1e6 eV, so 1 eV = 1e-6 MeV.\n\n1 m = 1e15 fm.\n\nSo, hc = 1.23984198e-6 eV·m = 1.23984198e-6 *1e-6 MeV *1e15 fm = 1.23984198e-6 *1e9 MeV·fm = 1.23984198e3 MeV·fm ≈ 1239.84 MeV·fm. So, hc ≈ 1240 MeV·fm. But this contradicts the common value I thought was 197 MeV·fm. Wait, what's going on here. Oh! I think I confused ℏc with hc. Because in particle physics, often ℏ is used. Let me check. The reduced Planck constant ℏ = h/(2π). So, ℏc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. Let's compute ℏc. ℏ = h/(2π) ≈ 6.626e-34 /6.283 ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Then, ℏc = 1.0545718e-34 *3e8 ≈ 3.1637e-26 J·m. Convert to eV·m: 3.1637e-26 /1.602e-19 ≈ 1.975e-7 eV·m. Convert to MeV·fm: 1.975e-7 eV·m = 1.975e-7 eV *1e-6 MeV/eV *1e15 fm/m = 1.975e-7 *1e9 MeV·fm = 197.5 MeV·fm. So, ℏc ≈ 197.5 MeV·fm. Therefore, the correct value for ℏc is approximately 197.5 MeV·fm. But in the previous calculation, we were using hc, which is 2π times larger. So, the confusion arises between hc and ℏc. Therefore, when using the relation E = hc / lambda, we need to use hc. But in particle physics, the relation is often written using ℏc. Let me clarify.\n\nThe energy-wavelength relation is E = hc / lambda. But sometimes, people use E = (ℏ c)/lambda * 2π, which would be E = (2π ℏ c)/lambda = hc/lambda. So, yes, E = hc/lambda. Therefore, if we use hc = 1240 MeV·fm, then lambda = hc / E. For E = 938 MeV, lambda = 1240 /938 ≈1.322 fm. Which is 1.322e-15 meters = 1.322e-13 cm. Wait, that's 1.322e-13 cm. But earlier, using ℏc, we had lambda ≈0.2103 fm. Wait, this is confusing. Let me get this straight.\n\nIf E = hc / lambda, then lambda = hc / E. If hc is 1240 MeV·fm, then lambda in fm is 1240 / E (MeV). For E =938 MeV, lambda =1240 /938 ≈1.322 fm. Which is 1.322e-15 meters =1.322e-13 cm. But earlier, using ℏc, we had lambda = ℏc / E * something. Wait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nThe correct formula is E_photon = hc / lambda. Therefore, lambda = hc / E_photon. Given that hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm. Wait, but converting units:\n\n1 eV·nm = 1e-9 eV·m. So, hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm = 1240e-9 eV·m = 1.24e-6 eV·m. To convert to MeV·fm:\n\n1 MeV = 1e6 eV, 1 fm =1e-15 m. So, 1e6 eV *1e-15 m =1e-9 eV·m. Therefore, 1 MeV·fm =1e-9 eV·m. So, hc =1.24e-6 eV·m =1.24e-6 /1e-9 MeV·fm =1240 MeV·fm. Therefore, yes, hc =1240 MeV·fm. Therefore, lambda = hc / E =1240 MeV·fm /938 MeV ≈1.322 fm. Which is 1.322e-15 meters =1.322e-13 cm. So, the wavelength is approximately 1.32e-13 cm. But earlier, using ℏc, I got 0.2103 fm. Wait, that must have been a mistake. Because if we use E = ℏ c / lambda, then lambda = ℏc / E. But that's only if the energy is expressed as E = ℏ c / lambda. But the correct relation is E = hc / lambda. Therefore, using hc =1240 MeV·fm, lambda =1240 /938 ≈1.322 fm =1.322e-13 cm. So, the correct answer should be approximately 1.32e-13 cm. But earlier, when I used hc in J·m, I got 1.32e-13 cm, which matches this. Therefore, the correct wavelength is approximately 1.32e-13 cm. But why did the first approach using ℏc give a different answer? Because I mistakenly used ℏc instead of hc. So, the correct calculation uses hc =1240 MeV·fm, leading to lambda ≈1.32 fm =1.32e-13 cm. Therefore, part (d) answer is approximately 1.32e-13 cm. But let's compute it more precisely. 1240 /938 =1.322. So, 1.322 fm =1.322e-13 cm. So, the wavelength is 1.32e-13 cm. But the problem says \"led instead to 2 photons\", so each photon has energy 938 MeV, leading to wavelength 1.32e-13 cm. So, the answer is approximately 1.32e-13 cm. But let me check with exact numbers. If hc = 1240 MeV·fm exactly, then 1240 /938 =1.322. So, 1.322 fm =1.322e-13 cm. So, 1.32e-13 cm. So, written as 1.32 ×10^-13 cm. But the problem might expect the answer in a different unit or using a different value for hc. However, given standard values, this seems correct. So, part (d) answer is approximately 1.32e-13 cm. But let me check with the exact value of hc. If hc is 1239.84 MeV·fm, then 1239.84 /938 ≈1.322 fm. So, same result. Therefore, the wavelength is approximately 1.32e-13 cm. So, boxed answer would be \\boxed{1.32 \\times 10^{-13}} cm. But maybe the problem expects a different approach. Alternatively, if the annihilation occurs at rest, the two photons must have equal and opposite momenta, so each has energy E =938 MeV. Then, using E = hc/lambda, lambda = hc/E. As above. So, yes, the answer is 1.32e-13 cm. \n\nBut wait, 1.32e-13 cm is 1.32e-15 meters, which is 1.32 femtometers. Which is a very short wavelength, characteristic of gamma rays. So, this makes sense. Therefore, part (d) answer is 1.32e-13 cm. \n\nTo summarize:\n\n(a) Average kinetic energy per pion: 329 MeV\n\n(b) Momentum: ~448 MeV/c\n\n(c) Velocity: ~0.954c\n\n(d) Wavelength: ~1.32e-13 cm\n\nI need to check if my calculations for each part are correct. Let me go through each part again quickly.\n\nPart (a): Total energy from proton and antiproton at rest: 2*938=1876 MeV. Four pions, each 140 MeV rest energy: 4*140=560. So, KE total=1876-560=1316. Average per pion=1316/4=329. Correct.\n\nPart (b): For each pion, E=140+329=469 MeV. Using E²=(pc)² + (mc²)². So, pc= sqrt(469² -140²)=sqrt(200361)=approx 447.6 MeV. So, p=447.6 MeV/c. Rounded to three significant figures, 448 MeV/c. Correct.\n\nPart (c): v = (pc²)/E *c. Wait, no. From p=gamma m v and E=gamma m c². So, p/E = v/(c²). Therefore, v= (pc²)/E. But p is in MeV/c, E in MeV. So, v= (p c²)/E * c? Wait, let's clarify units. p is MeV/c. E is MeV. So, p*c is MeV. Then, (p*c)/E = (MeV)/MeV = dimensionless. So, v= (p*c²)/E *c? Wait, no. Let's re-express:\n\np = gamma m v\n\nE = gamma m c²\n\nDivide p by E: p/E = v/(c²)\n\nMultiply both sides by c²: v = (p c²)/E\n\nBut p is in MeV/c, c is in (m/s), but units need to cancel. Alternatively, in natural units where c=1, p is in MeV/c, so p*c is MeV. Then, v = (p*c)/E. Because in natural units, p*c has units of MeV, E is in MeV. So, v = (p*c)/E. Since v is in units of c, then v = (p*c)/E. For example, if p*c = E, then v=1c. So, yes, v = (p*c)/E. Therefore, in our case, p=447.6 MeV/c. So, p*c=447.6 MeV. E=469 MeV. So, v=447.6/469 ≈0.954c. Correct.\n\nPart (d): As above, wavelength is 1.32e-13 cm. Correct.\n\nSo, all steps seem correct. Therefore, the answers are:\n\n(a) 329 MeV\n\n(b) 448 MeV/c\n\n(c) 0.954c\n\n(d) 1.32e-13 cm\n</think>\n\n(a) The total rest energy of the proton and antiproton is \\(2 \\times 938 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876 \\, \\text{MeV}\\).

{"id": "atomic/4-33", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the mass difference between a neutron and a hydrogen atom (which is a proton plus an electron, right?) using the given Q-value of the helium-3 neutron capture reaction and the maximum beta energy from tritium. Hmm. Let me start by recalling some nuclear reactions and mass-energy equivalence.\n\nFirst, the reaction given is ${}^3\\text{He}(n,p)$. So, when a neutron is absorbed by helium-3, it produces a proton and... what's the other product? Let me balance the reaction. The initial nuclei are helium-3 (which has 2 protons and 1 neutron) and a neutron. So total protons: 2, neutrons: 1 + 1 = 2. After the reaction, we have a proton (so charge +1) and the remaining nucleus must have charge 2 - 1 = 1, which would be tritium, hydrogen-3. So the reaction is ${}^3\\text{He} + n \\rightarrow {}^3\\text{H} + p$. Got it.\n\nThe Q-value is the energy released, which is the difference in mass between the reactants and products multiplied by c². So Q = (mass_reactants - mass_products) * c². Since they give Q as 0.770 MeV, and 1 amu = 931 MeV, maybe I can express the mass difference in terms of amu.\n\nBut the question is about the mass difference between the neutron and hydrogen atom. A hydrogen atom is a proton plus an electron. Wait, but in nuclear reactions, sometimes we use atomic masses which include electrons. Let me think. The mass difference between the neutron and the hydrogen atom (which is a proton plus an electron) would be (mass_n - mass_H). Since a hydrogen atom has a proton and an electron, mass_H = mass_p + mass_e - binding energy (but maybe binding energy is negligible here). So approximately, mass_n - mass_H ≈ mass_n - (mass_p + mass_e). But maybe I need to get this difference using the given data.\n\nAlso, the maximum kinetic energy of beta particles from tritium is 0.018 MeV. Tritium undergoes beta decay: ${}^3\\text{H} \\rightarrow {}^3\\text{He} + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e$. The maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle (electron) occurs when the antineutrino gets negligible energy, so the entire Q-value is given to the electron. But the Q-value here would be the mass difference between tritium and helium-3 (since the electron mass is accounted for in the decay). Wait, the Q-value for the beta decay is equal to the mass difference between the parent (tritium) and the daughter (helium-3) minus the electron mass, but maybe I need to think in terms of atomic masses.\n\nWait, the beta decay of tritium is: ${}^3\\text{H} \\rightarrow {}^3\\text{He}^+ + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e$. But if we consider atomic masses, the tritium atom has one electron, and the helium-3 ion would have one less electron. So the atomic mass difference would be mass(³H) - [mass(³He) + mass_e]. But maybe the Q-value is (mass_parent - mass_daughter) * c², but considering that the daughter is an ion. Hmm. Alternatively, the maximum beta energy is given as 0.018 MeV. So the Q-value of the beta decay is approximately 0.018 MeV? Wait, no. The maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle is equal to the Q-value when the neutrino carries away no energy. So Q_beta = max KE_beta = 0.018 MeV. Therefore, the mass difference between tritium and helium-3 (accounting for the electron) is Q_beta = [mass(³H) - mass(³He) - mass_e] * c² = 0.018 MeV. So mass(³H) - mass(³He) - mass_e = 0.018 MeV / c². But since we are dealing with atomic masses, maybe the electrons are already included. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me write down the equations step by step.\n\nFirst, let's handle the first reaction: ${}^3\\text{He} + n \\rightarrow {}^3\\text{H} + p$. The Q-value is given by:\n\nQ = [mass(³He) + mass_n - mass(³H) - mass_p] * c² = 0.770 MeV.\n\nSo rearranged:\n\nmass(³He) + mass_n - mass(³H) - mass_p = 0.770 MeV / c² per amu conversion. Wait, but 1 amu = 931 MeV/c². So converting 0.770 MeV to amu: 0.770 / 931 ≈ 0.000826 amu.\n\nSo:\n\nmass(³He) + mass_n - mass(³H) - mass_p = 0.000826 amu. Let's call this equation (1).\n\nNow, the second part is the beta decay of tritium: ${}^3\\text{H} \\rightarrow {}^3\\text{He} + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e$. The maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle is 0.018 MeV. The Q-value here is the total energy released, which is the mass difference between tritium and the products (helium-3, electron, and neutrino). But since the neutrino's mass is negligible and it can carry away energy, the maximum kinetic energy of the electron is when the neutrino gets zero. So Q_beta = [mass(³H) - mass(³He) - mass_e] * c² = 0.018 MeV.\n\nTherefore:\n\nmass(³H) - mass(³He) - mass_e = 0.018 / 931 amu ≈ 0.018 / 931 ≈ 0.0000193 amu. Let's call this equation (2).\n\nBut we need to find the mass difference between neutron and hydrogen atom, which is mass_n - mass_H. Since hydrogen atom is a proton plus an electron (ignoring binding energy, which is small), mass_H ≈ mass_p + mass_e. Therefore, mass_n - mass_H ≈ mass_n - mass_p - mass_e. So our target is (mass_n - mass_p - mass_e) in amu.\n\nLooking at equations (1) and (2), perhaps we can combine them to get this difference.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\nmass(³He) + mass_n = mass(³H) + mass_p + 0.000826 amu.\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\nmass(³H) = mass(³He) + mass_e + 0.0000193 amu.\n\nSubstitute equation (2) into equation (1):\n\nmass(³He) + mass_n = [mass(³He) + mass_e + 0.0000193 amu] + mass_p + 0.000826 amu.\n\nSimplify:\n\nmass(³He) + mass_n = mass(³He) + mass_e + 0.0000193 + mass_p + 0.000826.\n\nCancel mass(³He) on both sides:\n\nmass_n = mass_e + mass_p + 0.0000193 + 0.000826.\n\nCombine the constants:\n\n0.0000193 + 0.000826 = 0.0008453 amu.\n\nTherefore:\n\nmass_n = mass_p + mass_e + 0.0008453 amu.\n\nRearranged:\n\nmass_n - mass_p - mass_e = 0.0008453 amu.\n\nBut mass_n - (mass_p + mass_e) is exactly the mass difference between the neutron and the hydrogen atom. Therefore, the mass difference is approximately 0.0008453 amu. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nFirst, converting Q-values to amu:\n\nFor the first reaction: 0.770 MeV / 931 MeV/amu ≈ 0.770 / 931 ≈ 0.000826 amu.\n\nFor the beta decay: 0.018 MeV / 931 ≈ 0.0000193 amu.\n\nAdding those two: 0.000826 + 0.0000193 = 0.0008453 amu.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the mass difference between the neutron and hydrogen atom is approximately 0.0008453 amu. Let me check if there's a more precise way, but given the data, this should be the answer. So boxed, it would be approximately 0.000845 amu. But let me check the exact numbers.\n\n0.770 / 931 = 0.770 ÷ 931. Let's compute that:\n\n931 × 0.0008 = 0.7448, so 0.770 - 0.7448 = 0.0252. Then 0.0252 / 931 ≈ 0.00002706. So total 0.0008 + 0.00002706 ≈ 0.00082706 amu.\n\nSimilarly, 0.018 / 931 ≈ 0.00001933 amu.\n\nAdding them: 0.00082706 + 0.00001933 ≈ 0.0008464 amu. So approximately 0.000846 amu. Rounding to three decimal places would be 0.00085 amu, but maybe the answer expects more precise. Let me check the exact calculation.\n\n0.770 / 931 = 0.770 ÷ 931. Let's compute this division:\n\n931 × 0.0008 = 0.7448\n\n0.770 - 0.7448 = 0.0252\n\nNow, 0.0252 / 931 = 0.0000270677\n\nSo total is 0.0008 + 0.0000270677 ≈ 0.0008270677 amu.\n\nSimilarly, 0.018 / 931 = 0.018 ÷ 931 ≈ 0.0000193337 amu.\n\nAdding these two: 0.0008270677 + 0.0000193337 ≈ 0.0008464014 amu.\n\nSo approximately 0.0008464 amu. Rounding to four significant figures, since the given Q-values are three significant figures (0.770 is three, 0.018 is two). Wait, 0.770 has three, 0.018 has two. The least number of significant figures is two in 0.018, but when adding, the decimal places matter. The first term is 0.00082707 (approx 0.0008271) with four decimal places, the second is 0.00001933 with five decimal places. Adding them gives 0.00084640, which is 0.0008464 amu. So three decimal places? Wait, 0.0008464 is 8.464 × 10^-4 amu. So maybe the answer is 0.000846 amu, but perhaps the problem expects rounding to three decimal places as 0.00085 amu. Wait, but 0.0008464 is approximately 0.000846 amu. Let me check if the problem expects the answer in a certain way. The given data uses 0.770 (three sig figs) and 0.018 (two sig figs). The result would have two sig figs? Because the 0.018 has two. But when adding, the uncertainty is dominated by the least precise term. Hmm. Let's see:\n\nThe first term is 0.770 / 931 = 0.000827 amu (three sig figs)\n\nSecond term is 0.018 / 931 = 0.0000193 amu (two sig figs)\n\nAdding them: 0.000827 + 0.0000193 = 0.0008463. The first term is known to three decimal places (0.000827), the second to four (0.0000193). The sum would be 0.000846, which is three decimal places. But in terms of significant figures, the first term is 8.27 × 10^-4 (three sig figs), the second is 1.93 × 10^-5 (three sig figs if 0.0000193 is written as three, but original 0.018 is two sig figs). Wait, the original beta energy is 0.018 MeV, which is two sig figs. So 0.018 / 931 = 0.0000193 (but since 0.018 is two sig figs, this term is 1.9 × 10^-5). So the second term is 0.000019 (two sig figs). Then adding 0.000827 (three sig figs) + 0.000019 (two sig figs) = 0.000846. The result should have two decimal places in the fifth position, but since we are dealing with two sig figs in the second term, maybe the answer should be 0.00085 amu (rounded to two sig figs). Wait, 0.000846 is approximately 0.00085 when rounded to two significant figures. Because 0.000846 is 8.46 × 10^-4, which is 0.000846. The first two significant figures are 8 and 4. The third is 6, which would round the 4 up to 5. So 0.00085 amu. But the problem says \"calculate the mass difference...\", and given the input data, maybe we should keep three significant figures. Wait, the Q-value for the first reaction is 0.770 MeV (three sig figs), the beta energy is 0.018 MeV (two sig figs). When combining these, the result's precision is limited by the least precise measurement, which is two sig figs. Therefore, the answer should be 0.00085 amu (rounded to two sig figs). But let me check the exact calculation again. 0.770 / 931 = 0.0008270677 amu (approx 0.0008271), 0.018 / 931 = 0.0000193337 amu (approx 0.00001933). Sum is 0.0008464014 amu. So 0.0008464 amu. If we round to three significant figures, it's 0.000846 amu. If to two, 0.00085 amu. But the problem might expect three significant figures because the first Q-value is three. However, since the second term is two, maybe the answer is two. Let me check standard practice. When adding or subtracting, the number of decimal places is determined by the least precise term. The first term is 0.0008271 (four decimal places), the second is 0.0000193 (five decimal places). The sum is 0.0008464, which has four decimal places. But in terms of significant figures, 0.0008464 has four significant figures (8, 4, 6, 4). But the original data: 0.770 has three, 0.018 has two. So the answer should have two significant figures. Therefore, 0.00085 amu. But wait, 0.0008464 is 0.00085 when rounded to two significant figures. Yes, because the third digit is 6, which rounds up the second digit (4) to 5. So 0.00085 amu. But let me check with exact numbers. 0.770 / 931 = 0.770 / 931 ≈ 0.00082685. 0.018 / 931 ≈ 0.00001933. Sum ≈ 0.00084618 amu. So approximately 0.000846 amu. If we write this as 8.46 × 10^-4 amu, then with three significant figures, it's 8.46e-4. But if the problem expects two, it's 8.5e-4. However, the problem states \"calculate the mass difference...\", and given that the two given values have three and two sig figs, perhaps the answer should be given to two significant figures. But maybe the answer is expected to be precise with three. Let me check the exact calculation once more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 0.000846 amu, and the problem expects three significant figures. Let me see. The Q-values are 0.770 (three) and 0.018 (two). The calculation involves both. The result is a combination of these two. The first term is 0.770 / 931 ≈ 0.000827 (three sig figs), the second term is 0.018 / 931 ≈ 0.0000193 (two sig figs). When adding, the uncertainty is dominated by the term with fewer sig figs. So the result should have two sig figs. Therefore, 0.00085 amu. But when I compute the exact sum, it's approximately 0.000846, which is closer to 0.00085 when rounded to two sig figs. So the answer is 0.00085 amu. But let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the exact sum without rounding during the steps. Let's compute everything more precisely.\n\nFirst, Q1 = 0.770 MeV. Convert to amu: 0.770 / 931 = 0.000826854 amu (exact division).\n\nQ2 = 0.018 MeV. Convert to amu: 0.018 / 931 = 0.00001933405 amu.\n\nSum: 0.000826854 + 0.00001933405 = 0.000846188 amu.\n\nSo approximately 0.0008462 amu. If we round to three significant figures, it's 0.000846 amu. If to two, 0.00085 amu. The problem might expect three, given that one of the inputs has three. However, the second input has two, so the answer should have two. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me see if there's another way to cross-validate.\n\nAlternatively, the known mass difference between neutron and hydrogen atom is approximately 0.00084 amu. For example, the neutron mass is about 1.008664 amu, hydrogen atom is about 1.007825 amu. The difference is 0.000839 amu. So the calculation here gives 0.000846, which is close. Considering that, maybe the answer is 0.00084 amu. But the exact calculation here gives 0.000846, which is 0.00085 when rounded to two sig figs. But the known value is about 0.00084. Hmm. Maybe there's a mistake in the reasoning.\n\nWait, let's check the known masses. Neutron mass: 1.008664 amu. Hydrogen atom (¹H): 1.007825 amu. Difference: 1.008664 - 1.007825 = 0.000839 amu. So approximately 0.00084 amu. Our calculation here gives 0.000846, which is a bit higher. But given the problem's data, perhaps the answer is 0.000846 amu. But why the discrepancy? Maybe because the actual Q-values used in the problem are different from real values. For example, in reality, the Q-value of the ${}^3\\text{He}(n,p)$ reaction is different, but in this problem, it's given as 0.770 MeV. Similarly, the maximum beta energy for tritium is given as 0.018 MeV, which is correct (actual value is about 18.6 keV). So using the given data, the answer should be 0.000846 amu, which rounds to 0.00085 amu with two sig figs. But the known value is 0.00084. However, since this is a problem based on given data, not real-world values, we should go with the calculation here.\n\nTherefore, the mass difference is approximately 0.000846 amu. The problem might expect the answer in three significant figures, so 0.000846 amu. But given the input data has two sig figs in the beta decay energy, maybe it's 0.00085 amu. However, the exact sum is 0.000846188 amu. If we write this as 0.000846 amu, that's three sig figs. If the problem allows three, that's better. But since 0.018 has two, maybe the answer should be two. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Let me check the problem statement again. It says \"calculate the mass difference...\", and gives 1 amu = 931 MeV. So they probably want the precise value from the given numbers, regardless of sig figs. Therefore, the exact value is 0.770/931 + 0.018/931 = (0.770 + 0.018)/931 = 0.788/931 ≈ 0.000846 amu. Wait, wait! Wait a minute. Is that correct? Because the two terms are added in the equations. Wait, no. Let me go back.\n\nFrom the two equations:\n\nFrom reaction 1: mass(³He) + mass_n = mass(³H) + mass_p + 0.770/931.\n\nFrom reaction 2: mass(³H) = mass(³He) + mass_e + 0.018/931.\n\nSubstitute equation 2 into equation 1:\n\nmass(³He) + mass_n = [mass(³He) + mass_e + 0.018/931] + mass_p + 0.770/931.\n\nThen:\n\nmass_n = mass_e + mass_p + (0.018 + 0.770)/931.\n\nSo the total is (0.770 + 0.018) = 0.788 MeV. Therefore, 0.788 / 931 ≈ 0.000846 amu. Ah, that's a better way to see it. So the mass difference is (0.770 + 0.018) MeV / 931 MeV/amu = 0.788 / 931 ≈ 0.000846 amu. Therefore, the answer is 0.000846 amu. So boxed, that would be \\boxed{0.000846} amu. But let me compute 0.788 divided by 931 exactly.\n\n0.788 ÷ 931:\n\n931 × 0.0008 = 0.7448\n\n0.788 - 0.7448 = 0.0432\n\n0.0432 ÷ 931 ≈ 0.0000464\n\nSo total is 0.0008 + 0.0000464 = 0.0008464 amu. So approximately 0.000846 amu. Therefore, the answer is 0.000846 amu, which is 0.000846. So boxed as \\boxed{0.000846} amu. But maybe the problem expects it in a certain number of decimal places or significant figures. Given that the sum of the two Q-values is 0.788 MeV, which is three significant figures (0.770 + 0.018 = 0.788; three sig figs), then dividing by 931 (three sig figs) gives 0.788/931 = 0.000846 (three sig figs). Therefore, the answer is 0.000846 amu, boxed as such.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate the mass difference between a neutron and a hydrogen atom (¹H), we use the given Q-values of the nuclear reactions and convert them to mass differences using \\(1 \\, \\text{amu} = 931 \\, \\text{MeV}\\).\n\n1. **Reaction 1**: \\({}^3\\text{He} + n \\rightarrow {}^3\\text{H} + p\\)  \n   Q-value: \\(0.770 \\, \\text{MeV}\\)  \n   Convert to mass difference:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{0.770 \\, \\text{MeV}}{931 \\, \\text{MeV/amu}} \\approx 0.000826 \\, \\text{amu}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Reaction 2**: \\({}^3\\text{H} \\rightarrow {}^3\\text{He} + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e\\)  \n   Maximum beta energy (Q-value): \\(0.018 \\, \\text{MeV}\\)  \n   Convert to mass difference:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{0.018 \\, \\text{MeV}}{931 \\, \\text{MeV/amu}} \\approx 0.0000193 \\, \\text{amu}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results**:  \n   The total mass difference from both reactions is:  \n   \\[\n   0.000826 \\, \\text{amu} + 0.0000193 \\, \\text{amu} = 0.0008453 \\, \\text{amu}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final calculation**:  \n   The mass difference between the neutron and hydrogen atom (¹H) is the sum of the converted Q-values:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{0.770 + 0.018}{931} \\, \\text{amu} = \\frac{0.788}{931} \\, \\text{amu} \\approx 0.000846 \\, \\text{amu}\n   \\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.000846}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["0.000846", "0.000846", "0.000846"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "0.000846", "expr2": "8.46 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{amu}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "0.000846", "expr2": "8.46 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{amu}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "0.000846", "expr2": "8.46 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{amu}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/3-24", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the ratios of the decay rates for the Sigma^0(1915) baryon decaying into different channels: K^- p, K^0 n, pi^- p, and pi^+ pi^-. The problem gives that the Sigma^0 has isospin I=1 and I_3=0. The masses are such that all decays are possible, and mass splitting within isospin multiplets can be ignored. \n\nFirst, I remember that decay rates for particles related by isospin symmetry can be determined using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The general idea is that the amplitude for a decay process is proportional to the isospin Clebsch-Gordan coefficient connecting the initial and final states. Then, the decay rate, which is proportional to the square of the amplitude, would be proportional to the square of these coefficients. So, the ratios of the decay rates should be the squares of the ratios of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nThe Sigma^0 has I=1, I3=0. Let's consider each decay channel one by one.\n\n1. Decay to K^- p: The Sigma^0 (I=1, I3=0) decays into K^- and p. I need to figure out the isospin states of K^- and p.\n\nKaons (K) are part of the pseudoscalar mesons. The K^- is a member of the I=1/2 isospin multiplet. Specifically, the K^+ is in the (I=1/2, I3=+1/2) state, and K^0 is (I=1/2, I3=-1/2). But wait, actually, the anti-K mesons (like K^-) are in a different multiplet. The K^- is the antiparticle of K^+, so it's in the anti-multiplet. The anti-multiplet of I=1/2 would have K^- as (I=1/2, I3=+1/2) and anti-K^0 as (I=1/2, I3=-1/2). Wait, maybe I need to check that. Let me recall: the quark content. K^+ is u s-bar, K^0 is d s-bar. Their antiparticles are K^- (s u-bar) and K^0-bar (s d-bar). So the K^- and K^0-bar form an I=1/2 multiplet. So K^- has I=1/2, I3=+1/2? Wait, no. Let me think again. The standard assignment is that for the pseudoscalar mesons, the quark content determines the isospin. The K^+ (u s-bar) and K^0 (d s-bar) form an isospin doublet with I=1/2, where K^+ has I3=+1/2 and K^0 has I3=-1/2. Then their antiparticles, K^- (s u-bar) and K^0-bar (s d-bar), would form another doublet, but with I=1/2 as well. However, the antiparticle of a (I=1/2, I3=+1/2) state is (I=1/2, I3=-1/2) in the conjugate representation. Wait, maybe I need to be careful here. The antiparticle of a particle in the (I=1/2, I3=+1/2) state would be in the (I=1/2, I3=-1/2) state. So the K^- is part of the anti-K doublet. So the K^- would have I=1/2, I3=-1/2? Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the K^- and K^0-bar are in an I=1/2 multiplet with K^- having I3=+1/2 and K^0-bar having I3=-1/2. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me check a standard reference. For the pseudoscalar mesons, the quark content is:\n\n- Pions: π^+ (u d-bar), π^0 ( (u u-bar - d d-bar)/sqrt(2) ), π^- (d u-bar)\n- Kaons: K^+ (u s-bar), K^0 (d s-bar)\n- Anti-K: K^- (s u-bar), K^0-bar (s d-bar)\n- Eta and eta' are singlets.\n\nSo the K^+ and K^0 form an isospin doublet with I=1/2, where K^+ has I3=+1/2 and K^0 has I3=-1/2. Similarly, the anti-K's (K^- and K^0-bar) form another doublet, but since they are antiparticles, their isospin assignments might be different. The antiparticle of a (I=1/2, I3=+1/2) state is (I=1/2, I3=-1/2). Therefore, K^- (which is the antiparticle of K^+) would be in the (I=1/2, I3=-1/2) state, and K^0-bar (antiparticle of K^0) would be (I=1/2, I3=+1/2). Wait, but that seems contradictory. Alternatively, perhaps the anti-K's are in a different doublet. Let me think of the isospin transformation properties. The quark content of K^- is s u-bar. The u-bar is in the anti-fundamental representation of SU(2), so the isospin of K^- would be similar to a (u-bar s) combination. But maybe it's better to consider the anti-K's as a separate doublet. Let me refer to the standard isospin assignments.\n\nIn the standard model, the K^- and K^0-bar are considered as an isospin doublet with I=1/2. The K^- is assigned I3=+1/2, and K^0-bar is I3=-1/2. Wait, that might be the case. Let me check: if we consider the quark content, K^- is s u-bar. The s quark is an isosinglet (since it's a strange quark, which is not part of the up and down isospin). Wait, no. Wait, the isospin is only for the up and down quarks. The strange quark has isospin I=0. Therefore, the K^+ is u s-bar: the u quark has I=1/2, I3=+1/2, and the s-bar is I=0. Therefore, the K^+ has total I=1/2, I3=+1/2. Similarly, K^0 is d s-bar: d quark has I=1/2, I3=-1/2, so K^0 has I=1/2, I3=-1/2. Therefore, the K^+ and K^0 form an I=1/2 doublet. Their antiparticles, K^- (s u-bar) and K^0-bar (s d-bar), would then form another I=1/2 doublet. However, since the s quark is I=0, the anti-u (in K^-) has I=1/2, I3=-1/2 (since the antiparticle of u is anti-u with I3=-1/2). Similarly, anti-d (in K^0-bar) has I3=+1/2. Therefore, the K^- would be made of s (I=0) and anti-u (I=1/2, I3=-1/2). So the total isospin of K^- would be I=1/2, I3=-1/2. Similarly, K^0-bar is s anti-d, which is I=1/2, I3=+1/2. Therefore, the anti-K doublet (K^-, K^0-bar) has I=1/2, with K^- having I3=-1/2 and K^0-bar having I3=+1/2. Wait, but this seems conflicting with the standard assignments. Maybe I need to recall that the anti-particle of a (I, I3) state is (I, -I3). So if K^+ is (1/2, +1/2), then its antiparticle K^- is (1/2, -1/2). Similarly, K^0 is (1/2, -1/2), so K^0-bar is (1/2, +1/2). Therefore, the anti-K's (K^- and K^0-bar) form an I=1/2 doublet with I3=-1/2 and +1/2 respectively. So when considering the decay products, for example, K^- has I=1/2, I3=-1/2.\n\nSimilarly, the proton (p) is part of the nucleon doublet: p has I=1/2, I3=+1/2, and n (neutron) has I=1/2, I3=-1/2.\n\nSo, for the decay Sigma^0 (I=1, I3=0) -> K^- + p. Let's write the isospin states. The Sigma^0 is in the state |1, 0>. The final state is K^- (|1/2, -1/2>) and p (|1/2, +1/2>). The total isospin of the final state is a combination of the two I=1/2 states. To find the amplitude, we need to decompose the product of the two I=1/2 states into total isospin states. The product of two I=1/2 states can give I=1 and I=0. The Sigma^0 has I=1, so the decay amplitude would be proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining the two I=1/2 states into an I=1, I3=0 state.\n\nWait, but the initial state is Sigma^0 with I=1, I3=0. The final state is K^- (I=1/2, I3=-1/2) and p (I=1/2, I3=+1/2). The total I3 of the final state is (-1/2) + (+1/2) = 0, which matches the initial I3=0. So the total isospin of the final state can be either I=1 (since 1/2 ⊗ 1/2 = 1 ⊕ 0) with I3=0, or I=0 with I3=0. The Sigma^0 has I=1, so the decay must proceed through the I=1 component of the final state. Therefore, the amplitude is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <1/2, -1/2; 1/2, +1/2 | 1, 0>.\n\nLet me compute that coefficient. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two I=1/2 states into I=1 and I=0. The state |1,0> can be written as a combination of the product states. The general formula is:\n\n|I=1, I3=0> = ( |1/2, +1/2> ⊗ |1/2, -1/2> + |1/2, -1/2> ⊗ |1/2, +1/2> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nWait, no. Wait, when combining two spin-1/2 particles, the triplet (I=1) states are:\n\n|1, +1> = |1/2, +1/2> ⊗ |1/2, +1/2>\n\n|1, 0> = (|1/2, +1/2> ⊗ |1/2, -1/2> + |1/2, -1/2> ⊗ |1/2, +1/2> ) / sqrt(2)\n\n|1, -1> = |1/2, -1/2> ⊗ |1/2, -1/2>\n\nBut in our case, the two particles are K^- (I=1/2, I3=-1/2) and p (I=1/2, I3=+1/2). So the product state is |1/2, -1/2>_K ⊗ |1/2, +1/2>_p. To express this in terms of total isospin states, we can write:\n\n|1/2, -1/2>_K ⊗ |1/2, +1/2>_p = sum_{I=0,1} <I, 0 | 1/2, -1/2; 1/2, +1/2> |I, 0>\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for I=1, I3=0 is <1,0 | 1/2, -1/2; 1/2, +1/2> = 1/sqrt(2), as per the formula above. Similarly, the coefficient for I=0, I3=0 is <0,0 | 1/2, -1/2; 1/2, +1/2> = 1/sqrt(2) but with a sign depending on convention. Wait, actually, the singlet state (I=0) is:\n\n|0, 0> = ( |1/2, +1/2> ⊗ |1/2, -1/2> - |1/2, -1/2> ⊗ |1/2, +1/2> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nTherefore, the product state |1/2, -1/2> ⊗ |1/2, +1/2> can be written as ( |1,0> + |0,0> ) / sqrt(2). Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nIf we have two particles A and B with states |m_A> and |m_B>, then the total state |m_A, m_B> can be decomposed into total I states. For m_A + m_B = 0, which is our case ( -1/2 + 1/2 = 0 ), the decomposition is:\n\n|1/2, -1/2>_A ⊗ |1/2, +1/2>_B = ( |1,0> + |0,0> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nWait, actually, the coefficients are such that:\n\n|1,0> = ( |+1/2, -1/2> + |-1/2, +1/2> ) / sqrt(2)\n\n|0,0> = ( |+1/2, -1/2> - |-1/2, +1/2> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nTherefore, solving for |+1/2, -1/2> (which is the same as |1/2, +1/2>_A ⊗ |1/2, -1/2>_B) and |-1/2, +1/2> (which is |1/2, -1/2>_A ⊗ |1/2, +1/2>_B):\n\nAdding the two equations:\n\n|1,0> + |0,0> = [ ( |+1/2, -1/2> + |-1/2, +1/2> ) + ( |+1/2, -1/2> - |-1/2, +1/2> ) ] / sqrt(2) = 2 |+1/2, -1/2> / sqrt(2) => |+1/2, -1/2> = ( |1,0> + |0,0> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSimilarly, subtracting:\n\n|1,0> - |0,0> = 2 |-1/2, +1/2> / sqrt(2) => |-1/2, +1/2> = ( |1,0> - |0,0> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nBut in our case, the product state is |-1/2, +1/2> (since K^- has I3=-1/2 and p has I3=+1/2). So this state is equal to ( |1,0> - |0,0> ) / sqrt(2). Therefore, the amplitude for the Sigma^0 (I=1, I3=0) decaying into K^- p is proportional to the overlap with the |1,0> component, which is 1/sqrt(2). Therefore, the amplitude is proportional to 1/sqrt(2), and the decay rate (which is the square of the amplitude) is proportional to (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2. Wait, but the Sigma^0 has isospin I=1, so the decay must go through the I=1 channel. Therefore, the amplitude is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <1,0 | 1/2, -1/2; 1/2, +1/2> which is 1/sqrt(2). Therefore, the amplitude for this decay is proportional to 1/sqrt(2), so the rate Gamma_{K^- p} is proportional to (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.\n\nBut wait, the overall proportionality constant might include other factors like phase space, but the problem states to disregard mass splitting, so we can assume phase space factors are the same for all these decays. Therefore, the rates are determined purely by the isospin Clebsch-Gordan coefficients squared. So Gamma_{K^- p} ~ |CG|^2 = 1/2.\n\nNow, let's consider the decay Sigma^0 -> K^0 n. The K^0 is d s-bar, which as part of the K^0 and K^+ doublet, but wait, the K^0 here is the anti-K^0? Wait, the decay is to K^0 n. Wait, the K^0 is part of the same doublet as K^+ (I=1/2, I3=-1/2). But the anti-K^0 is part of the anti-K doublet. Wait, the decay product is K^0 n. Let's check the isospin of K^0 and n.\n\nThe K^0 has quark content d s-bar, so as part of the I=1/2 doublet with I3=-1/2. The neutron (n) is part of the nucleon doublet with I=1/2, I3=-1/2. So the final state is K^0 (I=1/2, I3=-1/2) and n (I=1/2, I3=-1/2). The total I3 is (-1/2) + (-1/2) = -1. But the initial Sigma^0 has I3=0. This seems problematic. Wait, that can't be. If the decay is Sigma^0 -> K^0 n, then the total I3 of the final state must be 0 (since Sigma^0 has I3=0). But K^0 has I3=-1/2 and n has I3=-1/2, so total I3=-1. That's a problem. Therefore, this decay would violate isospin conservation. But the problem states that all these decays are kinematically possible, so maybe I made a mistake in the isospin assignments.\n\nWait, the decay is Sigma^0 -> \\bar{K}^0 n. The user wrote \\bar{K}^0 n. So the decay is to anti-K^0 and neutron. Let's correct that. The \\bar{K}^0 is s d-bar (quark content), which is part of the anti-K doublet (I=1/2, I3=+1/2). The neutron has I=1/2, I3=-1/2. So the total I3 of the final state is (+1/2) + (-1/2) = 0, which matches the initial I3=0. Therefore, the decay Sigma^0 -> \\bar{K}^0 n is allowed in terms of I3 conservation.\n\nSo the final state is \\bar{K}^0 (I=1/2, I3=+1/2) and n (I=1/2, I3=-1/2). The product state is |1/2, +1/2>_Kbar ⊗ |1/2, -1/2>_n. The total isospin of this state can be decomposed into I=1 and I=0. The Sigma^0 has I=1, so the amplitude is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining these two I=1/2 states into an I=1, I3=0 state.\n\nSimilarly to the previous case, the product state is |1/2, +1/2> ⊗ |1/2, -1/2>. As before, this can be written as ( |1,0> + |0,0> ) / sqrt(2). Wait, no. Wait, when combining |1/2, +1/2> and |1/2, -1/2>, the decomposition is:\n\n|1/2, +1/2> ⊗ |1/2, -1/2> = ( |1,0> + |0,0> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nBut in our case, the product state is |1/2, +1/2> (for \\bar{K}^0) and |1/2, -1/2> (for n). So the same as the previous case but with the particles in a different order. However, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are the same regardless of the order, except possibly for a phase. But since we're squaring the amplitude, the phase won't matter. Therefore, the amplitude for Sigma^0 -> \\bar{K}^0 n is proportional to the same Clebsch-Gordan coefficient as before, 1/sqrt(2), leading to a decay rate proportional to 1/2. Therefore, the ratio Gamma_{Kbar^0 n} / Gamma_{K^- p} would be (1/2) / (1/2) = 1. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, in the first decay (K^- p), the product state was |1/2, -1/2> ⊗ |1/2, +1/2>, which decomposed into ( |1,0> - |0,0> ) / sqrt(2). The amplitude for the Sigma^0 (I=1) decay is the coefficient of |1,0>, which is 1/sqrt(2). Similarly, in the second decay (Kbar^0 n), the product state is |1/2, +1/2> ⊗ |1/2, -1/2>, which decomposes into ( |1,0> + |0,0> ) / sqrt(2). Therefore, the amplitude is also 1/sqrt(2). Therefore, the decay rates for both K^- p and Kbar^0 n are proportional to (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2. Therefore, their ratio is 1. So the first ratio Gamma_{Kbar^0 n} / Gamma_{K^- p} is 1.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive. Let me check again. The Sigma^0 has I=1, I3=0. The decay to K^- p and Kbar^0 n both have final states that can couple to I=1, I3=0. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for both processes are the same, so their rates should be equal. Therefore, the ratio is 1. That makes sense because the Sigma^0 is part of an isospin triplet (I=1), and the two decay channels are related by isospin symmetry. Therefore, their decay rates should be the same. So the first ratio is 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the second decay: Sigma^0 -> pi^- p. The pion has isospin I=1. The pi^- is I=1, I3=-1. The proton is I=1/2, I3=+1/2. So the final state is pi^- (I=1, I3=-1) and p (I=1/2, I3=+1/2). The total I3 is -1 + 1/2 = -1/2. But the initial Sigma^0 has I3=0. Therefore, this decay would violate isospin conservation. Wait, but the problem states that all these decays are possible. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the problem says to disregard the small mass splitting within an isospin multiplet, but the decay must still conserve isospin. If the decay Sigma^0 -> pi^- p has a total I3 of -1/2, which doesn't match the initial I3=0, then this decay would be forbidden by isospin symmetry. However, the problem states that all these decays are kinematically possible, so perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the pion is part of an I=1 triplet, and the proton is I=1/2. The product of their isospins is I=1 ⊗ I=1/2. The possible total isospins are I=3/2 and I=1/2. The Sigma^0 has I=1, so the decay can proceed only if the final state has a component with I=1. So we need to check if the combination of pion (I=1) and proton (I=1/2) can have a total isospin I=1.\n\nTo decompose I=1 ⊗ I=1/2: the possible total I are 3/2 and 1/2. So there's no I=1 component. Therefore, the decay Sigma^0 (I=1) -> pi^- (I=1) p (I=1/2) is forbidden by isospin conservation. But the problem says to find the ratio, implying that it is allowed. This is a contradiction. Therefore, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the Sigma^0 is part of a different isospin multiplet. Wait, the problem states that Sigma^0 has isospin I=1, I3=0. The decay to pi^- p would require the final state to have I=1, I3=0. Let's check.\n\nThe final state is pi^- (I=1, I3=-1) and p (I=1/2, I3=+1/2). The total I3 is -1 + 1/2 = -1/2. To get I=1, I3=0, the combination must have I3=0. But the total I3 here is -1/2, which doesn't match. Therefore, this decay is not allowed by isospin symmetry. However, the problem includes this decay in the list, so there must be an error in my analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Sigma^0 can decay via the I=1/2 component in the final state. But the initial state has I=1, so the amplitude must involve the overlap between the initial I=1 state and the final state's I=1/2 component. However, isospin is conserved in the strong interaction, so the decay must conserve isospin. Therefore, if the final state cannot have I=1, then the decay is forbidden. But the problem states that all decays are kinematically possible, so perhaps the Sigma^0 can decay via a different interaction, like electromagnetic? But the problem doesn't specify the interaction. However, the decays of baryons like Sigma^0 are typically via the strong interaction, which conserves isospin. Therefore, if the decay is allowed, it must conserve isospin. Therefore, the decay Sigma^0 -> pi^- p must have a final state with I=1, I3=0. But the total I3 of the final state is -1/2, which doesn't match. Therefore, this decay is forbidden. But the problem asks for the ratio, implying it is allowed. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the isospin assignments.\n\nWait, perhaps the pion is not I=1? No, pions are I=1. The proton is I=1/2. Let me double-check. The pion is indeed an I=1 triplet: pi^+ (I3=+1), pi^0 (I3=0), pi^- (I3=-1). The proton is part of the nucleon doublet with I=1/2. So the product of pion (I=1) and proton (I=1/2) gives possible total isospin I=3/2 or I=1/2. The Sigma^0 has I=1, so the decay can only proceed if the final state has an I=1 component. But since the possible total isospins are 3/2 and 1/2, there is no I=1 component. Therefore, the decay is forbidden by isospin. But the problem includes it, so I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the Sigma^0 is part of an I=1/2 multiplet? No, the problem states I=1. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Maybe the decay proceeds through a different initial isospin state? Or perhaps the decay is allowed due to some other consideration. Alternatively, maybe the decay Sigma^0 -> pi^- p is allowed through I=1/2 in the final state, but since the initial state is I=1, this would violate isospin conservation. Therefore, the amplitude should be zero. Hence, the decay rate would be zero, leading to a ratio of zero. But the problem asks for the ratio, so maybe it's not zero. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, but assuming it's correct, I need to find a way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Sigma^0 has a different isospin. Wait, the Sigma^0 is part of the Sigma triplet: Sigma^+ (I=1, I3=+1), Sigma^0 (I=1, I3=0), Sigma^- (I=1, I3=-1). So the isospin assignment is correct. Then, the decay to pi^- p must be forbidden. But the problem says to find the ratio, so perhaps there's a typo and the decay is Sigma^0 -> pi^+ pi^-, which would have total I=?\n\nWait, the fourth decay is Sigma^0 -> pi^+ pi^-. The pi^+ has I3=+1, pi^- has I3=-1. The total I3=0. The total isospin of two pions (each I=1) can be I=2, I=1, or I=0. The Sigma^0 has I=1, so the decay must go through the I=1 component of the two-pion system. The two pions in a state with I=1, I3=0. The amplitude would then depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining two I=1 pions into an I=1, I3=0 state.\n\nBut let's first handle the third decay: Sigma^0 -> pi^- p. If it's forbidden, then the ratio Gamma_{pi^- p} / Gamma_{K^- p} would be zero. However, the problem includes it, so perhaps there's an alternative approach. Maybe the Sigma^0 can decay into pi^- p through a different isospin channel. Wait, but the initial state is I=1, and the final state must have I=1. Since the final state's total isospin can only be 3/2 or 1/2, there's no I=1 component. Therefore, the amplitude is zero, and the decay rate is zero. Therefore, the ratio would be zero.\n\nSimilarly, for the decay Sigma^0 -> pi^+ pi^-. The two pions have total I=2, 1, or 0. The Sigma^0 has I=1, so the decay must go through the I=1 component of the two-pion system. The two pions are in a state with I=1, I3=0. The combination of pi^+ (I3=+1) and pi^- (I3=-1) can form an I=1, I3=0 state. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining two I=1 pions into an I=1, I3=0 state is needed.\n\nThe two-pion state is |1, +1> ⊗ |1, -1> (since pi^+ is I3=+1 and pi^- is I3=-1). To decompose this into total isospin states:\n\nThe product of two I=1 states can give I=2, 1, 0. The state |1, +1> ⊗ |1, -1> can be written as a combination of |2,0>, |1,0>, and |0,0>.\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for this combination can be found using the formula or tables. For two I=1 particles:\n\nThe state |I1=1, m1=+1> ⊗ |I2=1, m2=-1> decomposes as:\n\n|2,0> = sqrt(1/6) |+1, -1> + sqrt(2/3) |0,0> + sqrt(1/6) |-1, +1>\n\nWait, no. Actually, the general formula for combining |I1, m1> and |I2, m2> to get |I, M> is given by:\n\n|I, M> = sum_{m1 + m2 = M} <I1, m1; I2, m2 | I, M> |I1, m1> |I2, m2>\n\nBut to find the coefficient for a specific |I, M> in the product state, we need to use the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nFor our case, combining two I=1 states to get I=2,1,0:\n\nThe state |1, +1> ⊗ |1, -1> has M=0. The possible I values are 2,1,0.\n\nThe coefficients are:\n\n<2,0 | 1, +1; 1, -1> = sqrt( (1)(2 + 0 + 1)(2 - 0 + 1) / ( (2)(2 + 1)(2)(2 + 1) )) ) ? Wait, perhaps it's easier to recall specific coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for I1=I2=1:\n\nThe state |I=2, M=0> is given by:\n\n|2,0> = ( |+1, -1> + 2 |0,0> + |-1, +1> ) / sqrt(6)\n\nThe state |1,0> is:\n\n|1,0> = ( |+1, -1> - |-1, +1> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nThe state |0,0> is:\n\n|0,0> = ( |+1, -1> - |0,0> + |-1, +1> ) / sqrt(3)\n\nWait, I might be misremembering. Let me check a standard source or formula.\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two I=1 states can be found using the relation:\n\nFor I1=1, I2=1, the total I can be 2,1,0.\n\nThe state |I=2, M=0> is:\n\n|2,0> = (1/sqrt(6)) ( |+1, -1> + |0,0> + |-1, +1> )\n\nWait, no. Actually, the correct combination is:\n\n|2,0> = (1/sqrt(6)) ( |+1, -1> + 2 |0,0> + |-1, +1> )\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the ladder operators:\n\nStart with |2, +2> = |+1, +1>\n\nApply L- operator to get |2, +1> = (L- |+1, +1> ) / sqrt( (2)(2+1) - (+2)(+2-1) ) ) = ( |0, +1> + |+1, 0> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nContinue applying L- to get |2,0>:\n\nL- |2, +1> = sqrt( (2)(2+1) - (+1)(+1-1) ) |2,0> = sqrt(6-0) |2,0> = sqrt(6) |2,0>\n\nOn the other hand, L- acting on the product state:\n\nL- ( |+1, +1> ) = L- |+1> ⊗ |+1> + |+1> ⊗ L- |+1> = sqrt(2) |0> ⊗ |+1> + sqrt(2) |+1> ⊗ |0>\n\nTherefore, |2, +1> = ( |0, +1> + |+1, 0> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nApplying L- again:\n\nL- |2, +1> = ( L- |0, +1> + L- |+1, 0> ) / sqrt(2)\n\n= ( sqrt(2) |-1, +1> + sqrt(2) |0, 0> + sqrt(2) |+1, -1> + sqrt(2) |0, 0> )", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0}
{"id": "atomic/4-9", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about a collimated kaon beam with energy 2 GeV, and we need to find the distance at which the flux is reduced to 10% of its original value. The given lifetime is 1.2 × 10^-8 seconds. The options are in kilometers and meters, so the answer is probably in meters, but let's work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that particles like kaons decay over time, and their number decreases exponentially with time. The formula for the number of particles remaining after time t is N(t) = N0 * e^(-t/τ), where τ is the mean lifetime. Since we want the flux to be 10%, that means N(t)/N0 = 0.1. So, 0.1 = e^(-t/τ). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, ln(0.1) = -t/τ. Therefore, t = -τ * ln(0.1). Let me compute that. ln(0.1) is approximately -2.3026, so t = τ * 2.3026. Given τ is 1.2 × 10^-8 seconds, multiplying that by 2.3026 gives t ≈ 2.763 × 10^-8 seconds. That's the time it takes for the flux to reduce to 10%.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the distance, not the time. So we need to relate time to distance. Since the kaons are moving, distance is velocity multiplied by time. So distance L = v * t. But we need to find the velocity of the kaons. The energy given is 2 GeV. Kaons are mesons, so their rest mass is important here. Let me recall the mass of a kaon. The charged kaon (K±) has a rest mass of about 493.7 MeV/c². Let me confirm that. Yes, approximately 494 MeV/c². So if the energy is 2 GeV, which is 2000 MeV, that's much larger than the rest mass, so the kaons are relativistic.\n\nIn high-energy physics, when the energy is much larger than the rest mass, the velocity approaches the speed of light, but we need to calculate the exact gamma factor. The total energy E is gamma * m * c². So gamma = E / (m c²). Here, E is 2 GeV, m c² is 494 MeV. So gamma = 2000 / 494 ≈ 4.05. Then, the velocity v is beta * c, where beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Let's compute beta. 1/gamma² is 1/(4.05)^2 ≈ 1/16.4 ≈ 0.061. So 1 - 0.061 = 0.939. Therefore, beta ≈ sqrt(0.939) ≈ 0.969. So v ≈ 0.969c. The speed of light c is approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s. So v ≈ 0.969 * 3 × 10^8 ≈ 2.907 × 10^8 m/s.\n\nNow, the time t we found earlier is approximately 2.763 × 10^-8 seconds. So the distance L = v * t = 2.907 × 10^8 m/s * 2.763 × 10^-8 s. Let's multiply those numbers. 2.907 * 2.763 ≈ 8.03. Then, 10^8 * 10^-8 = 10^0 = 1. So L ≈ 8.03 meters. Hmm, that's close to option (c) 8.3 m. The slight difference might be due to more precise calculations. Let me check the steps again.\n\nFirst, calculating gamma: 2000 MeV / 494 MeV = 4.0486. Then beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). 1/gamma² = 1/(4.0486)^2 ≈ 1/16.391 ≈ 0.061. So 1 - 0.061 = 0.939. sqrt(0.939) ≈ 0.969, so beta is indeed approximately 0.969c. Then v = 0.969 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.907e8 m/s.\n\nTime t: τ * ln(10). Since ln(10) ≈ 2.3026, so t = 1.2e-8 s * 2.3026 ≈ 2.763e-8 s.\n\nDistance L: 2.907e8 m/s * 2.763e-8 s. Let's compute 2.907 * 2.763. Let's do 2.907 * 2 = 5.814, 2.907 * 0.7 = 2.0349, 2.907 * 0.063 ≈ 0.183. Adding those: 5.814 + 2.0349 = 7.8489 + 0.183 ≈ 8.0319. So approximately 8.03 meters. The options given are (c) 8.3 m. Hmm, close. Maybe the approximation in beta or gamma? Let's check with more precise gamma.\n\nGamma = 2000 / 494. Let's compute 2000 divided by 494. 494 * 4 = 1976. 2000 - 1976 = 24. So 24/494 ≈ 0.0486. So gamma ≈ 4.0486. Then 1/gamma² = 1/(4.0486)^2. Let's compute 4.0486 squared. 4^2 = 16, 0.0486^2 ≈ 0.00236, and cross term 2*4*0.0486 ≈ 0.3888. So total is 16 + 0.3888 + 0.00236 ≈ 16.391. So 1/gamma² ≈ 0.061 as before. So beta is sqrt(1 - 0.061) = sqrt(0.939). Let's compute sqrt(0.939) more accurately. Let's see, sqrt(0.939) is approximately 0.969. Let's check 0.969^2 = 0.938, which is 0.939 - 0.001. So maybe 0.96905^2 = (0.969 + 0.00005)^2 ≈ 0.969^2 + 2*0.969*0.00005 + (0.00005)^2 ≈ 0.938 + 0.0000969 + 0.0000000025 ≈ 0.9380969. Still a bit low. So actual beta is sqrt(0.939) ≈ 0.9695. Let's use that. Then v = 0.9695 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.9085e8 m/s.\n\nThen t = 1.2e-8 * ln(10). Let's use ln(10) ≈ 2.302585093. So t = 1.2e-8 * 2.302585093 ≈ 2.7631021e-8 seconds.\n\nThen L = v * t = 2.9085e8 m/s * 2.7631021e-8 s. Multiply 2.9085 * 2.7631021. Let's compute that:\n\n2.9085 * 2 = 5.817\n\n2.9085 * 0.7 = 2.03595\n\n2.9085 * 0.0631021 ≈ 2.9085 * 0.06 = 0.17451, 2.9085 * 0.0031021 ≈ ~0.00902\n\nAdding up: 5.817 + 2.03595 = 7.85295 + 0.17451 = 8.02746 + 0.00902 ≈ 8.03648.\n\nSo L ≈ 8.036 meters. The options have 8.3 m. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the rest mass of the kaon is different? Let me confirm. The K+ mass is approximately 493.677 MeV/c², and the K- is the same. So using 493.7 MeV is correct. Then gamma is 2000 / 493.7 ≈ 4.051. Let's compute gamma more precisely. 2000 divided by 493.7:\n\n493.7 * 4 = 1974.8\n\n2000 - 1974.8 = 25.2\n\n25.2 / 493.7 ≈ 0.05104\n\nSo gamma ≈ 4.05104.\n\nThen 1/gamma² = 1/(4.05104)^2. Let's compute 4.05104 squared:\n\n4.05^2 = 16.4025\n\nThen, 0.00104^2 ≈ 0.00000108\n\nCross term: 2*4.05*0.00104 ≈ 0.008424\n\nSo total is 16.4025 + 0.008424 + 0.00000108 ≈ 16.410925. So 1/gamma² ≈ 1/16.410925 ≈ 0.06093. So 1 - 0.06093 = 0.93907. Then sqrt(0.93907) ≈ 0.96905. So beta is approximately 0.96905c. Then velocity v = 0.96905 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.90715e8 m/s.\n\nTime t = 1.2e-8 s * ln(10) ≈ 1.2e-8 * 2.302585 ≈ 2.7631e-8 s.\n\nDistance L = v * t = 2.90715e8 m/s * 2.7631e-8 s ≈ (2.90715 * 2.7631) * 10^(8-8) = 2.90715*2.7631 ≈ Let's compute this more accurately.\n\n2.90715 * 2 = 5.8143\n\n2.90715 * 0.7 = 2.035005\n\n2.90715 * 0.0631 ≈ 0.1833 (since 2.90715 * 0.06 = 0.1744, 2.90715 * 0.0031 ≈ 0.00901)\n\nAdding up: 5.8143 + 2.035005 = 7.849305 + 0.1744 = 8.023705 + 0.00901 ≈ 8.032715.\n\nSo approximately 8.03 meters. The closest option is (c) 8.3 m. But wait, why is there a difference between 8.03 and 8.3? Maybe I missed a factor somewhere. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"collimated kaon beam\". Collimated means the particles are moving in a straight line, so we don't have to consider spreading due to angles. But perhaps the lifetime given is the proper lifetime, and we need to account for time dilation. Wait, but we did account for time dilation by using gamma. Because the lifetime τ given is the proper lifetime, so the lab frame lifetime is gamma*τ. Wait, no. Wait, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. Wait, but in the formula N(t) = N0 e^{-t/(gamma*tau)}, because the particles are moving, so their lifetime is dilated. Wait, no. Wait, the proper lifetime is tau, and the lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma*tau. Therefore, the decay time in the lab frame is longer. Wait, but in the problem, the kaons are moving, so from the lab frame, their lifetime is longer. Therefore, the time experienced by the kaon is t' = t / gamma, due to time dilation. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nThe proper lifetime is tau, which is the lifetime measured in the kaon's rest frame. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma*tau. Therefore, the number of particles remaining is N = N0 e^{-t/(gamma*tau)}. Wait, no. Wait, the decay follows N(t) = N0 e^{-t/tau'}, where tau' is the lifetime in the lab frame. Since tau' = gamma*tau. Therefore, N(t) = N0 e^{-t/(gamma tau)}. Wait, but this seems contradictory. Let me think again.\n\nIn the rest frame of the kaon, the lifetime is tau. So in that frame, the kaon decays after time tau. In the lab frame, the kaon is moving, so its lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So the lab frame lifetime is gamma*tau. Therefore, the time for the flux to reduce to 10% is t such that N(t) = N0 e^{-t/(gamma tau)} = 0.1 N0. Therefore, solving for t: e^{-t/(gamma tau)} = 0.1. Then, t = gamma tau ln(10). Wait, that's different from before. Wait, earlier I thought t = tau ln(10), but if the lifetime in the lab is gamma tau, then the decay rate is 1/(gamma tau), so the exponent is -t/(gamma tau). Therefore, solving 0.1 = e^{-t/(gamma tau)}, so ln(0.1) = -t/(gamma tau), so t = - gamma tau ln(0.1) = gamma tau ln(10). So t = gamma * tau * ln(10). Then, the distance L = v * t = v * gamma * tau * ln(10). But wait, v is beta c, and gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So let's see: v = beta c, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). Therefore, v * gamma = beta c / sqrt(1 - beta²). But beta = v/c, so sqrt(1 - beta²) = sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/gamma. Therefore, v * gamma = beta c * gamma. Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), beta * gamma = beta / sqrt(1 - beta²) = (v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Hmm, maybe there's a better way to express this. Alternatively, since gamma = E/(m c²), and E is the total energy. Let's see, E = gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). Then, v = beta c = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2) * c. Wait, but perhaps using beta gamma = (E/(m c²)) * beta. Alternatively, since beta gamma = (v/c) * gamma. Let's compute beta gamma. From gamma = 4.051, beta = 0.96905. So beta gamma = 0.96905 * 4.051 ≈ 3.925. Then, L = beta gamma c tau ln(10). Let's compute that.\n\nBeta gamma is approximately 3.925. c is 3e8 m/s. tau is 1.2e-8 s. ln(10) is 2.3026. So L = 3.925 * 3e8 m/s * 1.2e-8 s * 2.3026. Let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, 3.925 * 3e8 = 11.775e8.\n\nMultiply by 1.2e-8: 11.775e8 * 1.2e-8 = 11.775 * 1.2 = 14.13.\n\nThen multiply by 2.3026: 14.13 * 2.3026 ≈ 14.13 * 2 = 28.26, 14.13 * 0.3026 ≈ 4.275. Total ≈ 28.26 + 4.275 ≈ 32.535 meters. Wait, that's around 32.5 meters, which is close to option (b) 33 m. But this contradicts the previous calculation. What's going on here?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me rederive the correct formula. The number of particles remaining after time t in the lab frame is N(t) = N0 e^{-t/(gamma tau)}, because the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. Therefore, solving for t when N(t)/N0 = 0.1:\n\n0.1 = e^{-t/(gamma tau)} => ln(0.1) = -t/(gamma tau) => t = - gamma tau ln(0.1) = gamma tau ln(10).\n\nThen, the distance L is v t = beta c * gamma tau ln(10).\n\nBut beta gamma = (v/c) gamma = (beta) gamma. Since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), beta gamma = beta / sqrt(1 - beta²). Alternatively, beta gamma = sqrt(gamma² - 1). Because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), so gamma² = 1/(1 - beta²), so gamma² - 1 = beta²/(1 - beta²), so sqrt(gamma² -1 ) = beta / sqrt(1 - beta²) = beta gamma. Therefore, beta gamma = sqrt(gamma² -1). For gamma = 4.051, sqrt(4.051² -1) = sqrt(16.41 -1) = sqrt(15.41) ≈ 3.926. Which matches the previous beta gamma ≈ 3.925.\n\nTherefore, L = beta gamma c tau ln(10) ≈ 3.926 * 3e8 m/s * 1.2e-8 s * 2.3026.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\nFirst, 3.926 * 3e8 = 11.778e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 1.2e-8 s: 11.778e8 * 1.2e-8 = 11.778 * 1.2 * 10^(8-8) = 14.1336 * 10^0 = 14.1336 meters.\n\nThen multiply by ln(10) ≈ 2.3026: 14.1336 * 2.3026 ≈ 14.1336*2 = 28.2672, 14.1336*0.3026 ≈ 4.276. Total ≈ 28.2672 + 4.276 ≈ 32.5432 meters. So approximately 32.5 meters. Which is close to option (b) 33 m. But earlier calculation when I did v*t gave around 8 meters. So there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, this is a critical point. The confusion arises from whether we use the lab frame time or the proper time. Let me clarify.\n\nThe decay process depends on the proper time of the kaon. The number of particles left should be calculated using the proper time. However, in the lab frame, the time experienced by the kaon is dilated. So the relation between the lab frame time t and the proper time tau' is t = gamma tau'. Therefore, the proper time experienced by the kaon is tau' = t / gamma. The number of decays is determined by the proper time, so N = N0 e^{- tau' / tau} = N0 e^{- t/(gamma tau)}. Therefore, to have N/N0 = 0.1, we set e^{- t/(gamma tau)} = 0.1, leading to t = gamma tau ln(10). Then, the distance is L = v t = beta c gamma tau ln(10) = beta gamma c tau ln(10). Which is the same as before. So this gives L ≈ 32.5 meters, which is option (b) 33 m. But earlier when I calculated using v*t where t was tau ln(10), I got 8 meters. So which is correct?\n\nWait, the mistake earlier was not considering that the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau, so the time for the flux to reduce to 10% is gamma tau ln(10), not tau ln(10). Therefore, the correct calculation is L = v * gamma tau ln(10). Let's compute this again with precise numbers.\n\nGiven:\n\nE = 2 GeV = 2000 MeV\n\nm c² = 493.7 MeV\n\ngamma = 2000 / 493.7 ≈ 4.051\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/16.41) ≈ sqrt(0.939) ≈ 0.96905\n\nv = beta c ≈ 0.96905 * 3e8 ≈ 2.90715e8 m/s\n\ntau = 1.2e-8 s\n\nt = gamma * tau * ln(10) ≈ 4.051 * 1.2e-8 * 2.3026 ≈ 4.051 * 1.2e-8 ≈ 4.8612e-8 s, then multiplied by 2.3026 gives ≈ 1.1203e-7 s. Wait, no, wait: t = gamma * tau * ln(10). So gamma is 4.051, tau is 1.2e-8, ln(10) is 2.3026. So t = 4.051 * 1.2e-8 * 2.3026 ≈ 4.051 * 1.2e-8 ≈ 4.8612e-8, then 4.8612e-8 * 2.3026 ≈ 1.119e-7 seconds.\n\nThen L = v * t = 2.90715e8 m/s * 1.119e-7 s ≈ 2.90715 * 1.119 ≈ 3.25 * 1e1 (since 1e8 * 1e-7 = 1e1). So 3.25 * 1e1 meters = 32.5 meters. So approximately 33 meters, which is option (b). But earlier when I thought the time was tau*ln(10), I got 8 meters. So why the discrepancy?\n\nThe key is whether the decay time in the lab frame is gamma*tau (time dilated) or not. The correct approach is that the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma*tau, so the decay process is slower, hence the particles live longer, so they can travel further. Therefore, the correct formula uses t = gamma*tau*ln(10), leading to L = beta*c*gamma*tau*ln(10) = beta*gamma*c*tau*ln(10). Which gives around 32.5 meters. Therefore, the answer should be (b) 33 m.\n\nBut wait, the initial approach where I calculated t as tau*ln(10) and then multiplied by v gave 8 meters. That approach didn't account for time dilation. That was the mistake. The correct approach must account for the fact that in the lab frame, the kaons' lifetimes are longer by a factor of gamma. Therefore, the time available for decay is longer, so they can travel further before decaying. Therefore, the correct answer is option (b) 33 m.\n\nBut wait, let's check another way. The proper lifetime is tau. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma*tau. The distance traveled is v * gamma*tau*ln(10). Alternatively, using the relation between proper time and lab frame time. The flux decreases as N = N0 exp(-t/(gamma*tau)), where t is the lab frame time. To reach N/N0 = 0.1, t = gamma*tau*ln(10). Then L = v*t = beta*c*gamma*tau*ln(10). Which is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the rest frame of the kaon: the lab frame is moving at velocity v relative to the kaon. The distance in the lab frame is L = gamma*v*tau_rest*ln(10), but this might not be the right way. Hmm, perhaps not. Let's stick to the lab frame calculation.\n\nSo, with gamma ≈ 4.051, beta ≈ 0.969, c ≈ 3e8 m/s, tau = 1.2e-8 s, ln(10) ≈ 2.3026.\n\nL = beta * gamma * c * tau * ln(10)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nbeta*gamma = 0.969 * 4.051 ≈ 3.925\n\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\ntau = 1.2e-8 s\n\nln(10) ≈ 2.3026\n\nSo L = 3.925 * 3e8 * 1.2e-8 * 2.3026\n\nFirst, multiply 3.925 * 3e8 = 11.775e8\n\nThen multiply by 1.2e-8: 11.775e8 * 1.2e-8 = 11.775 * 1.2 = 14.13\n\nThen multiply by 2.3026: 14.13 * 2.3026 ≈ 32.54 meters.\n\nSo approximately 32.5 meters, which rounds to 33 meters, option (b). Therefore, the correct answer should be (b) 33 m.\n\nBut wait, the initial calculation where I used t = tau*ln(10) and then multiplied by v gave 8 meters. That was wrong because I forgot to multiply by gamma. The correct time is gamma*tau*ln(10), leading to a longer distance. Therefore, the answer is (b) 33 m.\n\nBut the options given are (a) 0.66 km, (b) 33 m, (c) 8.3 m. So according to this, the correct answer is (b). But I need to check if there's any other factor I missed.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the flux reduction is due to decay, which depends on the proper time experienced by the kaon. The proper time is related to the lab time by t' = t / gamma. So the number of decays is N = N0 e^{-t'/tau} = N0 e^{-t/(gamma tau)}. Therefore, solving for t when N/N0 = 0.1:\n\nt = gamma tau ln(10). Then L = v t = beta c gamma tau ln(10). Which is the same as before. So yes, the correct distance is about 33 meters.\n\nBut why did the initial approach give 8 meters? Because that approach used t = tau ln(10), which is the proper time, but in the lab frame, the time is longer by gamma. Therefore, the correct calculation must use the lab frame time, which is gamma times longer. Hence, the distance is gamma times larger. Therefore, the correct answer is (b) 33 m.\n\nBut let's verify with exact numbers. Let's compute beta*gamma*c*tau*ln(10):\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/E^2) = sqrt(1 - (493.7^2)/(2000^2)) = sqrt(1 - (243,741.69)/4,000,000) = sqrt(1 - 0.060935) = sqrt(0.939065) ≈ 0.96905.\n\ngamma = E/(m c²) = 2000/493.7 ≈ 4.051.\n\nbeta*gamma ≈ 0.96905 * 4.051 ≈ 3.925.\n\nc = 3e8 m/s.\n\ntau = 1.2e-8 s.\n\nln(10) ≈ 2.302585093.\n\nSo L = 3.925 * 3e8 * 1.2e-8 * 2.302585093.\n\nFirst, 3.925 * 3 = 11.775.\n\n11.775 * 1.2 = 14.13.\n\n14.13 * 2.302585093 ≈ 14.13 * 2 = 28.26, 14.13 * 0.302585 ≈ 4.276. Total ≈ 32.536 meters.\n\nSo approximately 32.5 meters, which is closest to option (b) 33 m. Therefore, the correct answer is (b).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the distance at which the kaon beam flux reduces to 10%, we use the relativistic decay formula.

{"id": "atomic/2-48", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so the question is about why two neutrons can't form a bound state even though the nuclear force is charge independent. Hmm. Let me start by recalling what charge independence means. I think it means that the nuclear force between two nucleons (protons or neutrons) is the same regardless of their charge. So, the force between a proton and a neutron, two protons, or two neutrons should be similar if other factors are the same. But wait, the question says that a neutron and a proton can form a bound state (like a deuteron), but two neutrons can't. So there's a contradiction here. If the nuclear force is charge independent, why the difference?\n\nWait, maybe charge independence isn't the only factor. Let me think. The nuclear force is a strong force mediated by mesons, right? And it's also short-ranged. But charge independence would imply that the force doesn't depend on the electric charge. However, protons have electric charge, so maybe the electromagnetic repulsion comes into play when you have two protons. But the question is about two neutrons. Neutrons are neutral, so there's no electromagnetic repulsion between them. So why can't they form a bound state?\n\nWait, the deuteron is a bound state of a proton and a neutron. If the nuclear force is charge independent, then two neutrons should also be able to form a similar bound state. But they don't. So maybe there's another factor here. Oh, right! The Pauli exclusion principle. Because neutrons are identical fermions, their wavefunction has to be antisymmetric. The deuteron has spin 1, which is symmetric under exchange. But for two neutrons, their spatial wavefunction and spin wavefunction combined must be antisymmetric. If they are in the same spatial state (like the deuteron's S-state), then their spin has to be antisymmetric. But the spin state for two neutrons can be either singlet (antisymmetric, spin 0) or triplet (symmetric, spin 1). Wait, but the deuteron is in a triplet state. So if two neutrons are in a triplet state, their spatial wavefunction would have to be symmetric. But if they are in the same spatial state (like S-wave), which is symmetric, then the spin would have to be antisymmetric. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the combinations. Let me clarify.\n\nFor two identical fermions, the total wavefunction (spatial × spin × isospin) must be antisymmetric. The deuteron is a proton and neutron, which are not identical particles, so their wavefunction doesn't have to be antisymmetric. But two neutrons are identical, so their wavefunction must be antisymmetric. Let's break it down. The spatial part: if they are in an S-wave (orbital angular momentum L=0), the spatial wavefunction is symmetric under exchange. Then the spin part must be antisymmetric. The spin singlet state (S=0) is antisymmetric. So two neutrons in S-wave with spin singlet would have an antisymmetric total wavefunction. But maybe the nuclear force is spin-dependent. The nuclear force is stronger in the triplet state (S=1) than the singlet state. Wait, the deuteron has spin 1 (triplet state), so the nuclear force is more attractive in the triplet state. If two neutrons are in the singlet state, the nuclear force might not be strong enough to bind them. But why can't they be in the triplet state? Because if they are in the triplet state (symmetric spin), then the spatial wavefunction would need to be antisymmetric. For L=0 (S-wave), the spatial wavefunction is symmetric, so that's not allowed. So to have a symmetric spin (triplet), the spatial part must be antisymmetric, which would require odd orbital angular momentum, like P-wave (L=1). But higher angular momentum states have higher energy and are less likely to form a bound state because the centrifugal barrier reduces the effective attraction. So even if the nuclear force is charge independent, the Pauli exclusion principle might prevent two neutrons from forming a bound state because the required spin and spatial configurations don't allow for a strong enough attraction. \n\nAdditionally, the isospin might play a role here. The nucleon-nucleon force is isospin dependent. The deuteron has isospin T=0, which is more strongly bound than T=1 states. Two neutrons would have isospin T=1 (since each neutron has T=1/2 and they combine to T=1 or T=0, but for two neutrons, the isospin must be symmetric, so T=1). The T=1 states might have weaker binding compared to T=0. So even though the nuclear force is charge independent (same for all isospin components), the specific combination of spin and isospin might lead to different binding energies. Therefore, the two-neutron system (dineutron) doesn't form a bound state because the combination of spin, isospin, and Pauli exclusion leads to insufficient binding energy. \n\nThis tells us that the nucleon-nucleon force is not only charge independent but also depends on spin and isospin. The strength of the force varies with the spin and isospin configuration of the nucleons. The deuteron exists because the proton and neutron can form a T=0 state with spin 1, which allows for a stronger attractive force. In contrast, two neutrons (or two protons) must be in a T=1 state, and the spin and spatial configurations required by the Pauli principle result in a weaker net attraction that's insufficient to overcome the repulsive core or other effects, preventing a bound state. Therefore, the nucleon-nucleon force is spin-dependent and isospin-dependent, even though it's charge independent in terms of the strong interaction.\n</think>\n\nThe nuclear force is charge independent, meaning it acts similarly between any two nucleons (protons or neutrons) regardless of their charge. However, the absence of a bound state for two neutrons (dineutron) arises due to quantum mechanical constraints and the spin-isospin dependence of the nucleon-nucleon force. Here's the key reasoning:\n\n1. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: Two neutrons are identical fermions, requiring their total wavefunction (spatial × spin × isospin) to be antisymmetric. For an S-wave (spatially symmetric), the spin state must be antisymmetric (singlet, \\(S=0\\)). However, the nuclear force is stronger in the triplet spin state (\\(S=1\\)), which is symmetric. To form a triplet state, the spatial wavefunction must be antisymmetric (e.g., P-wave), but higher angular momentum states (like P-wave) have a centrifugal barrier that reduces binding.\n\n2. **Isospin Dependence**: The deuteron (proton-neutron bound state) has isospin \\(T=0\\), which experiences stronger attraction. Two neutrons must form a symmetric isospin state (\\(T=1\\)), which is less strongly bound. The nuclear force is weaker in \\(T=1\\) configurations compared to \\(T=0\\).\n\n3. **Spin-Isospin Coupling**: The nucleon-nucleon force depends on both spin and isospin. Even though the force is charge independent, the specific combination of spin and isospin for two neutrons results in insufficient net attraction to form a bound state.\n\n**Conclusion**: The absence of a dineutron bound state reveals that the nucleon-nucleon force is not only charge independent but also **spin-dependent** and **isospin-dependent**. These dependencies, combined with the Pauli exclusion principle, determine whether a bound state can form.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The nucleon-nucleon force is spin-dependent and isospin-dependent.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{The nucleon-nucleon force is spin-dependent and isospin-dependent.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{The nucleon-nucleon force is spin-dependent and isospin-dependent.}", "expr2": "\\text{This shows the spin dependency of the nuclear force.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-50", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve part (a) of this problem where I have to calculate the potential considering the finite size of the nucleus. Let me start by recalling that the nucleus is a sphere of radius R with charge Z uniformly distributed. The electron is outside or inside this nucleus, so the potential will differ depending on the position relative to R.\n\nFirst, for a point nucleus, the potential is just the Coulomb potential, -Ze²/(4πε₀r). But since the nucleus has a finite size, the charge distribution is spread out. The charge density inside the nucleus should be uniform. So, the charge density ρ is (Ze) divided by the volume of the nucleus. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πR³, so ρ = 3Ze/(4πR³).\n\nNow, to find the electric field and then the potential, I need to use Gauss's law. For a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field E(r) at radius r will depend on whether r is inside or outside the nucleus.\n\nFor r ≥ R (outside the nucleus), all the charge is enclosed, so Gauss's law gives E(r) * 4πr² = Ze/ε₀. Therefore, E(r) = Ze/(4πε₀r²), which is the same as the point charge case. So the potential here would be the same as Coulomb potential, right? But wait, the potential is found by integrating the electric field from infinity to r. But since outside the nucleus, the field is the same as point charge, the potential for r ≥ R is -Ze²/(4πε₀r) * (1/4πε₀) ? Wait, maybe I need to be careful with units. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the potential V(r) is the integral of the electric field from infinity to r. For r ≥ R, the electric field is Ze/(4πε₀r²), so integrating from infinity to r gives V(r) = [Ze/(4πε₀)] * (1/r) + constant. But the potential at infinity is zero, so V(r) = Ze/(4πε₀r) for r ≥ R. But since the electron has charge -e, the potential energy would be -e * V(r) = -Ze²/(4πε₀r), same as the point nucleus. So outside the nucleus, the potential is the same as point charge.\n\nBut inside the nucleus, r < R, the enclosed charge is not Ze. The charge enclosed Q_enc is ρ*(4/3)πr³. Since ρ = 3Ze/(4πR³), then Q_enc = [3Ze/(4πR³)] * (4/3)πr³) = Ze(r³/R³). So Gauss's law gives E(r) * 4πr² = Q_enc/ε₀ = Ze r³/(ε₀ R³). Therefore, E(r) = Ze r/(4πε₀ R³). \n\nThen, the electric field inside the nucleus is proportional to r. To find the potential inside the nucleus, we need to integrate the electric field from infinity to R, and then from R to r. Wait, but the potential is continuous at r = R. Let me compute V(r) for r < R.\n\nFirst, the potential at R is V(R) = Ze/(4πε₀ R). Then, for r < R, the electric field is E(r) = Ze r/(4πε₀ R³). The potential difference between R and r is the integral from r to R of E(r') dr'. So:\n\nV(r) = V(R) - ∫ (from r to R) E(r') dr'\n\nCompute the integral:\n\n∫ (Ze r')/(4πε₀ R³) dr' from r to R = (Ze)/(4πε₀ R³) ∫ r' dr' from r to R = (Ze)/(4πε₀ R³) [ (R²/2 - r²/2) ]\n\nSo:\n\nV(r) = (Ze)/(4πε₀ R) - (Ze)/(8πε₀ R³) (R² - r²) = (Ze)/(4πε₀ R) - (Ze)/(8πε₀ R³)(R² - r²)\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst term: Ze/(4πε₀ R)\n\nSecond term: - Ze/(8πε₀ R³)(R² - r²) = - Ze/(8πε₀ R) + Ze r²/(8πε₀ R³)\n\nCombine terms:\n\nZe/(4πε₀ R) - Ze/(8πε₀ R) + Ze r²/(8πε₀ R³) = (Ze/(8πε₀ R)) + (Ze r²)/(8πε₀ R³)\n\nFactor out Ze/(8πε₀ R³):\n\n= (Ze)/(8πε₀ R³) [ R² + r² ]\n\nWait, let me check the algebra again.\n\nWait:\n\nFirst term: Ze/(4πε₀ R) = 2Ze/(8πε₀ R)\n\nSecond term: - Ze/(8πε₀ R) + Ze r²/(8πε₀ R³)\n\nSo combining:\n\n2Ze/(8πε₀ R) - Ze/(8πε₀ R) = Ze/(8πε₀ R)\n\nThen add the last term: + Ze r²/(8πε₀ R³)\n\nSo overall:\n\nV(r) = Ze/(8πε₀ R³) ( R² + r² )\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, let's re-express:\n\nV(r) = [Ze/(4πε₀ R)] - [Ze/(8πε₀ R³)(R² - r²)]\n\n= [2Ze/(8πε₀ R)] - [Ze R²/(8πε₀ R³) - Ze r²/(8πε₀ R³)]\n\n= [2Ze/(8πε₀ R)] - [Ze/(8πε₀ R) - Ze r²/(8πε₀ R³)]\n\n= 2Ze/(8πε₀ R) - Ze/(8πε₀ R) + Ze r²/(8πε₀ R³)\n\n= Ze/(8πε₀ R) + Ze r²/(8πε₀ R³)\n\nFactor out Ze/(8πε₀ R³):\n\n= Ze/(8πε₀ R³) [ R² + r² ]\n\nBut R² + r²? Hmm. Alternatively, factor as:\n\n= (Ze)/(8πε₀ R³) (R² + r²) = (Ze)/(8πε₀ R³)(R² + r²)\n\nBut perhaps another way to write this is:\n\nV(r) = (Ze)/(8πε₀ R) [3 - (r²/R²)]\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nSuppose we have:\n\nZe/(8πε₀ R³)(R² + r²) = Ze/(8πε₀ R³)(R² + r²) = Ze/(8πε₀ R) (1 + (r²/R²)/1 )\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me compute:\n\nWait, if I take R² + r² over R³, that's (R² + r²)/R³ = (1/R) + (r²)/R³. Hmm, not sure. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration. Let me recheck the integral.\n\nThe integral from r to R of E(r') dr' is ∫ [Ze r'/(4πε₀ R³)] dr' from r to R.\n\nSo that's [Ze/(4πε₀ R³)] ∫ r' dr' from r to R.\n\nIntegral of r' dr' is (r'^2)/2 evaluated from r to R: (R²/2 - r²/2).\n\nSo the integral is [Ze/(4πε₀ R³)] * (R² - r²)/2 = [Ze (R² - r²)]/(8πε₀ R³)\n\nTherefore, V(r) = V(R) - [Ze (R² - r²)]/(8πε₀ R³)\n\nBut V(R) is Ze/(4πε₀ R)\n\nSo:\n\nV(r) = (Ze)/(4πε₀ R) - [Ze (R² - r²)]/(8πε₀ R³)\n\nLet me factor out Ze/(8πε₀ R³):\n\n= [Ze/(8πε₀ R³)] [ 2 R² - (R² - r²) ]\n\n= [Ze/(8πε₀ R³)] [ 2 R² - R² + r² ]\n\n= [Ze/(8πε₀ R³)] [ R² + r² ]\n\nSo V(r) = Ze (R² + r²)/(8πε₀ R³)\n\nBut that's the expression for the potential inside the nucleus (r ≤ R). So the potential inside is quadratic in r. For r ≥ R, it's the usual Coulomb potential.\n\nTherefore, the total potential is:\n\nV(r) = {\n    (Ze)/(4πε₀) * ( (3 R² - r²)/(2 R³) ) , for r ≤ R\n    (Ze)/(4πε₀ r) , for r ≥ R\n}\n\nWait, let me check. If I write (R² + r²)/(8πε₀ R³) * Ze, but 8 is 2*4, so:\n\nZe/(8πε₀ R³) (R² + r²) = Ze/(4πε₀) * (R² + r²)/(2 R³) = Ze/(4πε₀) * (1/(2 R) + r²/(2 R³))\n\nAlternatively, maybe another way to write it. Let me see:\n\nWait, (R² + r²)/(2 R³) = (1/(2 R)) + (r²)/(2 R³). Hmm, but perhaps the standard form is (3 R² - r²)/(2 R³). Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, if I have (3 R² - r²)/(2 R³) = 3/(2 R) - r²/(2 R³). But that's different from what I have. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nWait, let's go back. The expression inside the nucleus was:\n\nV(r) = Ze/(4πε₀ R) - [Ze (R² - r²)]/(8πε₀ R³)\n\nLet me combine these terms:\n\nFirst term: Ze/(4πε₀ R) = 2 Ze/(8πε₀ R)\n\nSecond term: - Ze (R² - r²)/(8πε₀ R³) = - Ze R²/(8πε₀ R³) + Ze r²/(8πε₀ R³) = - Ze/(8πε₀ R) + Ze r²/(8πε₀ R³)\n\nSo combining the two terms:\n\n2 Ze/(8πε₀ R) - Ze/(8πε₀ R) + Ze r²/(8πε₀ R³) = Ze/(8πε₀ R) + Ze r²/(8πε₀ R³)\n\nFactor out Ze/(8πε₀ R³):\n\n= Ze/(8πε₀ R³) ( R² + r² )\n\nBut R² + r² is not the same as 3 R² - r². Wait, maybe I messed up the sign. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the potential inside is V(r) = V(R) minus the integral from r to R of E(r') dr'. Since E(r') is directed outward, the potential decreases as we move from R to r. Wait, but the integral from r to R of E dr' would be positive if E is positive (since dr' is from r to R). So V(r) = V(R) - ∫ E dr'\n\nBut E is the electric field magnitude. Since electric field points outward, and we're moving inward from R to r, the potential increases. Wait, maybe the integral is negative? Let me think.\n\nThe potential difference between R and r (r < R) is ΔV = V(r) - V(R) = - ∫ (from R to r) E · dl. Since dl is dr in the radial direction, and E is outward (positive), then:\n\nΔV = - ∫ (R to r) E dr' = ∫ (r to R) E dr'\n\nSo V(r) = V(R) + ∫ (r to R) E dr'\n\nWait, no. Wait, the potential at r is equal to the potential at R plus the integral of E from r to R. Because moving from r to R, against the electric field, so the potential increases. So V(r) = V(R) + ∫ (r to R) E dr'\n\nBut in our case, E inside is Ze r/(4πε₀ R³). So:\n\n∫ (r to R) E dr' = ∫ (r to R) [Ze r']/(4πε₀ R³) dr' = [Ze/(4πε₀ R³)] * [ (R²/2 - r²/2) ]\n\nSo V(r) = V(R) + [Ze/(8πε₀ R³)] (R² - r²)\n\nBut V(R) is Ze/(4πε₀ R), so:\n\nV(r) = Ze/(4πε₀ R) + [Ze (R² - r²)]/(8πε₀ R³)\n\n= [2 Ze R² + Ze (R² - r²)]/(8πε₀ R³)\n\n= [2 R² + R² - r²] Ze/(8πε₀ R³)\n\n= [3 R² - r²] Ze/(8πε₀ R³)\n\nAh! There we go. So that's the correct expression. So inside the nucleus, the potential is V(r) = Ze (3 R² - r²)/(8πε₀ R³)\n\nSo that's the correct form. Therefore, the potential is:\n\nFor r ≤ R:\n\nV(r) = (Ze)/(8πε₀ R³) (3 R² - r²) = (Ze)/(4πε₀) * (3 R² - r²)/(2 R³) = (Ze)/(4πε₀) * (3/(2 R) - r²/(2 R³))\n\nAnd for r ≥ R:\n\nV(r) = (Ze)/(4πε₀ r)\n\nSo that's part (a). So the potential considering finite size is given by these expressions. Therefore, the answer to part (a) is expressing V(r) as above.\n\nMoving to part (b), we need to calculate the level shift for the 1s state of ^208Pb using perturbation theory. The assumption is that R is much smaller than the Bohr radius, so the perturbation is small. The shift is given by the expectation value of the perturbing potential.\n\nFirst, the unperturbed potential is the Coulomb potential due to a point nucleus, and the perturbation ΔV is the difference between the finite-size potential and the point nucleus potential.\n\nSo ΔV(r) = V_finite(r) - V_point(r)\n\nFor r ≥ R, V_finite(r) = V_point(r) = -Ze²/(4πε₀ r), so ΔV(r) = 0 in that region.\n\nFor r ≤ R, V_finite(r) = (Ze)/(4πε₀) * (3 R² - r²)/(2 R³) and V_point(r) = -Ze²/(4πε₀ r). Wait, wait, no. Wait, the potential energy for the electron is -e times the electric potential due to the nucleus. So actually, the potential energy V(r) is -e φ(r), where φ(r) is the electric potential.\n\nWait, I need to be careful here. The potential energy of the electron in the electric field of the nucleus is U(r) = -e φ(r), where φ(r) is the electric potential due to the nucleus.\n\nSo for the point nucleus, φ_point(r) = Ze/(4πε₀ r), so U_point(r) = -e * Ze/(4πε₀ r) = -Z e²/(4πε₀ r)\n\nFor the finite nucleus, inside r ≤ R, φ_finite(r) = Ze (3 R² - r²)/(8πε₀ R³), so U_finite(r) = -e * φ_finite(r) = - Z e² (3 R² - r²)/(8πε₀ R³)\n\nTherefore, the perturbation ΔU(r) = U_finite(r) - U_point(r)\n\nBut wait, for r ≤ R, U_point(r) = - Z e²/(4πε₀ r), and U_finite(r) = - Z e² (3 R² - r²)/(8πε₀ R³)\n\nSo ΔU(r) = U_finite - U_point = [ - Z e² (3 R² - r²)/(8πε₀ R³) ] - [ - Z e²/(4πε₀ r) ]\n\n= - Z e²/(8πε₀ R³) (3 R² - r²) + Z e²/(4πε₀ r)\n\nBut this is only for r ≤ R. For r > R, ΔU(r) = 0.\n\nBut since R is much smaller than the Bohr radius a₀, the wavefunction of the 1s state is approximately constant over the region r ≤ R. The Bohr radius a₀ is (4πε₀ ħ²)/(m e²), and for a hydrogen-like atom with charge Z, the Bohr radius is a₀/Z. But since R ≪ a₀/Z, the wavefunction varies as e^{-Zr/a₀}, so at r ≈ R, the exponent is ~ Z R /a₀ ≪ 1, so we can approximate the wavefunction as being constant, ψ ≈ ψ(0).\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of ΔU is approximately ψ(0)² times the integral over r ≤ R of ΔU(r) d³r.\n\nSo the level shift ΔE ≈ ⟨ψ|ΔU|ψ⟩ ≈ |ψ(0)|² ∫_{r=0}^R ΔU(r) d³r\n\nFirst, compute |ψ(0)|² for the 1s state. The 1s wavefunction for hydrogen-like atom is ψ_1s(r) = (Z³/(π a₀³))^{1/2} e^{-Zr/a₀}\n\nAt r=0, ψ(0) = (Z³/(π a₀³))^{1/2}\n\nSo |ψ(0)|² = Z³/(π a₀³)\n\nNow, compute the integral ∫ ΔU(r) d³r from 0 to R.\n\nΔU(r) = [ - Z e²/(8πε₀ R³) (3 R² - r²) + Z e²/(4πε₀ r) ] for r ≤ R\n\nBut this seems complicated. Wait, but perhaps there's a better way. Let's recall that the perturbation is the difference between the finite nucleus potential and the point nucleus potential. So for r ≤ R, the finite nucleus potential is different, and for r > R, it's the same. Therefore, the perturbation ΔU(r) is non-zero only for r ≤ R, and there it's equal to U_finite(r) - U_point(r).\n\nBut U_finite(r) is the potential due to the extended nucleus, and U_point(r) is the potential due to a point charge. So ΔU(r) is the correction needed to account for the finite size.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value of ΔU as the integral from 0 to R of [U_finite(r) - U_point(r)] |ψ(r)|² 4π r² dr\n\nBut since R is much smaller than a₀/Z, we can approximate |ψ(r)|² ≈ |ψ(0)|² for r ≤ R. Therefore, the integral becomes |ψ(0)|² ∫ [U_finite(r) - U_point(r)] 4π r² dr from 0 to R\n\nSo let's compute this integral.\n\nFirst, compute U_finite(r) - U_point(r) for r ≤ R:\n\nΔU(r) = [ - Z e² (3 R² - r²)/(8πε₀ R³) ] - [ - Z e²/(4πε₀ r) ]\n\n= - Z e²/(8πε₀ R³) (3 R² - r²) + Z e²/(4πε₀ r)\n\n= Z e²/(4πε₀) [ - (3 R² - r²)/(2 R³) + 1/r ]\n\nBut this seems messy. Let's compute the integral term by term.\n\nFirst term: ∫ [ - Z e² (3 R² - r²)/(8πε₀ R³) ] 4π r² dr from 0 to R\n\nSecond term: ∫ [ Z e²/(4πε₀ r) ] 4π r² dr from 0 to R\n\nCompute first term:\n\n- Z e²/(8πε₀ R³) * 4π ∫ (3 R² - r²) r² dr from 0 to R\n\n= - Z e²/(8πε₀ R³) * 4π [ 3 R² ∫ r² dr - ∫ r^4 dr ] from 0 to R\n\nCompute integrals:\n\n∫ r² dr from 0 to R = R³/3\n\n∫ r^4 dr from 0 to R = R^5/5\n\nSo:\n\n= - Z e²/(8πε₀ R³) * 4π [ 3 R²*(R³/3) - R^5/5 ]\n\n= - Z e²/(8πε₀ R³) * 4π [ R^5 - R^5/5 ]\n\n= - Z e²/(8πε₀ R³) * 4π * (4 R^5/5 )\n\n= - Z e²/(8πε₀ R³) * 4π * 4 R^5 /5\n\n= - Z e²/(8πε₀) * 16 π R² /5\n\n= - Z e²/(8πε₀) * (16 π R²)/5\n\n= - (Z e² 16 π R²)/(40 π ε₀ )\n\nSimplify:\n\n16/40 = 4/10 = 2/5\n\nSo:\n\n= - (Z e² 2 R²)/(5 ε₀ )\n\nNow compute the second term:\n\n∫ [ Z e²/(4πε₀ r) ] 4π r² dr from 0 to R\n\n= Z e²/(4πε₀) * 4π ∫ r dr from 0 to R\n\n= Z e²/(4πε₀) * 4π * (R²/2 )\n\n= Z e²/(4πε₀) * 4π R²/2\n\n= Z e²/(4πε₀) * 2π R²\n\n= Z e² R²/(2 ε₀ )\n\nSo combining the two terms:\n\nΔU_integral = - (2 Z e² R²)/(5 ε₀ ) + (Z e² R²)/(2 ε₀ )\n\n= Z e² R²/ε₀ ( -2/5 + 1/2 )\n\n= Z e² R²/ε₀ ( (-4/10 + 5/10) )\n\n= Z e² R²/ε₀ (1/10)\n\n= Z e² R²/(10 ε₀ )\n\nTherefore, the integral ∫ ΔU(r) d³r ≈ 4π ∫ ΔU(r) r² dr from 0 to R is equal to Z e² R²/(10 ε₀ )\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, the integral we computed was ∫ [U_finite - U_point] 4π r² dr, which is equal to Z e² R²/(10 ε₀ )\n\nThen, the expectation value ⟨ΔU⟩ ≈ |ψ(0)|² * ΔU_integral\n\nWe have |ψ(0)|² = Z³/(π a₀³)\n\nSo:\n\nΔE ≈ (Z³/(π a₀³)) * (Z e² R²)/(10 ε₀ )\n\n= Z^4 e² R²/(10 π ε₀ a₀³ )\n\nBut let's express this in terms of known constants. Recall that the Bohr radius a₀ = (4π ε₀ ħ²)/(m e²)\n\nSo a₀³ = (4π ε₀ ħ²/(m e²))³\n\nLet me substitute a₀³ into the expression:\n\nΔE = Z^4 e² R²/(10 π ε₀ ) * 1/( (4π ε₀ ħ²/(m e²))³ )\n\n= Z^4 e² R²/(10 π ε₀ ) * (m e²)^3/( (4π ε₀)^3 ħ^6 )\n\n= Z^4 e² R² (m^3 e^6) / (10 π ε₀ (4π ε₀)^3 ħ^6 )\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n(4π ε₀)^3 = 64 π³ ε₀^3\n\nSo denominator: 10 π ε₀ * 64 π³ ε₀^3 = 10 * 64 π^4 ε₀^4 = 640 π^4 ε₀^4\n\nNumerator: Z^4 e² R² m^3 e^6 = Z^4 m^3 e^8 R²\n\nSo ΔE = Z^4 m^3 e^8 R² / (640 π^4 ε₀^4 ħ^6 )\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to express this in terms of the ground state energy.\n\nRecall that the ground state energy of hydrogen-like atom is E_n = - (Z² e⁴ m)/(2 (4π ε₀)^2 ħ²) * 1/n²\n\nFor n=1, E_1s = - Z² e⁴ m/(2 (4π ε₀)^2 ħ² )\n\nBut our shift is ΔE = something positive? Wait, the finite size makes the potential less singular at the origin, so the electron can lower its energy? Wait, the point nucleus has a potential that goes to -infinity as r approaches 0, but the finite nucleus has a finite potential at r=0. So the perturbation ΔU is positive (since U_finite is less negative than U_point in the region r ≤ R). Therefore, the energy shift ΔE should be positive, meaning the energy is less negative, i.e., the level is shifted upward.\n\nBut let's see. The expectation value of ΔU is positive, so the energy increases.\n\nBut let's see if we can express ΔE in terms of E_1s or other known terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express ΔE in terms of the expectation value of r² or something.\n\nAlternatively, note that the leading term in the perturbation comes from the difference in potential inside the nucleus. Since the wavefunction is approximately constant there, the shift is proportional to the integral of ΔU(r) over the nucleus volume.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard formula for this. The level shift due to finite nuclear size is given by ΔE ≈ (2/5) (Zα)^4 (m c^2) (R/a₀)^2, where α is the fine-structure constant. But I need to derive it.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to simplify the expression we have.\n\nWe have ΔE = Z^4 e² R²/(10 π ε₀ a₀³ ) * |ψ(0)|² factor? Wait, no. Wait, earlier steps:\n\nWait, the integral ∫ ΔU(r) d³r = Z e² R²/(10 ε₀ )\n\nThen, the expectation value is |ψ(0)|² * ∫ ΔU(r) d³r = (Z³/(π a₀³)) * (Z e² R²)/(10 ε₀ )\n\nSo ΔE = Z^4 e² R²/(10 π ε₀ a₀³ )\n\nNow, substitute a₀ = (4π ε₀ ħ²)/(m e²)\n\nSo a₀³ = (4π ε₀ ħ²/(m e²))³\n\nTherefore:\n\nΔE = Z^4 e² R²/(10 π ε₀ ) * (m e²)^3/( (4π ε₀)^3 ħ^6 )\n\n= Z^4 e² R² m^3 e^6 / (10 π ε₀ (4π ε₀)^3 ħ^6 )\n\n= Z^4 m^3 e^8 R² / (10 π ε₀ (64 π^3 ε₀^3) ħ^6 )\n\n= Z^4 m^3 e^8 R² / (640 π^4 ε₀^4 ħ^6 )\n\nThis is quite a complicated expression. Let's see if we can relate this to the Rydberg constant or other known terms.\n\nThe Rydberg constant R_H = (m e^4)/(8 ε₀² h³ c) ), but perhaps using ħ = h/(2π), so h = 2π ħ.\n\nAlternatively, express in terms of the Bohr energy E_1s = - (Z² e⁴ m)/(2 (4π ε₀)^2 ħ² )\n\nLet me compute E_1s:\n\nE_1s = - Z² e⁴ m / (2 (4π ε₀)^2 ħ² )\n\nLet me compute the ratio ΔE / |E_1s|:\n\nΔE / |E_1s| = [ Z^4 m^3 e^8 R² / (640 π^4 ε₀^4 ħ^6 ) ] / [ Z² e⁴ m / (2 (4π ε₀)^2 ħ² ) ]\n\n= [ Z^4 m^3 e^8 R² / 640 π^4 ε₀^4 ħ^6 ] * [ 2 (4π ε₀)^2 ħ² / (Z² e⁴ m) ]\n\n= [ Z^2 m^2 e^4 R² / 640 π^4 ε₀^4 ħ^6 ] * [ 2 (16 π² ε₀^2) ħ² / 1 ]\n\n= Z^2 m^2 e^4 R² * 32 π² ε₀^2 ħ² / (640 π^4 ε₀^4 ħ^6 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n32 / 640 = 1/20\n\nπ² / π^4 = 1/π²\n\nε₀^2 / ε₀^4 = 1/ε₀²\n\nħ² / ħ^6 = 1/ħ^4\n\nSo:\n\nΔE / |E_1s| = Z^2 m^2 e^4 R² / (20 π² ε₀² ħ^4 )\n\nBut this still seems complicated. Let's see if we can express this in terms of the fine-structure constant α = e²/(4π ε₀ ħ c) ≈ 1/137\n\nSo α = e²/(4π ε₀ ħ c) → e²/(4π ε₀) = α ħ c\n\nTherefore, e^4/(4π ε₀)^2 = α² ħ² c²\n\nLet me substitute e^4 = (4π ε₀ α ħ c)^2\n\nWait, maybe substitute e²/(4π ε₀) = α ħ c into the expression for ΔE.\n\nΔE = Z^4 e² R²/(10 π ε₀ a₀³ )\n\nExpress e²/(4π ε₀) as α ħ c:\n\nΔE = Z^4 * (4π ε₀ α ħ c) * R²/(10 π ε₀ a₀³ )\n\nSimplify:\n\n4π ε₀ / (10 π ε₀) = 4/10 = 2/5\n\nSo:\n\nΔE = Z^4 * 2/5 * α ħ c R² / a₀³\n\nBut a₀ = (4π ε₀ ħ²)/(m e²) = (ħ/(m c α)) ) * (4π ε₀ ħ²)/(m e²) ??? Wait, let's express a₀ in terms of α:\n\na₀ = (4π ε₀ ħ²)/(m e²) = (4π ε₀ ħ²)/(m (4π ε₀ α ħ c)) ) = ħ/(m c α )\n\nYes, because e²/(4π ε₀) = α ħ c, so e² = 4π ε₀ α ħ c\n\nTherefore, a₀ = (4π ε₀ ħ²)/(m * 4π ε₀ α ħ c ) ) = ħ/(m c α )\n\nSo a₀ = ħ/(m c α )\n\nTherefore, a₀³ = ħ³/(m³ c³ α³ )\n\nSubstitute into ΔE:\n\nΔE = Z^4 * (2/5) α ħ c R² / ( ħ³/(m³ c³ α³ ) )\n\n= Z^4 * (2/5) α ħ c R² * m³ c³ α³ / ħ³\n\n= Z^4 * (2/5) m³ c^4 α^4 R² / ħ²\n\nBut ħ = h/(2π), so ħ² = h²/(4π²)\n\nBut maybe better to express in terms of mc² and α.\n\nAlternatively, note that m c² is the rest energy of the electron, approximately 511 keV.\n\nBut perhaps we can write ΔE as:\n\nΔE = (2/5) Z^4 α^4 (R/a₀)^2 m c²\n\nBecause:\n\nFrom above, ΔE = Z^4 * (2/5) α^4 m c² (R² m² c² α² )/( ħ² )\n\nWait, maybe not.

Hmm, this might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, using a₀ = ħ/(m c α ), so m c / ħ = 1/(a₀ α )\n\nTherefore, m³ c³ / ħ³ = 1/(a₀³ α³ )\n\nSo:\n\nΔE = Z^4 * (2/5) α^4 * (m³ c^4 / ħ² ) R²\n\nBut m c² is energy, so m c^4 / ħ² has units of energy over length squared. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's express in terms of the Rydberg constant R_H = m e^4/(8 ε₀² h³ c) = m c α²/(2 h)\n\nBut perhaps it's better to proceed numerically for part (c), but part (b) asks for an expression.\n\nAlternatively, the standard result for the finite size correction is ΔE ≈ (4/5) (Zα)^2 (R/a₀)^2 |E_1s|\n\nBut I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, let's recall that the expectation value of r² for the 1s state is ⟨r²⟩ = 3 a₀²/Z²\n\nBut in our case, the perturbation is ΔU(r) which is non-zero only inside r ≤ R. But since R ≪ a₀/Z, the wavefunction is roughly constant, so the integral is proportional to R².\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way. Let's go back to the expression we had:\n\nΔE ≈ |ψ(0)|² * (Z e² R²)/(10 ε₀ )\n\nGiven that |ψ(0)|² = Z³/(π a₀³ )\n\nSo:\n\nΔE = (Z³/(π a₀³ )) * (Z e² R²)/(10 ε₀ )\n\n= Z^4 e² R²/(10 π ε₀ a₀³ )\n\nNow, using a₀ = 4π ε₀ ħ²/(m e² )\n\nSo a₀³ = (4π ε₀)^3 ħ^6/(m³ e^6 )\n\nSubstitute:\n\nΔE = Z^4 e² R²/(10 π ε₀ ) * m³ e^6/( (4π ε₀)^3 ħ^6 )\n\n= Z^4 m³ e^8 R²/(10 π ε₀ (4π ε₀)^3 ħ^6 )\n\n= Z^4 m³ e^8 R²/(10 π (4π)^3 ε₀^4 ħ^6 )\n\n= Z^4 m³ e^8 R²/(10 * 64 π^4 ε₀^4 ħ^6 )\n\n= Z^4 m³ e^8 R²/(640 π^4 ε₀^4 ħ^6 )\n\nThis is the same as before.

{"id": "atomic/2-41", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the number of fissions per second in a 100-MW reactor. The options are 10^6, 10^12, 10^18, 10^24, 10^30. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct. \n\nFirst, I remember that power is energy per time. So a reactor with 100 MW of power is producing 100 million joules per second. Since 1 watt is 1 joule per second, 100 MW is 100 x 10^6 watts, which is 10^8 joules per second. So each second, the reactor releases 10^8 J of energy.\n\nNow, each fission reaction releases a certain amount of energy. I think the energy per fission is around 200 MeV, but I need to confirm that. Let me recall. Yeah, typical energy per fission of uranium-235 is about 200 MeV. So each fission event gives about 200 MeV of energy. \n\nBut I need to convert that into joules to relate it to the power output. Since 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So 200 MeV would be 200 x 10^6 eV, right? So that's 2e8 eV. Multiply by 1.602e-19 J/eV to get the energy per fission in joules. Let me calculate that. \n\n200 MeV = 200 * 1.602e-13 J (since 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, and 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 1 MeV is 1.602e-13 J). So 200 MeV is 200 * 1.602e-13 = 3.204e-11 J per fission. \n\nSo each fission gives about 3.2e-11 joules. \n\nNow, the reactor produces 1e8 J per second. To find the number of fissions per second, I need to divide the total energy per second by the energy per fission. \n\nSo number of fissions per second = (1e8 J/s) / (3.2e-11 J/fission) = (1e8) / (3.2e-11) = (1 / 3.2) * 1e19 ≈ 0.3125 * 1e19 = 3.125e18 fissions per second. \n\nLooking at the options, 10^18 is one of them. The calculation gives approximately 3e18, which is closest to 10^18. Wait, but 3e18 is 3 times 10^18. Hmm, but maybe the options are approximate orders of magnitude. So 3e18 is 10^18.5, but the closest given option is 10^18. Maybe the actual energy per fission is a bit different. Let me check again. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo the steps. \n\nFirst, 200 MeV per fission. Converting that to joules:\n\n200 MeV = 200 * 1e6 eV = 2e8 eV. \n\n1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 2e8 eV = 2e8 * 1.602e-19 J = 3.204e-11 J. That's correct. \n\nThen, 100 MW is 1e8 J/s. \n\nNumber of fissions per second: 1e8 J/s divided by 3.204e-11 J/fission. \n\nSo 1e8 / 3.204e-11 ≈ (1 / 3.204) * 1e19 ≈ 0.312 * 1e19 = 3.12e18. \n\nSo approximately 3.12e18 fissions per second. The options given are 10^6, 10^12, 10^18, 10^24, 10^30. So 3e18 is 3 times 10^18, which is 10^18.5 roughly. But since the options are orders of magnitude, the closest answer is 10^18. However, maybe the problem expects an approximate answer, so 10^18 is the correct choice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy per fission is considered as 200 MeV, but sometimes people approximate 1 MeV as 1.6e-13 J, so 200 MeV would be 3.2e-11 J, which is what I used. So the calculation seems right. \n\nTherefore, the number of fissions per second is approximately 3e18, which is closest to 10^18. So the answer should be 10^18.\n</think>\n\nThe reactor's power is 100 MW, which is \\(10^8\\) J/s. Each fission releases approximately 200 MeV of energy.

{"id": "atomic/2-46", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The question is about the principal sequence of nuclear processes in the sun for energy generation. I remember that the main process is the proton-proton chain, which is different from the CNO cycle. The proton-proton chain is more dominant in stars like the sun. Let me recall the steps.\n\nFirst, two protons fuse to form deuterium. But wait, protons are both positively charged, so they need to overcome Coulomb repulsion. Quantum tunneling allows this. The first step is p + p → deuteron + positron + neutrino. Wait, the exact products might be a deuterium nucleus (²H), a positron (e⁺), and a neutrino (ν). So that's the pp I reaction. Then the deuteron fuses with another proton to make helium-3. So ²H + p → ³He + gamma. Then, two ³He nuclei combine to form ⁴He and two protons. So ³He + ³He → ⁴He + 2p. That's the pp chain main steps. But there are different branches. The slowest step here is the initial p + p → deuteron because it's a weak interaction process, which is much slower. That's the bottleneck, the slow link. \n\nNow, the neutrinos produced here: in the first step, the pp reaction, the neutrino produced has a spectrum up to about 0.42 MeV. But the mean energy would be lower. Let me think. The average neutrino energy from the pp reaction is around 0.26 MeV. But there are other reactions in the chain. For example, in the pp chain, there's also the pep reaction (p + e⁻ + p → ²H + ν), which produces a higher energy neutrino, around 1.44 MeV, but that's much rarer. The majority are the pp neutrinos with lower energy. But the question says the principal component, which would be the pp neutrinos. So their mean energy is about 0.26 MeV. \n\nNext, the expected number flux at Earth. The solar constant is given as 1 kW/m². The sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion, where each reaction releases energy. The total power output of the sun is about 3.8e26 W. But how does that relate to neutrino flux? Each fusion reaction in the pp chain releases energy, and for each ⁴He produced, there are two neutrinos (since each pp reaction leading to ²H produces a neutrino, and each ⁴He requires two pp reactions). Wait, let me check. The overall pp chain produces two neutrinos per four protons consumed (since four protons make one ⁴He, but two protons are converted into neutrons via beta-plus decay, each producing a neutrino). Wait, in the pp I chain, the first step is p + p → ²H + e⁺ + ν. Then another p + ²H → ³He. Then two ³He → ⁴He + 2p. So for each ⁴He produced, there are two neutrinos (since each ²H comes from a pp reaction, and each pp reaction gives a neutrino). So per ⁴He, two neutrinos. The energy released per ⁴He is about 26.7 MeV. But the total energy of the sun comes from these reactions. The solar constant is the power per square meter at Earth, which is 1 kW/m². The total power is then solar constant multiplied by the area of a sphere with radius 1 AU. Let's compute that. 1 AU is about 1.5e11 meters. The area is 4πr² = 4 * π * (1.5e11)^2 ≈ 2.83e23 m². So total power is 1e3 W/m² * 2.83e23 m² ≈ 2.83e26 W. Wait, but the actual solar luminosity is about 3.8e26 W. Close enough for estimation. \n\nEach reaction (producing ⁴He) releases about 26.7 MeV. Let's convert that to joules. 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 26.7 MeV = 26.7e6 * 1.6e-19 = 4.27e-12 J per reaction. The number of reactions per second is total power divided by energy per reaction: 3.8e26 W / 4.27e-12 J ≈ 8.9e37 reactions per second. Each reaction produces two neutrinos, so total neutrino production is 1.78e38 neutrinos per second. These neutrinos are emitted in all directions. The flux at Earth is the number per second divided by the area of the sphere at 1 AU. So flux Φ = 1.78e38 / (4π*(1.5e11)^2) ≈ 1.78e38 / (2.83e23) ≈ 6.3e14 neutrinos per square meter per second. But wait, let me check. The standard solar neutrino flux is about 7e10 neutrinos per cm² per second, which is 7e14 per m² per second. So that matches. So the expected number flux is around 7e14 m⁻² s⁻¹. But the exact value might depend on the model. The principal component is the pp neutrinos, so their flux is about that number. \n\nFor part (a), the principal sequence is the proton-proton chain, slow link is the initial p-p fusion, mean neutrino energy ~0.26 MeV, flux ~7e14 m⁻² s⁻¹.\n\nNow part (b). The minor reactions that generate higher energy neutrinos. The Homestake experiment detects ⁸B neutrinos. These come from a side branch in the pp chain. Let me recall. In the sun, sometimes ³He can fuse with ⁴He to make ⁷Be. Then ⁷Be can capture a proton to become ⁸B, which beta-decays into ⁸Be* + e⁺ + ν. The ⁸Be* then splits into two ⁴He. The neutrinos from ⁸B decay have higher energies, up to around 15 MeV. The flux of these is much lower, about 1e7 m⁻² s⁻¹. The Homestake experiment uses Cl-37, which has a threshold of about 0.814 MeV for the reaction ν + ³⁷Cl → e⁻ + ³⁷Ar. So the higher energy ⁸B neutrinos can trigger this, while the pp neutrinos are mostly below threshold. The experiment found a deficit compared to predictions, which was the solar neutrino problem. The findings suggested that neutrinos oscillate between flavors, implying they have mass, which was confirmed later. But the initial experiment detected about 1/3 of the expected flux, leading to the discovery of neutrino oscillations.\n</think>\n\n(a) The principal sequence of nuclear processes in the Sun is the **proton-proton (pp) chain**:\n1. \\( p + p \\rightarrow \\, ^2\\text{H} + e^+ + \\nu_e \\) (pp reaction, produces low-energy neutrinos).\n2. \\( ^2\\text{H} + p \\rightarrow \\, ^3\\text{He} + \\gamma \\).\n3. \\( ^3\\text{He} + ^3\\text{He} \\rightarrow \\, ^4\\text{He} + 2p \\).\n\nThe **slow link** is the initial \\( p + p \\) fusion due to the weak interaction governing the conversion of a proton to a neutron.

{"id": "atomic/2-12", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The problem says that the masses of isobars in the same isospin multiplet can be written as the expectation value of a mass operator M = a + bT_z + cT_z². I need to derive this formula. Hmm, isobars are nuclei with the same mass number but different protons and neutrons, right? And isospin multiplets have the same total isospin T but different T_z values. \n\nSo, the idea is that the mass depends on T_z. Since they're in the same multiplet, they share the same T. The mass operator should be a function that's the same for all members of the multiplet, but depends on T_z. Now, in quantum mechanics, operators can be expressed in terms of Casimir operators and other generators. The isospin generators are T², T_z, etc. \n\nWait, the mass formula is an expectation value. So for a state with definite T and T_z, the expectation value of M would be ⟨M⟩ = a + b⟨T_z⟩ + c⟨T_z²⟩. But since all states in the multiplet have the same T, T² is T(T+1), which is a constant. However, the problem's formula doesn't have a T² term. Hmm, maybe the mass operator is constructed from terms that are scalars in isospin space?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mass operator is expanded in terms of the available operators. Since the multiplet has states with different T_z, the mass splitting within the multiplet can be due to terms that depend on T_z. The most general form would be a linear combination of terms up to quadratic in T_z. But why quadratic?\n\nIn nuclear physics, the isobaric mass formula often includes terms like the Coulomb energy, which is proportional to Z², and symmetry energy terms. But here, maybe it's a more general approach. Let's think group theoretically. The isospin group is SU(2), and operators can be constructed from the generators. The mass operator should be a scalar under isospin rotations if the strong interaction is isospin symmetric. But electromagnetic interactions break isospin symmetry, so terms that depend on T_z (which is related to charge) would appear.\n\nSo, the dominant isospin-symmetric part would be the a term, which is the same for all members. Then, the isospin-breaking terms would be linear and quadratic in T_z. The linear term could come from the Coulomb energy, which is roughly proportional to the number of protons, which relates to T_z. The quadratic term might come from other effects, like the symmetry energy in the liquid drop model, which depends on (N-Z)², which is related to (2T_z)². \n\nBut how to derive this formula? Let's consider that the mass operator M must be a function of the isospin variables. Since the multiplet has fixed T, the operator can depend on T_z. The most general form up to second order in T_z would be M = a + bT_z + cT_z². Since T² is fixed (T(T+1)), we don't need to include it as a separate term because it's a constant for the multiplet. So, the expectation value ⟨M⟩ for a state with specific T_z would be a + bT_z + cT_z². That makes sense. Therefore, the formula is derived by considering the mass operator as a second-order polynomial in T_z, with coefficients determined by the physics (Coulomb, symmetry energy, etc.).\n\nFor part (b), the question is how large must the isospin be to test the formula experimentally. The formula has terms up to T_z². If the isospin T is such that the multiplet includes different T_z values, then to determine the coefficients a, b, c, we need at least three data points (masses) from the same multiplet. Since T_z can range from -T to +T, the number of members in the multiplet is 2T + 1. To have three different T_z values, we need 2T +1 ≥3, so T≥1. Therefore, the isospin must be at least 1 to have three members (T_z = -1, 0, +1) to fit the three parameters a, b, c. If T=1/2, the multiplet has only two members (T_z = -1/2, +1/2), which is insufficient to determine three parameters.

{"id": "atomic/1-35", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to tackle part (a) first. The question is asking me to derive the energy levels of the hydrogen atom using Coulomb's law and the simple quantization of angular momentum. Hmm, I remember that the Bohr model does exactly that. Let me recall the steps.\n\nStarting with Coulomb's law: the electrostatic force between the electron and proton is F = (e²)/(4πε₀r²). Since the electron is in a circular orbit, this force provides the centripetal acceleration. So, setting Coulomb's force equal to the centripetal force: (e²)/(4πε₀r²) = (mv²)/r. That simplifies to e²/(4πε₀r) = mv². \n\nNow, the total energy of the electron is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. The kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², and the potential energy is -e²/(4πε₀r). So total energy E = (1/2)mv² - e²/(4πε₀r). From the earlier equation, mv² = e²/(4πε₀r), so substituting that into E gives E = (1/2)(e²/(4πε₀r)) - e²/(4πε₀r) = -e²/(8πε₀r). So E depends on r.\n\nBut how do we find r? Bohr's quantization condition comes in here. He postulated that angular momentum L is quantized: L = nħ, where n is an integer. Angular momentum for a circular orbit is L = mvr. So mvr = nħ. \n\nFrom the earlier equation, mv² = e²/(4πε₀r), so v = e/(sqrt(4πε₀ m r)). Let me solve for v. Wait, maybe rearrange the angular momentum equation: v = nħ/(m r). Substitute this into the expression from the force equation. Let's see:\n\nFrom Coulomb's law and centripetal force: mv² = e²/(4πε₀r). Substitute v = nħ/(m r):\n\nm (n²ħ²)/(m² r²) = e²/(4πε₀r)\n\nSimplify left side: (n²ħ²)/(m r²) = e²/(4πε₀ r)\n\nMultiply both sides by r²:\n\nn²ħ²/(m) = e² r/(4πε₀)\n\nSolve for r:\n\nr = (4πε₀ n² ħ²)/(m e²)\n\nSo the radius r is proportional to n². That's the Bohr radius for each energy level.\n\nNow substitute this r back into the energy expression E = -e²/(8πε₀r). Let's compute that:\n\nE = -e²/(8πε₀) * [m e²/(4πε₀ n² ħ²)] \n\nWait, substituting r into E:\n\nE = -e²/(8πε₀) * [1/( (4πε₀ n² ħ²)/(m e²) ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nE = -e²/(8πε₀) * (m e²)/(4πε₀ n² ħ²) )\n\nMultiply the terms:\n\nE = - (m e^4)/( (8πε₀)(4πε₀) n² ħ² ) * 1/(8πε₀ * 4πε₀) )\n\nWait, let me compute the denominator correctly. The denominator is 8πε₀ multiplied by (4πε₀ n² ħ² / m e²). Wait, no, actually, when you take 1/r, which is (m e²)/(4πε₀ n² ħ²). So:\n\nE = -e²/(8πε₀) * (m e²)/(4πε₀ n² ħ²)\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: e² * m e² = m e^4\n\nDenominator: 8πε₀ * 4πε₀ n² ħ² = 32 π² ε₀² n² ħ²\n\nSo E = - (m e^4)/(32 π² ε₀² n² ħ² )\n\nBut I recall that the standard expression for the energy levels is E_n = - (m e^4)/(8 ε₀² h² n²) * (1/(4 π ε₀))^2? Wait, maybe I need to check the constants.\n\nAlternatively, let's recall that ħ = h/(2π), so ħ² = h²/(4π²). Let's substitute that into the denominator:\n\nDenominator: 32 π² ε₀² n² (h²/(4π²)) ) = 32 π² ε₀² n² h²/(4π²) ) = 8 ε₀² n² h²\n\nSo E = - m e^4 / (8 ε₀² n² h²) * (1/(32 π² ε₀² n² ħ²))? Wait, maybe I messed up the substitution.\n\nWait, let's re-express the denominator after substituting ħ = h/(2π):\n\nOriginal denominator after substitution:\n\n32 π² ε₀² n² ħ² = 32 π² ε₀² n² (h²/(4π²)) ) = 32 π² * h²/(4π²) * ε₀² n² = 8 h² ε₀² n²\n\nSo denominator is 8 h² ε₀² n². Then E = - m e^4 / (8 h² ε₀² n² )\n\nBut the standard formula is E_n = - (m e^4)/(8 ε₀² h² n²) * 1/(4 π ε₀)^2? Wait, maybe I need to check the constants again.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the constants. Let me recall Coulomb's law in SI units. The potential energy is -e^2/(4πε₀ r), so when we derived E, we had E = -e²/(8πε₀ r). Then substituting r from Bohr's radius.\n\nWait, Bohr radius a_0 is (4π ε₀ ħ²)/(m e²). So r_n = n² a_0. Then substituting into E:\n\nE = -e²/(8πε₀ r_n) = -e²/(8πε₀ n² a_0) = -e²/(8πε₀ n² (4π ε₀ ħ²)/(m e²)) )\n\nSimplify denominator: 8πε₀ * 4π ε₀ ħ² n² / (m e²) ) = 32 π² ε₀² ħ² n² / (m e²)\n\nSo E = -e² * m e² / (32 π² ε₀² ħ² n² )\n\nWhich is E = - (m e^4)/(32 π² ε₀² ħ² n² )\n\nBut since ħ = h/(2π), ħ² = h²/(4π²), substitute:\n\nE = - (m e^4)/(32 π² ε₀² (h²/(4π²)) n² )\n\nSimplify denominator: 32 π² ε₀² * h²/(4π²) = 8 ε₀² h²\n\nSo E = - (m e^4)/(8 ε₀² h² n² )\n\nBut the standard Rydberg formula is E_n = - (13.6 eV)/n². Let's check if this matches. The Rydberg constant is given by (m e^4)/(8 ε₀² h²). So yes, that's correct. So the energy levels are E_n = - (m e^4)/(8 ε₀² h²) * 1/n². So the derivation checks out.\n\nSo part (a) is done. Now part (b): What gives rise to the doublet structure of the optical spectra from sodium?\n\nHmm, sodium's optical spectra... I remember that the yellow line in sodium is a doublet, around 589 nm. The doublet arises due to spin-orbit coupling. The 3p orbital splits into two levels with different total angular momentum. For a p orbital, l=1, so the electron has spin s=1/2. The total angular momentum j can be l + s = 3/2 or l - s = 1/2. So the 3p level splits into 3p_{3/2} and 3p_{1/2}. When the electron transitions from 3p to 3s (which has l=0, so j=1/2 only), the two possible transitions from the split p levels to the s level give two closely spaced spectral lines, hence the doublet.\n\nSo the answer is spin-orbit interaction causing the splitting of energy levels with the same n and l but different j values.\n</think>\n\n(a) Starting with Coulomb's law and the quantization of angular momentum, the electrostatic force provides centripetal acceleration:  \n\\[\n\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r^2} = \\frac{mv^2}{r} \\implies \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r} = mv^2.\n\\]  \nTotal energy is \\( E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r} = -\\frac{e^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 r} \\).  \nUsing angular momentum quantization \\( L = n\\hbar = mvr \\), solve for \\( r \\):  \n\\[\nr = \\frac{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 n^2 \\hbar^2}{me^2}.\n\\]  \nSubstitute \\( r \\) into \\( E \\):  \n\\[\nE_n = -\\frac{me^4}{8\\varepsilon_0^2 h^2 n^2}.\n\\]  \nThis matches the Bohr model energy levels.  \n\n(b) The doublet structure in sodium's optical spectra arises from **spin-orbit coupling**. The \\( 3p \\) orbital splits into two sublevels (\\( j = 3/2 \\) and \\( j = 1/2 \\)) due to the interaction between the electron’s spin and orbital angular momentum. Transitions from these split \\( 3p \\) levels to the \\( 3s \\) level (\\( j = 1/2 \\)) produce two closely spaced spectral lines.  \n\nFinal answers:  \n(a) \\[\n\\boxed{E_n = -\\frac{me^4}{8\\varepsilon_0^2 h^2 n^2}}\n\\]  \n(b) \\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Spin-orbit interaction splitting } 3p \\text{ into } j = \\frac{3}{2} \\text{ and } j = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ levels}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["E_n = -\\frac{me^4}{8\\varepsilon_0^2 h^2 n^2}", "\\text{Spin-orbit interaction splitting } 3p \\text{ into } j = \\frac{3}{2} \\text{ and } j = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ levels}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "E_n = -\\frac{me^4}{8\\varepsilon_0^2 h^2 n^2}", "expr2": "E_n = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{me^4}{(4\\pi \\varepsilon_0)^2 \\hbar^2 n^2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "-e**4*m/(8*h**2*n**2*varepsilon**2)", "expr2": "-e**4*m/(32*hbar**2*n**2*pi**2*varepsilon**2)"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Spin-orbit interaction splitting } 3p \\text{ into } j = \\frac{3}{2} \\text{ and } j = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ levels}", "expr2": "E_n = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{me^4}{(4\\pi \\varepsilon_0)^2 \\hbar^2 n^2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Spin-orbit interaction splitting } 3p \\text{ into } j = \\frac{3}{2} \\text{ and } j = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ levels}", "expr2": "\\text{The coupling between the orbital and spin angular momenta of the valence electron.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.5}
{"id": "atomic/2-5", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the precession frequency of a nucleus in the Earth's magnetic field. The options given are 10^-1, 10^1, 10^3, 10^5 sec^-1. Hmm, precession frequency... I remember that's related to nuclear magnetic resonance, right? Let me recall the formula for the Larmor frequency. \n\nThe Larmor precession frequency is given by f = γB / (2π), where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and B is the magnetic field strength. The Earth's magnetic field is around 25 to 65 microtesla. Let me check that. Yeah, I think the Earth's magnetic field is roughly on the order of 50 microtesla. So B ≈ 50 μT. \n\nNow, what's the gyromagnetic ratio for a nucleus? For protons, γ is about 2.675 x 10^8 rad/(s·T). Wait, but different nuclei have different γ values. The question just says \"a nucleus,\" so maybe we should consider the proton's gyromagnetic ratio since it's the most common in such contexts. \n\nLet me plug in the numbers. First, convert B from microtesla to tesla: 50 μT = 50 x 10^-6 T. Then, γ is 2.675e8 rad/(s·T). So the angular frequency ω = γB = 2.675e8 * 50e-6. Let me compute that. \n\n2.675e8 * 50e-6 = 2.675 * 50 * 1e2 = 133.75 * 1e2 = 13375 rad/s. Wait, 2.675e8 * 50e-6 = 2.675 * 50 * 1e(8-6) = 133.75 * 1e2 = 13375 rad/s. Then, to get frequency in Hz (cycles per second), divide by 2π. So f = 13375 / (2π) ≈ 13375 / 6.283 ≈ around 2130 Hz. That's approximately 2 x 10^3 Hz. So 10^3 sec^-1. \n\nLooking at the options, 10^3 is one of them. Let me double-check the Earth's magnetic field. If it's lower, say 25 μT, then 2.675e8 * 25e-6 = 2.675 *25 *1e2 = 66.875 *1e2 = 6687.5 rad/s. Divide by 2π: 6687.5 /6.283 ≈ 1064 Hz, which is still around 10^3. If B is 65 μT, then 2.675e8 *65e-6 = 2.675*65*1e2 = 173.875 *1e2 = 17387.5 rad/s. Divide by 2π: ≈ 2768 Hz, still 10^3. So regardless of Earth's field within that range, the frequency is in the 10^3 range. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 10^3 sec^-1.\n</think>\n\nThe precession frequency of a nucleus in the Earth's magnetic field can be calculated using the Larmor frequency formula:  \n\\[\nf = \\frac{\\gamma B}{2\\pi}\n\\]  \nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) (gyromagnetic ratio for a proton) is \\(2.675 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{rad/(s·T)}\\) and \\(B\\) (Earth's magnetic field) is approximately \\(50 \\, \\mu\\text{T} = 50 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{T}\\).  \n\nCalculating the angular frequency:  \n\\[\n\\omega = \\gamma B = (2.675 \\times 10^8) \\times (50 \\times 10^{-6}) = 13,375 \\, \\text{rad/s}.\n\\]  \nConverting to frequency:  \n\\[\nf = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\approx \\frac{13,375}{6.283} \\approx 2,130 \\, \\text{Hz}.\n\\]  \nThis value falls within the \\(10^3 \\, \\text{sec}^{-1}\\) range.

{"id": "atomic/2-2", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to discuss two out of the three experiments mentioned for determining the size of a nucleus. The options are electron scattering, muonic atom energy levels, and isotopic spin multiplet ground state energies. Let me start by recalling what each of these methods involves and how they relate to the nuclear radius.\n\nFirst, electron scattering. I remember that when electrons are fired at a nucleus, they scatter in a way that depends on the charge distribution within the nucleus. The key here is that electrons interact electromagnetically, so they probe the charge distribution. The diffraction pattern from the scattering can be analyzed to find the charge radius. The form factor, which is the Fourier transform of the charge distribution, is measured. The radius is related to the minimum in the diffraction pattern or the slope of the form factor at low momentum transfer. The formula might involve something like the root mean square (rms) charge radius, which comes from the form factor's behavior as the momentum transfer approaches zero.\n\nSecond, muonic atoms. Muons are like heavy electrons, so when they replace electrons in an atom, they orbit much closer to the nucleus. The energy levels of muonic atoms are more sensitive to the nuclear size because the muon's wavefunction has a significant overlap with the nucleus. The Lamb shift in hydrogen is similar, but for muonic atoms, the effect is larger. The energy levels depend on the electric potential inside the nucleus, which is affected by the charge distribution. By measuring the transition energies between energy levels (like the 2p to 1s transition), you can determine the nuclear charge radius. The finite size of the nucleus causes a shift in these energy levels compared to a point nucleus. The calculation would involve solving the Dirac equation for a muon in the nuclear Coulomb potential, considering the charge distribution's extent.\n\nThird, isotopic spin multiplets. This one is a bit trickier. Isotopic spin (isospin) multiplets refer to nuclei that are in the same isospin multiplet but differ in their neutron and proton numbers. The ground state energies of these nuclei should be similar if isospin symmetry holds. However, the Coulomb interaction breaks this symmetry because protons repel each other. The difference in Coulomb energy between the members of the multiplet can be related to the nuclear radius. The Coulomb energy depends on the charge radius, so by comparing the actual energy differences with theoretical predictions (which include the Coulomb term), you can extract the radius. The formula for Coulomb energy in a nucleus is something like (3e²/5)(Z²)/(4πε₀R), where R is the radius. So measuring the energy difference between isobars (same mass number, different Z) allows calculation of R.\n\nNow, the question asks to discuss two of these. Let me pick electron scattering and muonic atoms first. For electron scattering, the measured quantity is the differential cross-section as a function of scattering angle (or momentum transfer q). The cross-section shows diffraction minima, and the position of the first minimum gives the radius via the relation q·R ≈ π (or similar, maybe using a more precise formula like R ≈ 4.49/q_min for a uniform charge distribution). The form factor F(q) is measured, and the rms radius is obtained from the slope of F(q²) as q² approaches zero: ⟨r²⟩ = -6ħ² (dF/dq²) at q²=0.\n\nFor muonic atoms, the measured quantity is the transition energy between specific energy levels (like 2p to 1s). The energy shift due to the finite nuclear size (compared to a point charge) is calculated using perturbation theory. The muon spends more time inside the nucleus, so the potential it experiences is different. The leading-order correction to the energy levels depends on the mean square charge radius ⟨r²⟩. The measured transition energy is compared to the theoretical prediction with the finite size correction, allowing extraction of ⟨r²⟩ and hence the radius R = sqrt(⟨r²⟩).\n\nAlternatively, if I were to discuss isotopic spin multiplets, the measured quantity is the ground state energy difference between nuclei in the same isospin multiplet. The main contribution to the energy difference comes from the Coulomb repulsion. The formula for the Coulomb energy is (3e²/(5(4πε₀R))) * (Z² - Z') where Z and Z' are the proton numbers of the two nuclei. By knowing the energy difference from experiments and accounting for other effects (like symmetry energy), one can solve for R. However, this method might be less direct because other factors contribute to the binding energy difference, but the Coulomb term is dominant and depends on R.\n\nSo, the question specifies two methods. Let me choose (a) electron scattering and (b) muonic atoms. The physical quantities measured are:\n\nFor (a) electron scattering: The differential cross-section (as a function of momentum transfer q), from which the form factor is extracted. The form factor's dependence on q gives the charge distribution's Fourier transform. The rms charge radius is determined from the slope of the form factor at low q.\n\nFor (b) muonic atoms: The transition energies between atomic energy levels (e.g., 2p-1s). The deviation from the point nucleus energy levels is used to calculate the mean square charge radius, which gives the nuclear radius.\n\nBoth methods relate to the charge radius because they depend on the electric charge distribution. The isotopic spin method relates more to the charge radius as well, since Coulomb energy depends on proton distribution.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nElectron scattering measures the form factor via differential cross-section, leading to rms charge radius. Muonic atoms measure energy shifts in transitions, which depend on the charge radius. Both relate to the charge radius through different physical quantities (form factor vs. energy level shifts).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the nuclear radius, two experimental methods and their measured quantities are discussed:\n\n1. **Electron Scattering (a):**  \n   - **Physical Quantity Measured:** The differential cross-section \\( \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} \\) as a function of momentum transfer \\( q \\).  \n   - **Relation to Nuclear Radius:**  \n     The cross-section is analyzed to extract the **charge form factor** \\( F(q^2) \\), which is the Fourier transform of the nuclear charge distribution.

{"id": "atomic/1-32", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which of the options (a), (b), or (c) correctly describes the Lamb shift. Let me start by recalling what the Lamb shift is. From what I remember, the Lamb shift is a small difference in energy between two energy levels in the hydrogen atom that were originally predicted to be at the same energy by the Dirac equation. Specifically, I think it's between the 2s and 2p orbitals, but maybe the question here is between 1s and 2s? Wait, the options say (a) a splitting between the 1s and 2s. Hmm. Wait, no, the Lamb shift is between states with the same principal quantum number but different orbital angular momentum. For example, the 2S and 2P states. But in the traditional Lamb shift, it's the 2S₁/₂ and 2P₁/₂ levels. Wait, but Dirac's theory predicted those to have the same energy, but experiments showed a slight shift. So the Lamb shift refers to that splitting. So option (a) is talking about 1s and 2s. Those are different principal levels (n=1 vs n=2), so their splitting is just the normal energy difference. The Lamb shift is a splitting within the same n but different l. So (a) is incorrect.\n\nThen, the cause. The Lamb shift is explained by quantum electrodynamics (QED). The main cause is the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field, which is option (b). Vacuum fluctuations lead to the electron interacting with virtual photons, causing a shift in energy levels. Thomas precession, option (c), is a relativistic effect in the context of spin-orbit coupling. Wait, Thomas precession is part of the explanation for the spin-orbit interaction in the fine structure of hydrogen. But the Lamb shift is a separate effect beyond the fine structure, so it's not caused by Thomas precession. Therefore, (c) is incorrect. So the correct answer should be (b).\n</think>\n\nThe Lamb shift refers to the small energy difference between quantum states in hydrogen that were originally predicted to be degenerate by the Dirac equation.

{"id": "atomic/2-15", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Starting with part (a), the magnetic moment operator for a nucleus with A nucleons. I remember that each nucleon (proton or neutron) contributes to the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment operator for a single nucleon is given by the gyromagnetic ratio multiplied by its spin. For protons, the gyromagnetic ratio is the orbital part plus the intrinsic spin part. Wait, protons have charge, so their orbital motion contributes to the magnetic moment. But neutrons, being neutral, only have the spin contribution. Hmm, but the problem states to consider the nucleus as a collection of neutrons and protons with their free moments. So maybe each nucleon's magnetic moment is just their intrinsic spin moment plus any orbital contribution? Wait, but in the shell model, the magnetic moment is calculated using the Schmidt model, which includes both orbital and spin parts. However, the problem says \"having their free moments,\" which probably means we take the experimental magnetic moments of the proton and neutron as given. Wait, but the magnetic moment operator for each nucleon would then be μ_p for protons and μ_n for neutrons times their spin? Or is there a factor here?\n\nWait, the magnetic dipole moment operator for a nucleon is given by μ = g * (eħ/(2m)) * σ/2, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio. For protons, the g-factor is g_p = 5.586 (which is μ_p = g_p * μ_N / 2, since μ_N is eħ/(2m_p)), but wait, actually μ_p = (g_p / 2) * μ_N, similarly for the neutron μ_n = (g_n / 2) * μ_N, where g_n is -3.826. But the problem gives the magnetic moments as -1.913 μ_N for the neutron and +2.793 μ_N for the proton. So those are the experimental values, which include both spin and any other contributions. But if we are to write the operator as a sum over all nucleons, each proton contributes μ_p times some spin component, and each neutron contributes μ_n times their spin component. Wait, but the magnetic moment operator is a vector, but maybe here we're considering the z-component for simplicity. So the operator would be the sum over all protons of μ_p σ_z^(i) plus the sum over all neutrons of μ_n σ_z^(i). Wait, but protons and neutrons have different charges, but the problem states to take their free moments. So perhaps the operator is:\n\nμ_hat = sum_{i=1 to A} [ μ_p (1 + τ_z^(i))/2 + μ_n (1 - τ_z^(i))/2 ] σ_z^(i)\n\nWait, here τ_z is the isospin operator, where for a proton, τ_z = +1, and for a neutron, τ_z = -1. So (1 + τ_z)/2 is 1 for protons and 0 for neutrons, and (1 - τ_z)/2 is 0 for protons and 1 for neutrons. Therefore, this expression would correctly pick out the proton or neutron magnetic moment contribution for each nucleon. So the operator would be:\n\nμ_hat = μ_p sum_{protons} σ_z^(i) + μ_n sum_{neutrons} σ_z^(i)\n\nBut using isospin formalism, this can be written as:\n\nμ_hat = sum_{i=1}^A [ μ_p ( (1 + τ_z^(i))/2 ) + μ_n ( (1 - τ_z^(i))/2 ) ] σ_z^(i)\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\nμ_hat = sum_{i=1}^A [ (μ_p + μ_n)/2 + (μ_p - μ_n)/2 τ_z^(i) ] σ_z^(i)\n\nSo that's the operator expressed in terms of isoscalar and isovector components. Wait, but part (a) just asks to write down the operator. So maybe the answer is:\n\nμ_hat = μ_p sum_{i=1}^A ( (1 + τ_z^(i))/2 ) σ_z^(i) + μ_n sum_{i=1}^A ( (1 - τ_z^(i))/2 ) σ_z^(i)\n\nAlternatively, combining terms:\n\nμ_hat = sum_{i=1}^A [ μ_p P_p(i) + μ_n P_n(i) ] σ_z^(i)\n\nWhere P_p and P_n are projectors onto proton and neutron states. But since the problem mentions isospin in part (b), maybe part (a) is written in terms of isospin. But perhaps part (a) is just the straightforward sum over protons and neutrons with their respective moments. So the answer would be:\n\nThe magnetic moment operator is the sum over all nucleons, with each proton contributing μ_p σ_z^{(i)} and each neutron contributing μ_n σ_z^{(i)}. Therefore,\n\nμ = μ_p ∑_{i ∈ protons} σ_z^{(i)} + μ_n ∑_{i ∈ neutrons} σ_z^{(i)}\n\nBut since protons and neutrons can be distinguished by isospin, we can write this using the isospin projection operators. So in terms of τ_z, which is +1 for protons and -1 for neutrons, the projectors are (1 + τ_z)/2 for protons and (1 - τ_z)/2 for neutrons. Therefore, the operator becomes:\n\nμ = ∑_{i=1}^A [ μ_p ( (1 + τ_z^{(i)})/2 ) + μ_n ( (1 - τ_z^{(i)})/2 ) ] σ_z^{(i)}\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nμ = ( (μ_p + μ_n)/2 ) ∑_{i=1}^A σ_z^{(i)} + ( (μ_p - μ_n)/2 ) ∑_{i=1}^A τ_z^{(i)} σ_z^{(i)}\n\nSo that's the operator split into isoscalar and isovector parts, which probably leads into part (b). But part (a) just asks to write down the operator. So maybe the answer is as above.\n\nMoving to part (b), introducing isospin and determining isoscalar and isovector operators. Isoscalar operators are those that are invariant under isospin rotations, i.e., proportional to the identity in isospin space, while isovector operators transform as vectors in isospin space. In the expression from part (a), the operator has two terms: one proportional to ∑σ_z (isoscalar, since it doesn't involve τ) and another proportional to ∑τ_z σ_z (isovector, since τ is a vector in isospin space). Wait, but in the expression above, the first term is (μ_p + μ_n)/2 times ∑σ_z, which is isoscalar (since it's τ-independent), and the second term is (μ_p - μ_n)/2 times ∑τ_z σ_z, which is isovector (since τ_z is the third component of isospin). So the isoscalar operator is (μ_p + μ_n)/2 ∑σ_z^{(i)}, and the isovector operator is (μ_p - μ_n)/2 ∑τ_z^{(i)} σ_z^{(i)}. The problem asks for their relative sizes. The coefficients are (μ_p + μ_n)/2 and (μ_p - μ_n)/2. Plugging in the given values: μ_p = 2.793 μ_N, μ_n = -1.913 μ_N. So μ_p + μ_n = 2.793 -1.913 = 0.880 μ_N, so (μ_p + μ_n)/2 ≈ 0.440 μ_N. The isovector coefficient is (2.793 +1.913)/2 = (4.706)/2 ≈ 2.353 μ_N. Therefore, the isovector term is larger than the isoscalar term. So their relative sizes are (μ_p - μ_n)/2 divided by (μ_p + μ_n)/2, which is (μ_p - μ_n)/(μ_p + μ_n) ≈ (4.706)/(0.880) ≈ 5.35. So the isovector term is about 5.35 times larger than the isoscalar term. Therefore, the isovector component dominates.\n\nFor part (c), we need to show that the sum of magnetic moments in mirror nuclei (T=1/2) is given by that expression. Mirror nuclei have the same A but with proton and neutron numbers swapped. For example, ^3H and ^3He. Since they are mirror nuclei, their isospin projections are opposite. Let's denote the two nuclei as having T_z = +1/2 and T_z = -1/2. The magnetic moment operator, as derived, has isoscalar and isovector parts. The total magnetic moment expectation value for each nucleus would be the sum of the isoscalar and isovector contributions. For a nucleus with T=1/2 and T_z = ±1/2, the expectation value of the isovector operator would involve the matrix element of ∑τ_z σ_z. Since the isovector operator is proportional to τ_z σ_z, and the nucleus has isospin T=1/2, the expectation value of τ_z would be T_z. Wait, but τ_z for each nucleon is +1 for protons and -1 for neutrons. The total T_z is (Z - N)/2. For mirror nuclei, one has T_z = +1/2 and the other -1/2. Let’s denote the two nuclei as A (T_z = +1/2) and B (T_z = -1/2). The magnetic moments μ_A and μ_B would each be the expectation value of the operator. Let's compute μ_A + μ_B. The isoscalar part contributes the same to both, since it doesn't depend on isospin. The isovector part would contribute with opposite signs. Let me formalize this. The magnetic moment operator is μ = μ_0 + μ_1, where μ_0 is the isoscalar part and μ_1 is the isovector part. Then, for each nucleus, the expectation value is ⟨μ⟩ = ⟨μ_0⟩ + ⟨μ_1⟩. For nucleus A (T_z = +1/2), ⟨μ_1⟩ would be proportional to ⟨T_z⟩, and for nucleus B (T_z = -1/2), ⟨μ_1⟩ would be proportional to ⟨T_z⟩. But wait, the isovector operator is ∑ τ_z^(i) σ_z^(i). The expectation value of this operator in a state with total isospin T and T_z would depend on the isospin and spin structure. However, since the nucleus has T=1/2, the matrix element of ∑ τ_z^(i) σ_z^(i) would involve coupling of isospin and spin. But perhaps we can use the fact that for a single-particle operator, the expectation value in a state with total spin J and isospin T can be expressed using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. Alternatively, considering that the nucleus is a T=1/2 state, the expectation value of the isovector operator (which is a scalar in spin space and isovector in isospin space) would be proportional to the expectation value of T_z. Wait, but the operator ∑ τ_z^(i) σ_z^(i) is a product of isovector (τ_z) and spin vector (σ_z). So the operator is a scalar in spin space (since σ_z is the z-component) and a scalar in isospin space? Wait, no. τ_z is the z-component of isospin, so ∑ τ_z^(i) σ_z^(i) is a product of two vectors in their respective spaces. But since we're taking the z-components, maybe it's a scalar under rotations around the z-axis, but not necessarily a scalar overall. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler approach. Let's consider that the magnetic moment operator can be written as:\n\nμ = (μ_p + μ_n)/2 ∑ σ_z^{(i)} + (μ_p - μ_n)/2 ∑ τ_z^{(i)} σ_z^{(i)}\n\nThe expectation value for a nucleus would then be:\n\n⟨μ⟩ = (μ_p + μ_n)/2 ⟨∑σ_z^{(i)}⟩ + (μ_p - μ_n)/2 ⟨∑τ_z^{(i)} σ_z^{(i)}⟩\n\nNow, for mirror nuclei A and B, which are related by swapping protons and neutrons, their isospin T=1/2 states with T_z = ±1/2. Let's denote nucleus A as T_z = +1/2 (more protons) and nucleus B as T_z = -1/2 (more neutrons). The sum μ_A + μ_B would be:\n\nμ_A + μ_B = (μ_p + μ_n)/2 [⟨A|∑σ_z|A⟩ + ⟨B|∑σ_z|B⟩] + (μ_p - μ_n)/2 [⟨A|∑τ_z σ_z|A⟩ + ⟨B|∑τ_z σ_z|B⟩]\n\nAssuming that the spin structure is the same for both nuclei (since they are mirrors), the expectation value of ∑σ_z would be the same for both, so ⟨A|∑σ_z|A⟩ = ⟨B|∑σ_z|B⟩ = ⟨∑σ_z⟩. Therefore, the first term becomes (μ_p + μ_n)/2 * 2 ⟨∑σ_z⟩ = (μ_p + μ_n) ⟨∑σ_z⟩.\n\nFor the second term, the expectation values of ∑τ_z σ_z in A and B would be opposite. Because τ_z for each nucleon in A is +1 (proton) or -1 (neutron), and in B, it's the opposite. So ⟨A|∑τ_z σ_z|A⟩ = ⟨∑τ_z σ_z⟩_A and ⟨B|∑τ_z σ_z|B⟩ = ⟨∑τ_z σ_z⟩_B. But since B is the mirror, each τ_z is flipped. So if in A, the sum is S, then in B, it would be -S. Therefore, the sum S + (-S) = 0. Wait, but this would make the second term cancel out. But according to the expression we need to prove, the sum of the magnetic moments is J + (μ_p + μ_n - 1/2)⟨∑σ_z⟩. Hmm, this suggests that the isovector part cancels in the sum, but the given expression includes a term involving ⟨∑σ_z⟩. Wait, maybe my assumption is incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expectation value of ∑τ_z σ_z in nucleus A is related to the total spin J and isospin T. For a nucleus with T=1/2 and T_z=+1/2, the expectation value of ∑τ_z^(i) σ_z^(i) would involve the coupling of isospin and spin. If the wavefunction is such that the isospin and spin are coupled to total T=1/2 and J, then perhaps the expectation value can be expressed in terms of T_z and J. Let me recall that for a single-particle operator ∑ τ_z^(i) σ_z^(i), the expectation value in a state with total spin J and isospin T might be proportional to T_z J_z. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the nucleus is in a state with T=1/2, the expectation value of the isovector operator ∑ τ_z σ_z would be proportional to T_z times some spin expectation value. Let's suppose that ⟨∑ τ_z σ_z⟩ = c T_z ⟨∑ σ_z⟩, where c is a constant. Then, for nucleus A (T_z=+1/2) and B (T_z=-1/2), the sum would be c (1/2) ⟨∑σ_z⟩ + c (-1/2) ⟨∑σ_z⟩ = 0. But this would eliminate the isovector contribution in the sum. However, the given expression in part (c) has a term involving (μ_p + μ_n - 1/2)⟨∑σ_z⟩. Let's see. The sum μ_A + μ_B would then be:\n\nμ_A + μ_B = (μ_p + μ_n) ⟨∑σ_z⟩ + (μ_p - μ_n)/2 [⟨A|∑τ_z σ_z|A⟩ + ⟨B|∑τ_z σ_z|B⟩]\n\nBut if the isovector terms cancel, then μ_A + μ_B = (μ_p + μ_n) ⟨∑σ_z⟩. But the given expression is J + (μ_p + μ_n - 1/2)⟨∑σ_z⟩. So where does the J come from? Wait, J is the total nuclear spin. The total spin J is the expectation value of the total angular momentum. But the magnetic moment operator is proportional to the spin, so maybe there's a contribution from the orbital angular momentum? Wait, but the problem states to consider the nucleus as a collection of neutrons and protons with their free moments, which for the proton includes the orbital contribution? Wait, no. The problem says \"having their free moments,\" which are given as μ_p and μ_n. The free proton's magnetic moment includes both spin and any orbital contributions, but in reality, the proton's magnetic moment is predominantly spin, but in the nucleus, the orbital motion might be considered. However, the problem states to take the free moments, so perhaps the magnetic moment operator is only the spin part with the given μ_p and μ_n. Wait, but the magnetic moment of a free proton is μ_p = g_p (eħ/(2m_p)) (s), where g_p is the proton's g-factor. Similarly for the neutron. But in the nucleus, the magnetic moment operator would be the sum over all nucleons of their individual magnetic moments. So each proton contributes μ_p σ_z^{(i)} and each neutron μ_n σ_z^{(i)}. Therefore, the total magnetic moment operator is μ = μ_p ∑_{protons} σ_z^{(i)} + μ_n ∑_{neutrons} σ_z^{(i)}. But when considering isospin, this can be written as μ = (μ_p (1 + τ_z)/2 + μ_n (1 - τ_z)/2) ∑ σ_z^{(i)}. Wait, no, per nucleon, the contribution is [μ_p (1 + τ_z)/2 + μ_n (1 - τ_z)/2] σ_z^{(i)}. Summing over all nucleons gives the total operator. So expanding this gives the isoscalar and isovector terms as before.\n\nNow, for mirror nuclei, the expectation value of τ_z for each nucleon would be different. Let's consider that in nucleus A (T_z = +1/2), the number of protons is (Z) and neutrons (N), and in nucleus B, it's swapped. The total T_z = (Z - N)/2 = 1/2 for A and -1/2 for B. The sum of their magnetic moments would involve the isoscalar part, which is the same for both, and the isovector part, which has opposite signs. Therefore, when summed, the isovector parts cancel, and the isoscalar parts add. But according to the given expression, the sum is J + (μ_p + μ_n - 1/2)⟨∑σ_z⟩. Wait, where does the J come from? The total spin J is the expectation value of the total angular momentum. But the magnetic moment operator here is only the spin part. Wait, but in reality, the magnetic moment also has an orbital component. However, the problem states to consider the nucleons as having their free moments, which for the proton includes the orbital contribution? Or is the orbital angular momentum neglected here? The problem might be assuming that the magnetic moment is purely from the intrinsic spin, which is not exactly true, but given the way the question is phrased, perhaps we are to ignore orbital contributions. Alternatively, maybe the orbital angular momentum is considered to contribute to the total spin J. Wait, but J is the total nuclear spin, which includes both orbital and spin angular momentum. However, in the shell model, the magnetic moment is calculated using the total angular momentum j = l + s. But the problem states to use the free moments, which are given. So perhaps the orbital motion is already accounted for in the free moments. This is a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nThe magnetic moment operator as written in part (a) is based on the free moments of the proton and neutron, which include their intrinsic spin and any other contributions (like orbital for protons). But in the nucleus, the orbital motion of the protons would contribute to the magnetic moment. However, the problem says to consider the nucleus as a collection of neutrons and protons with their free moments, implying that each nucleon's contribution is just their free moment times their spin. But this might not include the orbital part. Wait, the free proton's magnetic moment is μ_p = 2.793 μ_N, which is due to its spin and internal structure. In the nucleus, the proton's orbital motion would contribute an additional term. But the problem says to take the free moments, so perhaps we are to ignore the orbital contribution in the nucleus and just use the intrinsic moments. That would mean the magnetic moment operator is μ = μ_p ∑_{protons} σ_z^{(i)} + μ_n ∑_{neutrons} σ_z^{(i)}. Then, the expectation value of μ for a nucleus would be μ_p ⟨∑σ_z for protons⟩ + μ_n ⟨∑σ_z for neutrons⟩. But in terms of isospin, this can be written as:\n\n⟨μ⟩ = μ_p ⟨∑ (1 + τ_z^{(i)})/2 σ_z^{(i)} ⟩ + μ_n ⟨∑ (1 - τ_z^{(i)})/2 σ_z^{(i)} ⟩\n\n= (μ_p + μ_n)/2 ⟨∑σ_z^{(i)}⟩ + (μ_p - μ_n)/2 ⟨∑τ_z^{(i)} σ_z^{(i)}⟩\n\nNow, for mirror nuclei A and B with T=1/2 and T_z=±1/2, the expectation value of ∑τ_z^{(i)} σ_z^{(i)} would be related to T_z and the spin expectation. Let's assume that the nucleus is in a state where the total spin J is the expectation value of the total spin operator. Then, ⟨∑σ_z^{(i)}⟩ would be related to J_z. If the nucleus is polarized along the z-axis, then ⟨J_z⟩ = J. But for a nucleus with spin J, the expectation value of the total spin z-component is J_z = M, where M is the magnetic quantum number. However, if the nucleus is in a state with maximum M=J, then ⟨J_z⟩ = J. But in general, the expectation value of ∑σ_z^{(i)} would depend on the spin structure. However, the problem states to consider the sum of magnetic moments of two mirror nuclei. Let's denote nucleus A (T_z=1/2) and nucleus B (T_z=-1/2). The sum μ_A + μ_B would be:\n\nμ_A + μ_B = (μ_p + μ_n)/2 [⟨A|∑σ_z|A⟩ + ⟨B|∑σ_z|B⟩] + (μ_p - μ_n)/2 [⟨A|∑τ_z σ_z|A⟩ + ⟨B|∑τ_z σ_z|B⟩]\n\nAssuming that the spin structure is the same for both nuclei (since they are mirrors), ⟨A|∑σ_z|A⟩ = ⟨B|∑σ_z|B⟩ = ⟨∑σ_z⟩. Therefore, the first term becomes (μ_p + μ_n) ⟨∑σ_z⟩.\n\nFor the second term, since the isospin projections are opposite, and assuming that the isovector part depends on T_z, we might have ⟨A|∑τ_z σ_z|A⟩ = C and ⟨B|∑τ_z σ_z|B⟩ = -C. Therefore, their sum would be zero. Thus, μ_A + μ_B = (μ_p + μ_n) ⟨∑σ_z⟩. But the expression given in the problem is J + (μ_p + μ_n - 1/2)⟨∑σ_z⟩. So where does the J term come from? This suggests that there's another contribution to the magnetic moment. Wait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum contributes to the magnetic moment. The problem states to consider the nucleus as a collection of nucleons with their free moments, but the free proton's magnetic moment includes both spin and orbital contributions. However, in the nucleus, the orbital motion of the protons would generate an additional magnetic moment. But the problem says to take the free moments, so maybe the orbital contribution is already included in μ_p and μ_n. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the Schmidt model, where the magnetic moment is given by μ = g_l * l + g_s * s, but with g_l and g_s factors. However, the problem states to use the free moments, so perhaps the orbital part is neglected here. Alternatively, maybe the total magnetic moment operator includes the orbital part. Wait, but the given magnetic moments for the proton and neutron are their total moments, which for the proton includes both spin and any quark contributions, but in the nucleus, the orbital motion would be part of the nuclear structure. However, the problem says to consider the nucleus as a collection of nucleons with their free moments, implying that each nucleon's magnetic moment is just their free value times their spin. Therefore, the orbital angular momentum is not considered here. Then why does the final expression include J? Because J is the total nuclear spin, which includes the spin of the nucleons. Wait, but the total spin J is the expectation value of the total angular momentum, which in this case would be the sum of the individual spins (since we're neglecting orbital angular momentum, or considering it as part of the spin? No, orbital angular momentum is separate. This is confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIf the magnetic moment operator is only the spin part, then the expectation value would be proportional to the total spin. However, the problem's given expression includes J, which is the total nuclear spin. So perhaps the magnetic moment operator has a term proportional to the total spin J. Wait, but the operator we derived is a sum over the individual spins. The total spin J is the sum of the individual spins (and orbital angular momenta), but if we're neglecting orbital angular momentum, then J is just the sum of the nucleon spins. Therefore, ⟨∑σ_z^{(i)}⟩ would be 2⟨J_z⟩, since each σ_z is twice the spin (since spin is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix). Wait, σ_z is the Pauli matrix, so for a spin-1/2 particle, the z-component of spin is σ_z/2. Therefore, the total spin operator for a nucleon is s_z = σ_z/2. Therefore, the total spin J_z is (1/2) ∑ σ_z^{(i)}. Therefore, ⟨∑σ_z^{(i)}⟩ = 2⟨J_z⟩. If the nucleus is in a state with maximum J_z = J, then ⟨J_z⟩ = J, so ⟨∑σ_z^{(i)}⟩ = 2J. But this seems inconsistent with the given expression. Wait, let's clarify. The total spin operator for the nucleus is J = ∑ s_i, where s_i = σ_i/2 for each nucleon. Therefore, J_z = (1/2) ∑ σ_z^{(i)}. Therefore, ∑ σ_z^{(i)} = 2 J_z. The expectation value of ∑σ_z^{(i)} in a state with J_z = M is 2M. If the state has maximum M = J, then ⟨∑σ_z^{(i)}⟩ = 2J. However, the problem's expression has J + ... ⟨∑σ_z⟩. So if ⟨∑σ_z⟩ = 2J, then J + ... would be J + ...*2J. But the given expression is J + (μ_p + μ_n - 1/2)⟨∑σ_z⟩. This suggests that there's a term proportional to J and another term proportional to ⟨∑σ_z⟩. But according to our previous analysis, the sum μ_A + μ_B should be (μ_p + μ_n)⟨∑σ_z⟩. To reconcile this, perhaps there's an additional contribution from the orbital angular momentum. Wait, but the problem states to use the free moments, which for the proton includes its intrinsic spin and any other contributions. If the orbital angular momentum is considered part of the nuclear structure, then the magnetic moment operator should include terms from the orbital motion. For protons, the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment is μ_orbital = (e/(2m_p)) l_z, where l_z is the orbital angular momentum. But the problem says to consider the nucleons as having their free moments, which might exclude the orbital part. However, the given expression includes J, which is the total angular momentum, including orbital. This is conflicting. Let me check the given answer format. The expression to show is:\n\nJ + (μ_p + μ_n - 1/2) ⟨∑σ_z^{(i)}⟩\n\nSo the sum of the magnetic moments is equal to J plus a term involving the expectation of ∑σ_z. This suggests that there's a part of the magnetic moment that is proportional to J, and another part proportional to ⟨∑σ_z⟩. But according to our previous analysis, the sum μ_A + μ_B is (μ_p + μ_n)⟨∑σ_z⟩. To get the given expression, we need to have:\n\n(μ_p + μ_n)⟨∑σ_z⟩ = J + (μ_p + μ_n - 1/2)⟨∑σ_z⟩\n\nWhich would imply that:\n\n(μ_p + μ_n)⟨∑σ_z⟩ - (μ_p + μ_n - 1/2)⟨∑σ_z⟩ = J\n\nSimplifying:\n\n(1/2)⟨∑σ_z⟩ = J\n\nBut since J is the total spin, which is ∑ s_i = (1/2)∑σ_z^{(i)}, so J = (1/2)⟨∑σ_z^{(i)}⟩. Therefore, ⟨∑σ_z^{(i)}⟩ = 2J. Substituting back, the sum μ_A + μ_B would be:\n\n(μ_p + μ_n) * 2J = J + (μ_p + μ_n - 1/2) * 2J\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\nJ + 2J(μ_p + μ_n - 1/2) = J[1 + 2(μ_p + μ_n - 1/2)] = J[2(μ_p + μ_n) - 1 + 1] = 2J(μ_p + μ_n)\n\nWhich matches the left-hand side. Therefore, this equality holds if:\n\n(μ_p + μ_n) * 2J = J + (μ_p + μ_n - 1/2) * 2J\n\nDivide both sides by J (assuming J ≠ 0):\n\n2(μ_p + μ_n) = 1 + 2(μ_p + μ_n - 1/2)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 2μ_p + 2μ_n -1 = 2μ_p + 2μ_n\n\nWhich matches the left-hand side. Therefore, the given expression is algebraically consistent. Therefore, the sum of the magnetic moments is indeed J + (μ_p + μ_n - 1/2)⟨∑σ_z⟩, given that ⟨∑σ_z⟩ = 2J. Therefore, substituting ⟨∑σ_z⟩ = 2J into the expression:\n\nJ + (μ_p + μ_n - 1/2)(2J) = J + 2(μ_p + μ_n - 1/2)J = J[1 + 2(μ_p + μ_n - 1/2)] = J[2(μ_p + μ_n) -1 +1] = 2J(μ_p + μ_n)\n\nWhich matches the sum μ_A + μ_B = (μ_p + μ_n)⟨∑σ_z⟩ = (μ_p + μ_n)(2J). Therefore, the given expression is correct. Hence, the sum of the magnetic moments of the two mirror nuclei is as given. Therefore, the key steps are recognizing that the isovector parts cancel in the sum, leaving only the isoscalar term, and relating the expectation value of ∑σ_z to the total spin J. The factor of 1/2 comes from the relation between the total spin and the sum of the individual spins. Therefore, the final expression combines the total spin J with the isoscalar contribution adjusted by the factor (μ_p + μ_n - 1/2).\n</think>\n\n(a) The magnetic moment operator for a nucleus with \\( A \\) nucleons, considering each nucleon's free magnetic moment, is expressed as:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mu} = \\sum_{i=1}^{A} \\left[ \\mu_p \\frac{(1 + \\tau_z^{(i)})}{2} + \\mu_n \\frac{(1 - \\tau_z^{(i)})}{2} \\right] \\sigma_z^{(i)},\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\tau_z^{(i)} = +1 \\) for protons and \\( -1 \\) for neutrons, and \\( \\sigma_z^{(i)} \\) is the Pauli spin matrix for the \\( i \\)-th nucleon.\n\n(b) Introducing isospin \\( \\mathbf{T} \\), the operator splits into isoscalar (independent of \\( \\tau_z \\)) and isovector (proportional to \\( \\tau_z \\)) components:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mu} = \\underbrace{\\frac{\\mu_p + \\mu_n}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{A} \\sigma_z^{(i)}}_{\\text{isoscalar}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{\\mu_p - \\mu_n}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{A} \\tau_z^{(i)} \\sigma_z^{(i)}}_{\\text{isovector}}.\n\\]\nThe relative sizes of the coefficients are \\( \\frac{\\mu_p - \\mu_n}{\\mu_p + \\mu_n} \\approx 5.35 \\), indicating the isovector term dominates.\n\n(c) For mirror nuclei \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) (\\( T = 1/2 \\), \\( T_z = \\pm 1/2 \\)), the isovector contributions cancel in \\( \\mu_A + \\mu_B \\), leaving:\n\\[\n\\mu_A + \\mu_B = (\\mu_p + \\mu_n) \\left\\langle \\sum_{i=1}^{A} \\sigma_z^{(i)} \\right\\rangle.\n\\]\nUsing \\( \\left\\langle \\sum \\sigma_z^{(i)} \\right\\rangle = 2J \\) (where \\( J \\) is the total spin) and rearranging:\n\\[\n\\mu_A + \\mu_B = J + (\\mu_p + \\mu_n - 1/2) \\left\\langle \\sum_{i=1}^{A} \\sigma_z^{(i)} \\right\\rangle.\n\\]\nThus, the sum of magnetic moments is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{J + (\\mu_p + \\mu_n - \\frac{1}{2}) \\left\\langle \\sum_{i=1}^{A} \\sigma_z^{(i)} \\right\\rangle}.\n\\]", "final_answers": ["J + (\\mu_p + \\mu_n - \\frac{1}{2}) \\left\\langle \\sum_{i=1}^{A} \\sigma_z^{(i)} \\right\\rangle"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "J + (\\mu_p + \\mu_n - \\frac{1}{2}) \\left\\langle \\sum_{i=1}^{A} \\sigma_z^{(i)} \\right\\rangle", "expr2": "\\mu = \\sum_{i=1}^{A} (g_l^i l_i + g_s^i S_i)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": "I expected one of these: '_'\n\\sum^{A} (g^i l + g^i S)\n~~~~~~~~~^"}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "J + (\\mu_p + \\mu_n - \\frac{1}{2}) \\left\\langle \\sum_{i=1}^{A} \\sigma_z^{(i)} \\right\\rangle", "expr2": "\\mu_1 + \\mu_2 = J + (\\mu_p + \\mu_n - \\frac{1}{2}) \\left\\langle \\sum_{i=1}^{A} \\sigma_z^{(i)} \\right\\rangle"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "J + 2*mu - 1/2", "expr2": "J + 2*mu - 1/2"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/2-24", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to explain the semiempirical mass formula, right? Let me start by recalling what I know about it. The formula is used to calculate the approximate mass of a nucleus based on the number of protons (Z) and neutrons (A-Z). It's called semiempirical because it combines theoretical models with empirical adjustments to fit experimental data. The formula accounts for various factors that contribute to the binding energy of the nucleus, and since mass is related to binding energy via Einstein's equation, each term in the formula corresponds to a different contribution to the nuclear binding energy.\n\nThe general form of the formula is M(A,Z) = Z*m_proton + (A-Z)*m_neutron - B(A,Z)/c², where B(A,Z) is the binding energy. The binding energy itself is given by several terms: volume term, surface term, Coulomb term, asymmetry term, and pairing term. Each term has a coefficient that's determined empirically. Let me go through each term one by one.\n\nFirst, the volume term. This term represents the binding energy due to the strong nuclear force, which acts between all nucleons (protons and neutrons). Since the strong force is short-ranged, each nucleon interacts only with its nearest neighbors. In a large nucleus, most nucleons are inside and surrounded by others, so the binding energy per nucleon is roughly constant. This leads to a term proportional to the number of nucleons, A. The coefficient here is positive because it contributes to the binding energy (thus reducing the mass). The coefficient is around 15.5 MeV or so, but I need to check the exact value. Wait, the volume term is a positive contribution to the binding energy, so in the mass formula, it would subtract from the total mass. The coefficient for the volume term is usually denoted as a_V, and I think it's approximately 15.5 MeV.\n\nNext is the surface term. Nucleons on the surface of the nucleus have fewer neighbors, so their binding energy contribution is less than those in the interior. This term corrects the volume term by subtracting some energy proportional to the surface area. The surface area of a nucleus is proportional to A^(2/3) since the radius R is proportional to A^(1/3), and surface area is 4πR². Therefore, the surface term is negative (reducing the binding energy compared to the volume term alone) and proportional to -A^(2/3). The coefficient here, a_S, is around 16-17 MeV? Wait, no, I think the surface term coefficient is smaller than the volume term. Wait, maybe the coefficients are such that the volume term is +a_V*A, surface term is -a_S*A^(2/3). So the coefficients are positive, but the surface term subtracts. Let me check: I recall that the volume term is about 15.5 MeV, surface term coefficient is around 16.8 MeV? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me think again. The coefficients are determined empirically, so the actual values might be in the range of 10s of MeV. For example, a_V is around 15.5 MeV, a_S around 16.8 MeV, but I need to confirm. Wait, no, maybe the surface term coefficient is around 17-18 MeV? Hmm, I might be getting confused here. Let me try to remember. The Bethe-Weizsäcker formula coefficients are typically given as a_V ≈ 15.5 MeV, a_S ≈ 16.8 MeV, a_C ≈ 0.715 MeV, a_A ≈ 23 MeV, and a_P ≈ 34 MeV. Wait, but that seems high for the pairing term. Alternatively, different sources might have slightly different values because the formula is semiempirical and different fits give different coefficients. But the standard values are approximately in those ranges.\n\nThird term is the Coulomb term. Protons repel each other due to the Coulomb force, which reduces the binding energy. The Coulomb energy is proportional to the number of proton pairs, which is Z(Z-1)/2, and inversely proportional to the radius. Since radius is proportional to A^(1/3), the Coulomb term is proportional to Z²/A^(1/3). The coefficient here, a_C, is approximately 0.72 MeV. The exact value might be around 0.715 or so. This term is subtracted because the Coulomb repulsion reduces the binding energy, so it adds to the mass.\n\nFourth term is the asymmetry term. This accounts for the Pauli exclusion principle, which favors having roughly equal numbers of protons and neutrons. If there's an imbalance (N ≠ Z), the binding energy decreases. The asymmetry term is proportional to (N-Z)²/A, which can be written as (A-2Z)²/(4A) since N = A - Z. So the term is proportional to (A-2Z)²/A. The coefficient a_A is around 23 MeV. This term is subtracted from the binding energy, so it adds to the mass.\n\nLastly, the pairing term. Nucleons tend to pair up in the nucleus, leading to greater stability (higher binding energy) when the number of protons and/or neutrons is even. The pairing term depends on whether Z and N are even or odd. The term is +a_P/A^(1/2) if both Z and N are even (even-even nuclei), 0 if A is odd (either Z or N is odd), and -a_P/A^(1/2) if both Z and N are odd (odd-odd nuclei). The coefficient a_P is around 12 MeV, but I've seen different values here. Wait, some sources say around 34 MeV divided by A^(3/4), but maybe I'm mixing different versions. Wait, the standard formula uses a_P/A^(1/2). Let me check. The pairing term is usually given as ±δ, where δ = a_P / A^(1/2). The coefficient a_P is around 12 MeV if we take δ = 12 MeV / sqrt(A) for even-even, and -12 MeV / sqrt(A) for odd-odd. But some sources might have different values. Alternatively, sometimes the pairing term is written as a_P * (±1) / A^(1/2), where the sign depends on the pairing. The coefficient a_P is around 34 MeV, but I need to verify. Wait, confusion arises here. Let me think again. The pairing term is δ = a_P * (even-odd factor) / A^(1/2). The even-odd factor is +1 for even-even, -1 for odd-odd, and 0 otherwise. The coefficient a_P is typically around 12 MeV. For example, if a_P is 12 MeV, then for even-even nuclei, you add 12/A^(1/2) MeV to the binding energy. But I've also seen values like 34 MeV for a_P. Wait, perhaps different conventions. Let me check standard values. According to common references, the coefficients are approximately:\n\na_V ≈ 15.5 MeV\n\na_S ≈ 16.8 MeV\n\na_C ≈ 0.72 MeV\n\na_A ≈ 23 MeV\n\na_P ≈ 34 MeV (but this might be for a different exponent, maybe A^(3/4)?)\n\nWait, no. Let me recall the formula properly. The pairing term is often written as δ = a_P * (even-odd factor) / A^(1/2). The coefficient a_P is around 12 MeV. For example, in some textbooks, the pairing term is given as ±12 MeV / A^(1/2). However, other sources might use a different exponent. Alternatively, the pairing term could be a_P / A^(3/4), but I think the standard formula uses A^(1/2). Let me confirm. The standard semiempirical mass formula (Bethe-Weizsäcker formula) has the pairing term as δ = a_P * (-1)^Z + (-1)^N / (2 * A^(1/2)), but perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, the pairing term is often simplified as +a_P/A^(1/2) for even-even, -a_P/A^(1/2) for odd-odd, and 0 otherwise. The coefficient a_P is around 12 MeV. However, different fits give different values. For example, some references give a_P as 34 MeV when the term is written as a_P/A^(3/4). Wait, maybe there's confusion between different formulations. Let me check.\n\nWait, the original formula from Bethe and Weizsäcker includes the pairing term as a term proportional to 1/A^(1/2). For example, the formula is:\n\nB(A,Z) = a_V*A - a_S*A^(2/3) - a_C*Z²/A^(1/3) - a_A*(A-2Z)²/(4A) + δ\n\nwhere δ = +a_P/A^(1/2) for even-even, -a_P/A^(1/2) for odd-odd, and 0 otherwise. The coefficient a_P is typically around 12 MeV. However, some sources might adjust this. For example, in the textbook \"Introductory Nuclear Physics\" by Krane, the coefficients are given as:\n\na_V = 15.5 MeV\n\na_S = 16.8 MeV\n\na_C = 0.72 MeV\n\na_A = 23 MeV\n\na_P = 34 MeV (but this is when the pairing term is written as ±a_P/A^(3/4))\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me check a specific source. According to the 2016 edition of Krane's \"Introductory Nuclear Physics\", the semiempirical mass formula is written as:\n\nB = a_V*A - a_S*A^{2/3} - a_C*Z²/A^{1/3} - a_A*(A-2Z)²/A + δ\n\nwhere δ = +a_P/A^{1/2} for even-even, -a_P/A^{1/2} for odd-odd, and 0 otherwise. The coefficients given are:\n\na_V = 15.5 MeV\n\na_S = 16.8 MeV\n\na_C = 0.72 MeV\n\na_A = 23 MeV\n\na_P = 12 MeV\n\nSo here, a_P is 12 MeV, and the pairing term is ±12/A^{1/2} MeV. However, other sources might present different coefficients based on more recent fits. For example, the 2003 review by Wapstra gives slightly different values. But for the purpose of this question, approximate values are acceptable.\n\nPutting it all together, the binding energy B(A,Z) is given by:\n\nB(A,Z) = a_V*A - a_S*A^{2/3} - a_C*(Z²/A^{1/3}) - a_A*(A-2Z)²/(4A) + δ\n\nWait, the asymmetry term is sometimes written as (N-Z)²/(4A) since N = A - Z, so (A - Z - Z)²/(4A) = (A - 2Z)²/(4A). Therefore, the term is a_A*(A-2Z)²/(4A). But in some formulations, the coefficient a_A is already adjusted to include the 4 in the denominator. For example, if the term is written as -a_A*(N - Z)²/A, then (N - Z) = A - 2Z, so (A - 2Z)²/A. If the coefficient a_A is 23 MeV, then that's equivalent to having (A-2Z)^2/(4A) multiplied by 23*4=92 MeV? Wait, no. Let me clarify. Suppose the term is written as -a_A*(N - Z)^2/A. Then substituting N = A - Z, we get (A - Z - Z)^2/A = (A - 2Z)^2/A. So the term is -a_A*(A - 2Z)^2/A. Alternatively, if the term is written as -a_A*(A - 2Z)^2/(4A), then the coefficient a_A would be four times smaller. For example, if the standard coefficient is 23 MeV for the term written as -(23 MeV)*(A - 2Z)^2/(4A), then that's equivalent to - (23/4)*(A-2Z)^2/A. But in Krane's book, the term is written as -a_A*(A - 2Z)^2/A, with a_A = 23 MeV. Wait, that can't be. Let me check Krane's book again. According to Krane, the asymmetry term is written as -a_A*(N - Z)^2/A. Since N = A - Z, this becomes -a_A*(A - 2Z)^2/A. The coefficient a_A is given as 23 MeV. So the term is -23*(A - 2Z)^2/A MeV. Therefore, the coefficient in front of (A - 2Z)^2/A is 23 MeV. So that's the asymmetry term.\n\nSo putting all together, the binding energy is:\n\nB = 15.5*A - 16.8*A^{2/3} - 0.72*Z²/A^{1/3} - 23*(A - 2Z)^2/A + δ\n\nwhere δ = +12/A^{1/2} for even-even, -12/A^{1/2} for odd-odd, 0 otherwise.\n\nBut wait, in some sources, the Coulomb term is written as a_C*Z(Z - 1)/A^{1/3} instead of a_C*Z²/A^{1/3}. For large Z, Z(Z - 1) ≈ Z², so the difference is negligible. But the exact formula might use Z(Z - 1) to account for the proton pairs. However, in many simplified versions, it's approximated as Z². The coefficient a_C would then be adjusted accordingly. For example, if using Z², a_C is approximately 0.72 MeV, but if using Z(Z-1), the coefficient might be slightly different. But for the purposes of this explanation, using Z² and a_C ≈ 0.72 MeV is acceptable.\n\nNow, each term in the formula corresponds to a different physical effect:\n\n1. Volume term (a_V*A): This is the dominant term, arising from the strong nuclear force between nucleons. Each nucleon contributes equally, leading to a term proportional to A. The coefficient a_V ≈ 15.5 MeV represents the binding energy per nucleon due to the volume effect, assuming uniform density.\n\n2. Surface term (-a_S*A^{2/3}): Nucleons at the surface have fewer neighbors, reducing the binding energy. The term is proportional to the surface area, hence A^{2/3}. The coefficient a_S ≈ 16.8 MeV corrects the overestimation of the volume term by accounting for surface effects.\n\n3. Coulomb term (-a_C*Z²/A^{1/3}): The electrostatic repulsion between protons reduces binding energy. The term is proportional to the number of proton pairs (≈Z²) and inversely proportional to the nuclear radius (≈A^{1/3}), leading to Z²/A^{1/3}. The coefficient a_C ≈ 0.72 MeV accounts for the Coulomb energy per proton pair.\n\n4. Asymmetry term (-a_A*(A - 2Z)^2/A): A result of the Pauli exclusion principle, which favors N ≈ Z. When there's an imbalance (N ≠ Z), the kinetic energy increases, reducing binding energy. The term is proportional to (N - Z)^2/A, with a coefficient a_A ≈ 23 MeV.\n\n5. Pairing term (±a_P/A^{1/2}): Even numbers of protons and neutrons lead to greater stability. The term δ is positive for even-even nuclei, negative for odd-odd, and zero otherwise. The coefficient a_P ≈ 12 MeV, and the term decreases with A as 1/A^{1/2}.\n\nThese coefficients are determined by fitting the formula to experimental nuclear masses. The values can vary slightly depending on the dataset and fitting method, but the approximate magnitudes are as stated.\n\nSo, summarizing each term with their coefficients:\n\n- Volume term: +15.5*A MeV\n\n- Surface term: -16.8*A^{2/3} MeV\n\n- Coulomb term: -0.72*Z²/A^{1/3} MeV\n\n- Asymmetry term: -23*(A - 2Z)^2/A MeV\n\n- Pairing term: ±12/A^{1/2} MeV (depending on even-odd)\n\nThe total binding energy B(A,Z) is the sum of these terms. The nuclear mass is then calculated by subtracting the binding energy (divided by c²) from the sum of the individual proton and neutron masses.\n\nI should also mention that the mass formula is more accurate for heavier nuclei and has limitations, especially for light nuclei where shell effects are significant. But the question asks to explain and justify each term with approximate coefficients, which I think I've covered.\n</think>\n\nThe semiempirical mass formula (Bethe-Weizsäcker formula) calculates the binding energy \\( B(A, Z) \\) of a nucleus, which determines its mass. The formula incorporates five terms reflecting distinct physical effects, each with empirically determined coefficients:\n\n1. **Volume Term (\\( +a_V A \\))**  \n   Represents the binding energy from the strong nuclear force, proportional to the number of nucleons \\( A \\). Nucleons in the interior contribute uniformly.  \n   **Coefficient**: \\( a_V \\approx 15.5 \\, \\text{MeV} \\).\n\n2. **Surface Term (\\( -a_S A^{2/3} \\))**  \n   Corrects for nucleons on the surface, which have fewer neighbors and contribute less binding energy. Proportional to the surface area (\\( \\propto A^{2/3} \\)).  \n   **Coefficient**: \\( a_S \\approx 16.8 \\, \\text{MeV} \\).\n\n3. **Coulomb Term (\\( -a_C \\frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}} \\))**  \n   Accounts for electrostatic repulsion between protons. Energy scales with \\( Z^2 \\) (proton pairs) and inversely with nuclear radius (\\( \\propto A^{1/3} \\)).  \n   **Coefficient**: \\( a_C \\approx 0.72 \\, \\text{MeV} \\).\n\n4. **Asymmetry Term (\\( -a_A \\frac{(A - 2Z)^2}{A} \\))**  \n   Penalizes imbalance between neutrons (\\( N = A - Z \\)) and protons due to the Pauli exclusion principle. Energy increases with \\( (N - Z)^2 \\), normalized by \\( A \\).  \n   **Coefficient**: \\( a_A \\approx 23 \\, \\text{MeV} \\).\n\n5. **Pairing Term (\\( \\pm \\frac{a_P}{A^{1/2}} \\))**  \n   Stabilizes nuclei with even numbers of protons and neutrons (even-even: \\( + \\)), destabilizes odd-odd nuclei (\\( - \\)), and has no effect for odd-\\( A \\).  \n   **Coefficient**: \\( a_P \\approx 12 \\, \\text{MeV} \\).\n\nThe total binding energy is:  \n\\[\nB(A, Z) = a_V A - a_S A^{2/3} - a_C \\frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}} - a_A \\frac{(A - 2Z)^2}{A} + \\delta,\n\\]  \nwhere \\( \\delta = \\pm \\frac{a_P}{A^{1/2}} \\).

{"id": "atomic/4-6", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these two physics problems. Starting with part (a). So, a neutron is 5000 light-years away from Earth, and its half-life is 13 minutes. We need to find out how much energy it must have to reach Earth before decaying. Hmm, right. Since the neutron is moving at a relativistic speed, time dilation will affect its half-life from our perspective on Earth. The idea is that the neutron's lifetime will be extended due to its high velocity, allowing it to travel the distance within that dilated time.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the half-life in the lab frame (Earth's frame) is the proper half-life multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma. The proper half-life is given as 13 minutes, which is the half-life in the neutron's rest frame. So, the observed half-life t is gamma multiplied by t0, where t0 is 13 minutes.\n\nThe neutron needs to travel 5000 light-years in the lab frame within this time t. The distance is 5000 light-years, so the time it takes to reach Earth (from our perspective) must be less than or equal to the dilated half-life. Wait, but actually, the problem states \"at the end of one half life,\" so the time taken should be exactly one half-life in our frame. So, the time t is equal to the dilated half-life, which is gamma * t0. But wait, the time taken to travel the distance is distance divided by speed. So, t = d / v. But t is also gamma * t0. Therefore, gamma * t0 = d / v. We need to solve for v, and then find the energy, which would be (gamma - 1) * rest mass energy, since kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc².\n\nBut let's write down the equations step by step.\n\nGiven:\n- Distance d = 5000 light-years. But we need to convert this into a unit compatible with time. Since 1 light-year is the distance light travels in one year. So, 5000 light-years is the distance, so the time light would take is 5000 years. But the neutron's half-life is 13 minutes. So, the neutron must be moving very fast to cover 5000 light-years in a time that's on the order of 13 minutes (dilated). So, converting 5000 light-years to light-minutes? Wait, maybe better to convert everything into consistent units. Let's convert the distance into meters and the time into seconds.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. Let's use natural units where c=1. Then distance can be expressed in terms of time. So, 5000 light-years is 5000 years multiplied by the speed of light. So, in time units, the distance is 5000 years. So, the time taken by the neutron to reach Earth is t = 5000 years / v, where v is in units of c. But the neutron's half-life in our frame is gamma * t0, where t0 is 13 minutes. So, setting gamma * t0 = t = 5000 years / v.\n\nBut let's convert 5000 years into minutes to have the same time unit as t0. There are 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, 365 days in a year. So, minutes in a year: 60 * 24 * 365 = 525600 minutes per year. So, 5000 years is 5000 * 525600 minutes. Let me compute that:\n\n5000 * 525,600 = 5 * 10^3 * 5.256 * 10^5 = 2.628 * 10^9 minutes.\n\nSo, t = 2.628 * 10^9 minutes. But the half-life in our frame is gamma * 13 minutes. So, gamma * 13 = 2.628e9 / v. Wait, but v is in terms of c. Since we're using natural units where c=1, v is a fraction of c. So, the time t is equal to d / v, where d is in light-minutes? Wait, maybe I confused units here.\n\nWait, if the distance is 5000 light-years, then in terms of light-minutes, 1 light-year is the distance light travels in one year. So, 1 year is 365 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 525,600 minutes. So, 1 light-year is 1 light-minute * 525,600. Therefore, 5000 light-years is 5000 * 525,600 light-minutes. So, the distance in light-minutes is 5000 * 525,600. Then, the time taken for the neutron to reach Earth is (distance in light-minutes) / v, where v is in units of c. So, time t = (5000 * 525,600 light-minutes) / v. But since v is in units of c, this time is in minutes. So, t = (5000 * 525,600) / v minutes.\n\nBut this time must equal the dilated half-life, which is gamma * t0, where t0 is 13 minutes. Therefore:\n\ngamma * 13 = (5000 * 525,600) / v\n\nBut gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2). So, substituting gamma:\n\n(1 / sqrt(1 - v^2)) * 13 = (5000 * 525,600) / v\n\nWe can solve for v here. Let's compute the right-hand side:\n\n5000 * 525,600 = 5000 * 525,600 = 2,628,000,000. So, 2.628e9.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n13 / sqrt(1 - v^2) = 2.628e9 / v\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(1 - v^2):\n\n13 = (2.628e9 / v) * sqrt(1 - v^2)\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n13^2 = (2.628e9)^2 / v^2 * (1 - v^2)\n\n169 = (6.908e18) / v^2 * (1 - v^2)\n\nMultiply both sides by v^2:\n\n169 v^2 = 6.908e18 (1 - v^2)\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n169 v^2 + 6.908e18 v^2 = 6.908e18\n\nv^2 (169 + 6.908e18) = 6.908e18\n\nBut 6.908e18 is way larger than 169, so we can approximate:\n\nv^2 ≈ 6.908e18 / 6.908e18 = 1. So, v ≈ 1. But this seems like the neutron must be moving at nearly the speed of light. However, let's check the approximation. Since 169 is negligible compared to 6.908e18, we can ignore it. Therefore, v ≈ sqrt(6.908e18 / 6.908e18) = 1. But this is an approximation. However, perhaps we need to be more precise.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check the equation again. Let's re-express the equation:\n\nFrom 13 / sqrt(1 - v²) = (2.628e9) / v\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\n13 v = 2.628e9 sqrt(1 - v²)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(13 v)^2 = (2.628e9)^2 (1 - v²)\n\n169 v² = 6.908e18 (1 - v²)\n\n169 v² + 6.908e18 v² = 6.908e18\n\nv² (169 + 6.908e18) = 6.908e18\n\nv² = 6.908e18 / (6.908e18 + 169) ≈ 6.908e18 / 6.908e18 = 1 - (169 / 6.908e18)\n\nSo, v² ≈ 1 - 169 / 6.908e18\n\nTherefore, v ≈ sqrt(1 - 169 / 6.908e18) ≈ 1 - (169)/(2 * 6.908e18) using the binomial approximation for sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 when x is small.\n\nSo, v ≈ 1 - (169)/(1.3816e19) ≈ 1 - 1.223e-17. So, v is extremely close to c. Therefore, gamma is approximately 2.628e9 / (13 v). Since v ≈ 1, gamma ≈ 2.628e9 / 13 ≈ 2.628e9 / 13 ≈ 202,153,846.15.\n\nWait, gamma is approximately 2.628e9 / 13 ≈ 202 million. Then, the energy of the neutron is gamma * m c². But the rest mass is 940 MeV. So, the total energy is gamma * 940 MeV. The kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * 940 MeV. Since gamma is so large, the kinetic energy is approximately gamma * 940 MeV. But let's compute it properly.\n\nBut wait, gamma is 2.628e9 / 13 ≈ 202,153,846. So, gamma ≈ 2.0215e8. Wait, wait, 2.628e9 divided by 13 is 2.628e9 / 13 ≈ 202,153,846.15. So, gamma ≈ 2.0215e8. Therefore, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * 940 ≈ gamma * 940 ≈ 2.0215e8 * 940 ≈ 1.899e11 MeV. That's 1.899e11 MeV, which is 1.899e5 GeV, or 189.9 TeV. But that seems extremely high. Wait, but given that the neutron has to travel 5000 light-years in 13 minutes (dilated), it's moving at a speed extremely close to c, so gamma is enormous, leading to a huge energy. So, the answer is approximately 1.9e11 MeV, but let's check the exact calculation.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a mistake in the calculation. Let's redo the gamma calculation. From the equation:\n\ngamma = (d) / (v * t0 * c)\n\nBut since we're using natural units where c=1, but perhaps better to write in terms of units. Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's use the relation between velocity, distance, and time. The time experienced by the neutron is proper time tau = t0 (half-life). The time in Earth's frame is t = gamma tau. The distance is d = v t = v gamma tau. Therefore, d = v gamma tau. Solving for gamma:\n\ngamma = d / (v tau)\n\nBut tau is 13 minutes. So, gamma = d / (v tau). But gamma is also 1 / sqrt(1 - v²). So,\n\n1 / sqrt(1 - v²) = d / (v tau)\n\nMultiply both sides by sqrt(1 - v²):\n\n1 = d / (v tau) * sqrt(1 - v²)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n1 = (d²)/(v² tau²) (1 - v²)\n\nMultiply both sides by v² tau²:\n\nv² tau² = d² (1 - v²)\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nv² tau² + d² v² = d²\n\nv² (tau² + d²) = d²\n\nv² = d² / (tau² + d²)\n\nTherefore, v = d / sqrt(tau² + d²)\n\nBut tau is 13 minutes, d is 5000 light-years. Let's convert both to the same units. Let's convert d into light-minutes. 1 light-year is 1 year * c. 1 year is 525,600 minutes. So, 5000 light-years is 5000 * 525,600 light-minutes. So, d = 5000 * 525,600 light-minutes. Tau is 13 minutes. So,\n\nv = (5000 * 525,600) / sqrt(13² + (5000 * 525,600)^2 )\n\nBut since (5000 * 525,600) is much larger than 13, the denominator is approximately (5000 * 525,600). Therefore, v ≈ (5000 * 525,600) / (5000 * 525,600) ) = 1. So, v ≈ 1. Therefore, gamma is approximately d / (v tau) ≈ (5000 * 525,600) / (1 * 13) ≈ (5000 * 525,600) / 13. Let's compute that:\n\n5000 * 525,600 = 2,628,000,000. Divided by 13: 2,628,000,000 / 13 ≈ 202,153,846.15. So, gamma ≈ 2.02e8. Therefore, the energy is gamma * m c². The rest mass is 940 MeV, so total energy is 2.02e8 * 940 MeV ≈ 1.9e11 MeV. So, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)*940 ≈ gamma * 940, which is approximately 1.9e11 MeV. So, the answer is approximately 1.9e11 MeV. But let's check if the exact calculation gives a slightly different value. However, given the approximation, this is the result.\n\nSo, part (a) answer is approximately 1.9e11 MeV. But let's write it in proper scientific notation. 1.9e11 MeV is 1.9 × 10^11 MeV. But maybe the problem expects an exact expression. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, another approach: using the relation between velocity, gamma, and distance. The time in Earth's frame is t = d / v. The proper time experienced by the neutron is tau = t / gamma. But tau must be equal to the half-life, 13 minutes. So, tau = t / gamma = (d / v) / gamma = d / (v gamma). But tau = 13 minutes. Therefore, d / (v gamma) = 13. But gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²). So,\n\nd / (v / sqrt(1 - v²)) ) = 13\n\n=> d * sqrt(1 - v²) / v = 13\n\n=> sqrt(1 - v²) = 13 v / d\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n1 - v² = (169 v²) / d²\n\nMultiply both sides by d²:\n\nd² (1 - v²) = 169 v²\n\nd² - d² v² = 169 v²\n\nd² = v² (d² + 169)\n\nTherefore,\n\nv² = d² / (d² + 169)\n\nSo,\n\nv = d / sqrt(d² + 169)\n\nBut d is 5000 light-years converted into light-minutes. As before, d = 5000 * 525,600 light-minutes. Let's compute d:\n\nd = 5000 * 525,600 = 2,628,000,000 light-minutes.\n\nSo,\n\nv = 2,628,000,000 / sqrt( (2,628,000,000)^2 + 13^2 )\n\nBut since 2,628,000,000^2 is much larger than 13^2, sqrt(d² + 169) ≈ d + (169)/(2d). So,\n\nv ≈ d / (d + 169/(2d)) ) ≈ 1 / (1 + 169/(2d²)) ≈ 1 - 169/(2d²)\n\nBut since d is 2.628e9 light-minutes, d² is (2.628e9)^2 ≈ 6.9e18. So,\n\nv ≈ 1 - 169/(2 * 6.9e18) ≈ 1 - 1.22e-17. So, v is practically 1. Therefore, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²) ≈ d / 13 ≈ 2.628e9 / 13 ≈ 2.0215e8. So, gamma is approximately 2.0215e8. Therefore, the total energy is gamma * m c² = 2.0215e8 * 940 MeV ≈ 1.9e11 MeV. So, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * 940 ≈ gamma * 940 ≈ 1.9e11 MeV. So, the answer is approximately 1.9 × 10^11 MeV. But let's write it as 1.9e11 MeV or in proper notation. However, the problem might expect an exact expression. Wait, but given the numbers, it's better to compute the exact gamma.\n\nAlternatively, since gamma ≈ d / (c tau), where d is 5000 light-years, c tau is the distance light travels in tau time. Tau is 13 minutes, so c tau is 13 light-minutes. Therefore, gamma ≈ d / (c tau) = (5000 light-years) / (13 light-minutes). Convert 5000 light-years to light-minutes: 5000 * 525,600 = 2.628e9 light-minutes. So, gamma ≈ 2.628e9 / 13 ≈ 2.0215e8. So, same as before. Therefore, energy is gamma * 940 MeV ≈ 2.0215e8 * 940 ≈ 1.899e11 MeV. So, approximately 1.9e11 MeV. So, the answer is 1.9 × 10^11 MeV. But let's check the exact multiplication:\n\n2.0215e8 * 940 = 2.0215e8 * 9.4e2 = 2.0215 * 9.4 * 1e10 = (2.0215 * 9.4) * 1e10. 2.0215 * 9.4 ≈ 19.0. So, 19.0 * 1e10 = 1.9e11 MeV. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, part (a) answer is approximately 1.9 × 10^11 MeV. But the problem might want it in a different unit, but since the rest mass is given in MeV, the answer should be in MeV. So, boxed as \\boxed{1.9 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ MeV}}.\n\nNow, moving to part (b). The decay is π+ → μ+ + ν_μ. The μ+ has a kinetic energy of 4.0 MeV, rest mass 106 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is zero. We need to find the rest mass of the π+.\n\nIn the decay, the pion is at rest, so the total momentum of the muon and neutrino must be zero. Therefore, their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Let's denote the magnitude of the momentum of the muon as p, and the neutrino's momentum is also p (since it's massless, its energy is p c, but in natural units c=1, so energy is p).\n\nThe total energy of the system is the rest mass of the pion, which must equal the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino. So,\n\nm_π c² = E_μ + E_ν\n\nBut since the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So, |p_μ| = |p_ν|. The neutrino is massless, so E_ν = |p_ν| c = |p_μ| c. In natural units (c=1), E_ν = |p_μ|.\n\nThe muon's energy is its rest mass energy plus kinetic energy: E_μ = m_μ c² + K_μ. Given K_μ = 4.0 MeV, and m_μ = 106 MeV, so E_μ = 106 + 4 = 110 MeV.\n\nBut also, the muon's energy can be expressed in terms of its momentum. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is E_μ² = (m_μ c²)² + (p_μ c)^2. Again, in natural units (c=1), E_μ² = m_μ² + p_μ². Therefore, p_μ = sqrt(E_μ² - m_μ²). Plugging in E_μ = 110 MeV, m_μ = 106 MeV:\n\np_μ = sqrt(110² - 106²) = sqrt( (110 - 106)(110 + 106) ) = sqrt(4 * 216) = sqrt(864) = 12*sqrt(6) ≈ 29.3936 MeV.\n\nBut since the neutrino's momentum is equal in magnitude, E_ν = p_ν = p_μ ≈ 29.3936 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the total energy is E_μ + E_ν = 110 + 29.3936 ≈ 139.3936 MeV. Therefore, the rest mass of the pion is approximately 139.4 MeV. But let's compute it more precisely.\n\nLet's do exact calculation:\n\nE_μ = 110 MeV\n\np_μ = sqrt(110² - 106²) = sqrt(12100 - 11236) = sqrt(864) = 12*sqrt(6) MeV. So, exact value is 12√6 MeV.\n\nE_ν = p_ν = p_μ = 12√6 MeV.\n\nTherefore, total energy m_π = 110 + 12√6 MeV.\n\nCompute 12√6: √6 ≈ 2.4495, so 12*2.4495 ≈ 29.394 MeV. So, total m_π ≈ 110 + 29.394 ≈ 139.394 MeV. So, approximately 139.4 MeV. But let's compute it symbolically.\n\nAlternatively, since m_π = E_μ + E_ν = E_μ + p_μ. And E_μ = m_μ + K_μ = 106 + 4 = 110 MeV. Then, p_μ = sqrt(E_μ² - m_μ²) = sqrt(110² - 106²) = sqrt( (110 - 106)(110 + 106) ) = sqrt(4 * 216) = sqrt(864) = 12√6. So, m_π = 110 + 12√6. Let's compute this exactly:\n\n12√6 ≈ 12 * 2.449489743 ≈ 29.39387691. So, 110 + 29.39387691 ≈ 139.39387691 MeV. Rounding to appropriate significant figures. The given kinetic energy is 4.0 MeV (two significant figures), and the rest mass of muon is 106 MeV (three significant figures). So, the answer should have three significant figures. 139.393... ≈ 139.4 MeV. So, the rest mass of the pion is approximately 139.4 MeV. But let's check if there's a more precise way.\n\nAlternatively, using exact values:\n\nm_π = E_μ + p_μ\n\nBut E_μ = 110 MeV, p_μ = sqrt(110² - 106²) = sqrt(12100 - 11236) = sqrt(864) = 12√6.\n\nSo, m_π = 110 + 12√6. If we compute this exactly, 12√6 is irrational, but perhaps the problem expects an exact expression. However, given the numbers, it's likely that the answer is approximately 139.4 MeV. But let's check if there's a mistake in the reasoning.\n\nWait, another approach: conservation of energy and momentum. The pion is at rest, so the total momentum of the decay products must be zero. Therefore, the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta. Let p be the magnitude of the muon's momentum, then the neutrino's momentum is also p (since it's massless, its energy is p). The muon's energy is sqrt(p² + m_μ²). The total energy is sqrt(p² + m_μ²) + p = m_π.\n\nBut the muon's kinetic energy is K = sqrt(p² + m_μ²) - m_μ = 4.0 MeV. So,\n\nsqrt(p² + m_μ²) = m_μ + K = 106 + 4 = 110 MeV.\n\nTherefore, p = sqrt( (110)^2 - (106)^2 ) = sqrt(12100 - 11236) = sqrt(864) = 12√6 MeV.\n\nThen, the total energy m_π = 110 + p = 110 + 12√6 ≈ 110 + 29.393 ≈ 139.393 MeV. So, approximately 139.4 MeV. Therefore, the rest mass of the pion is approximately 139.4 MeV. So, the answer is \\boxed{139.4 \\text{ MeV}}.\n\nBut let me check if there's a different approach. For example, using conservation of four-momentum. The pion's four-momentum is (m_π, 0). The muon and neutrino's four-momenta add up to this. The muon's four-momentum is (E_μ, p_μ), and the neutrino's is (p_ν, -p_μ) since their spatial momenta are opposite. Since the neutrino is massless, E_ν = p_ν. So, total energy is E_μ + p_ν = m_π, and total momentum is p_μ - p_ν = 0 => p_μ = p_ν. Therefore, p_ν = p_μ. So, E_ν = p_μ. Then, E_μ = sqrt(p_μ² + m_μ²). The kinetic energy K = E_μ - m_μ = 4.0 MeV. So, E_μ = m_μ + K = 110 MeV. Then, p_μ = sqrt(E_μ² - m_μ²) = sqrt(110² - 106²) = 12√6 MeV. Then, m_π = E_μ + p_μ = 110 + 12√6 ≈ 139.4 MeV. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 139.4 MeV.\n</think>\n\n(a) To determine the energy required for the neutron to reach Earth within one half-life, we consider relativistic time dilation. The neutron's half-life in Earth's frame is dilated by the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\). The neutron must travel 5000 light-years (converted to light-minutes) in this dilated time. Solving for \\( \\gamma \\) and using the rest mass energy of the neutron, we find:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma \\approx \\frac{5000 \\times 525600}{13} \\approx 2.02 \\times 10^8\n\\]\n\nThe total energy is \\( \\gamma \\times 940 \\, \\text{MeV} \\), resulting in:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.9 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{MeV}}\n\\]\n\n(b) For the decay \\( \\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu_\\mu \\), conservation of energy and momentum requires the pion's rest mass to equal the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy.

{"id": "atomic/2-47", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve part (a) of this neutron star problem. Let me start by recalling what I know about neutron stars and degenerate Fermi gases. \n\nThe problem says that a neutron star is approximated as a sphere of neutrons forming a nonrelativistic degenerate Fermi gas. The pressure from this gas balances the gravitational attraction to keep the star stable. The mass given is 10^33 grams, which is 10^30 kg since 1e3 g = 1 kg. Wait, no, 10^33 grams is 10^30 kg? Wait, 1 kg is 10^3 grams, so 10^33 grams is 10^33 / 10^3 = 10^30 kg. But actually, 10^33 grams is 10^30 kg? Wait, 1e3 grams = 1 kg, so 1e33 grams is 1e33 / 1e3 = 1e30 kg. Yes, that's right. So the mass M is 1e30 kg. Wait, but the mass of the Sun is about 2e30 kg, so this neutron star is about half a solar mass? Hmm, maybe. But maybe the actual number isn't too important right now.\n\nThe goal is to estimate the radius of the neutron star to within an order of magnitude. So even if my calculation is off by a factor of 10, that's okay. But I need to derive it using some physics principles.\n\nFirst, let's think about the balance between the Fermi gas pressure and gravitational contraction. For a degenerate Fermi gas, the pressure arises from the Pauli exclusion principle, which prevents neutrons from occupying the same quantum state. In the nonrelativistic case, the Fermi pressure depends on the density in a certain way. \n\nThe key equations here would relate the Fermi energy to the density, then use that to find the pressure, and set that equal to the gravitational pressure.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the Fermi momentum in a nonrelativistic gas. The Fermi momentum p_F is given by (h/(2π)) * (3π² n)^(1/3), where n is the number density. Then the Fermi energy is p_F²/(2m), where m is the neutron mass.\n\nThe pressure of a nonrelativistic degenerate gas is roughly P ≈ (n * p_F²)/(2m) * something. Wait, actually, the pressure for a nonrelativistic Fermi gas is (3/5) n E_F, where E_F is the Fermi energy. Wait, let me check. For a Fermi gas at zero temperature, the pressure can be calculated using the equation of state. For nonrelativistic fermions, the pressure is P = ( (3π²)^(2/3) / 5 ) * (ħ²/m) * n^(5/3). So maybe that's the formula. Let me confirm. \n\nYes, the pressure for a nonrelativistic degenerate Fermi gas is P = ( (3π²)^(2/3) * ħ² )/(5 m) * (n)^(5/3). So that's the expression. Here, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the neutron mass, and n is the number density.\n\nOn the gravitational side, the gravitational pressure can be estimated using the virial theorem. For a star in hydrostatic equilibrium, the gravitational potential energy must balance the internal kinetic energy. The gravitational potential energy for a sphere of uniform density is U_grav ≈ - (3/5) G M² / R. The kinetic energy for the Fermi gas would be related to the Fermi energy. But maybe instead of energy, I can equate the pressures.\n\nAlternatively, using the virial theorem: 3 P V ≈ -U_grav / 2. Wait, the virial theorem states that the average kinetic energy (which relates to pressure) is half the gravitational potential energy. So maybe 3 P V ≈ (3/10) G M² / R. Hmm, but I need to be careful here. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the condition for hydrostatic equilibrium is that the pressure gradient supports the gravitational force. For a rough estimate, we can equate the Fermi pressure to the gravitational pressure. The gravitational pressure at the center of the star can be approximated as P_grav ≈ G M² / R^4. Wait, how is that derived? Let me think. The gravitational force per unit area would be something like (G M ρ)/R^2, where ρ is the density. Then pressure is force per area, so integrating over radius... Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, dimensional analysis. The gravitational pressure should depend on G, M, R. Let's see: G has units of m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}. So to get pressure (kg m^{-1} s^{-2}), we need to combine G, M, R. Let's see: P ~ G M^2 / R^4. Because G M^2 / R^4 has units (m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}) * kg^2 / m^4 = kg m^{-1} s^{-2}, which is pressure. So maybe P_grav ~ G M² / R^4. Then setting Fermi pressure equal to this.\n\nSo equate the Fermi pressure P_Fermi = ( (3π²)^(2/3) ħ² )/(5 m) * (n)^(5/3) to P_grav ~ G M² / R^4.\n\nBut n is the number density of neutrons. Since the star is made of neutrons, the number density n = (M / m) / ( (4/3) π R^3 ). Because total number of neutrons is M/m, where m is the neutron mass. So n = 3 M/(4 π R^3 m).\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for P_Fermi:\n\nP_Fermi = ( (3π²)^(2/3) ħ² )/(5 m) * [ 3 M/(4 π R^3 m) ]^(5/3 )\n\nSimplify this expression. Let's compute the constants first. Let's compute (3π²)^(2/3) * (3/(4π))^(5/3). Let's see:\n\nFirst, (3π²)^(2/3) = 3^(2/3) π^(4/3)\n\nThen, (3/(4π))^(5/3) = 3^(5/3) / (4^(5/3) π^(5/3))\n\nMultiplying these together: 3^(2/3 + 5/3) π^(4/3 -5/3) / 4^(5/3) = 3^(7/3) π^(-1/3) / 4^(5/3)\n\nSo the constants in front become (3^(7/3) π^(-1/3) / 4^(5/3)) * ħ²/(5 m) * (M/(R^3 m))^(5/3)\n\nWait, but the original expression is:\n\n( (3π²)^(2/3) ħ² )/(5 m) * [ 3 M/(4 π R^3 m) ]^(5/3 )\n\nSo let's factor out all the constants. Let me compute:\n\n(3π²)^(2/3) * [3/(4π)]^(5/3) = 3^(2/3) π^(4/3) * 3^(5/3) / (4^(5/3) π^(5/3)) ) = 3^(7/3) / (4^(5/3)) * π^(4/3 -5/3) ) = 3^(7/3) / (4^(5/3)) * π^(-1/3)\n\nSo that's the constant factor. Then, the rest is:\n\nħ²/(5 m) * (M/(R^3 m))^(5/3 )\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nP_Fermi = [3^(7/3) / (4^(5/3) 5) ) * π^(-1/3) ) ] * ħ²/(m) * (M/(R^3 m))^(5/3 )\n\nBut maybe instead of getting bogged down in constants, since the problem allows for rough estimates and order of magnitude, we can approximate the numerical factors. Let's see:\n\n3^(7/3) is approximately 3^2 * 3^(1/3) ≈ 9 * 1.44 ≈ 12.96\n\n4^(5/3) is (4^(1/3))^5 ≈ (1.587)^5 ≈ 1.587 * 1.587=2.52, *1.587≈4.0, *1.587≈6.35, *1.587≈10.08. So 4^(5/3) ≈ 10.08\n\nπ^(-1/3) ≈ 1 / (2.08) ≈ 0.48\n\nSo the constant factor is approximately (12.96) / (10.08 * 5) * 0.48 ≈ (12.96 / 50.4) * 0.48 ≈ (0.257) * 0.48 ≈ 0.123\n\nSo approximately, P_Fermi ≈ 0.123 * ħ²/m * (M/(R^3 m))^(5/3 )\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\n(M/(R^3 m))^(5/3) = M^(5/3) / (R^5 m^(5/3))\n\nSo P_Fermi ≈ 0.123 * ħ²/m * M^(5/3) / (R^5 m^(5/3)) )\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= 0.123 * ħ² M^(5/3) / ( R^5 m^(8/3) )\n\nSo P_Fermi ≈ 0.123 ħ² M^(5/3) / ( R^5 m^(8/3) )\n\nNow, equate this to the gravitational pressure P_grav ~ G M² / R^4\n\nSo:\n\n0.123 ħ² M^(5/3) / ( R^5 m^(8/3) ) ≈ G M² / R^4\n\nMultiply both sides by R^5:\n\n0.123 ħ² M^(5/3) / m^(8/3) ≈ G M² R\n\nSolve for R:\n\nR ≈ 0.123 ħ² M^(5/3) / ( G M² m^(8/3) )\n\nSimplify exponents:\n\nM^(5/3) / M² = M^(5/3 - 6/3) = M^(-1/3) = 1 / M^(1/3)\n\nSo:\n\nR ≈ 0.123 ħ² / ( G M^(1/3) m^(8/3) )\n\nCombine the constants:\n\n0.123 is approximately 0.1, but maybe we can keep it as 0.1 for simplicity. So:\n\nR ≈ (0.1 ħ² ) / ( G M^(1/3) m^(8/3) )\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. Let's compute each term:\n\nFirst, constants:\n\nħ (reduced Planck constant) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s\n\nG = 6.6743e-11 m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}\n\nM = 1e30 kg\n\nm (neutron mass) ≈ 1.67492749804e-27 kg\n\nCompute M^(1/3): (1e30 kg)^(1/3) = 1e10 kg^(1/3). Wait, but units here? Wait, M is in kg, so M^(1/3) is kg^(1/3). Similarly, m^(8/3) is (kg)^(8/3). Let's see:\n\nSo the denominator is G * M^(1/3) * m^(8/3)\n\nLet me compute the denominator first:\n\nG = 6.6743e-11 m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}\n\nM^(1/3) = (1e30 kg)^(1/3) = 1e10 kg^(1/3)\n\nm^(8/3) = (1.6749e-27 kg)^(8/3) ≈ (1.6749e-27)^(8/3) kg^(8/3)\n\nCompute (1.6749e-27)^(8/3):\n\nFirst, take the cube root: (1.6749e-27)^(1/3) ≈ 1.19e-9\n\nThen raise to the 8th power: (1.19e-9)^8 ≈ (1.19)^8 * 10^{-72} ≈ 4.3 * 10^{-72}\n\nSo m^(8/3) ≈ 4.3e-72 kg^(8/3)\n\nSo denominator:\n\nG * M^(1/3) * m^(8/3) ≈ 6.6743e-11 * 1e10 * 4.3e-72\n\nMultiply 6.6743e-11 * 1e10 = 6.6743e-1\n\nThen 6.6743e-1 * 4.3e-72 ≈ 2.87e-72\n\nSo denominator ≈ 2.87e-72 m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2} * kg^(1/3) * kg^(8/3) ) = 2.87e-72 m^3 s^{-2} kg^{-1 + 1/3 + 8/3} )\n\nWait, the units: kg^{-1} * kg^{1/3} * kg^{8/3} = kg^{-1 + 1/3 + 8/3} = kg^{-1 + 3} = kg^{2}\n\nSo denominator units: m^3 s^{-2} kg^{2}\n\nNow numerator: 0.1 * ħ²\n\nħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s = 1.0545718e-34 kg m^2/s\n\nSo ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 kg^2 m^4 / s^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 kg^2 m^4 / s^2\n\nMultiply by 0.1: 1.112e-69 kg^2 m^4 / s^2\n\nSo numerator ≈ 1.112e-69 kg^2 m^4 / s^2\n\nSo R ≈ numerator / denominator = (1.112e-69 kg^2 m^4 / s^2 ) / (2.87e-72 m^3 s^{-2} kg^{2}) )\n\nSimplify units:\n\nkg^2 / kg^2 = 1\n\nm^4 / m^3 = m\n\ns^{-2} / s^{-2} = 1\n\nSo units are meters.\n\nNumerically:\n\n1.112e-69 / 2.87e-72 = (1.112 / 2.87) * 10^{3} ≈ 0.387 * 1e3 ≈ 387\n\nSo R ≈ 387 meters? Wait, that seems way too small. Neutron stars are typically about 10 kilometers in radius. So 387 meters is three orders of magnitude smaller. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, let's check the exponents again. The denominator was 2.87e-72, numerator 1.112e-69. So 1.112e-69 / 2.87e-72 = (1.112 / 2.87) * 1e3 ≈ 0.387 * 1e3 ≈ 387. So 387 meters. But neutron stars are ~10 km, which is 1e4 meters. So this is off by a factor of ~25. Hmm. Maybe the approximation in the constants was too rough. Remember, earlier I approximated the numerical factor as 0.123, then 0.1, but maybe that's where the error is. Let's redo the constant factor more accurately.\n\nOriginal expression for P_Fermi:\n\nP_Fermi = [ (3π²)^(2/3) * (3/(4π))^(5/3) / 5 ] * ħ²/(m) * (M/(R^3 m))^(5/3 )\n\nLet me compute the constant factor more precisely.\n\nFirst, compute (3π²)^(2/3):\n\nTake ln(3π²) = ln(3) + 2 ln(π) ≈ 1.0986 + 2*1.1442 ≈ 1.0986 + 2.2884 ≈ 3.387\n\nMultiply by 2/3: 3.387 * 2/3 ≈ 2.258\n\nExponentiate: e^(2.258) ≈ 9.57\n\nWait, but (3π²) ≈ 3*(9.8696) ≈ 29.609, so (29.609)^(2/3). Let's compute 29.609^(1/3) first. 3^3=27, 4^3=64, so cube root of 29.6 is ~3.08. Then square that: ~9.48. So (3π²)^(2/3) ≈ 9.48.\n\nThen (3/(4π))^(5/3):\n\n3/(4π) ≈ 3/(12.566) ≈ 0.2387\n\nTake the 5/3 power: (0.2387)^(5/3). First, cube root of 0.2387 ≈ 0.62, then raise to 5th power: 0.62^5 ≈ 0.62*0.62=0.3844, *0.62≈0.238, *0.62≈0.1476, *0.62≈0.0915. So approximately 0.0915.\n\nMultiply these two: 9.48 * 0.0915 ≈ 0.867\n\nDivide by 5: 0.867 /5 ≈ 0.173\n\nSo the constant factor is approximately 0.173, not 0.123 as I previously estimated. So that's a factor of ~0.17 instead of 0.1. Let's use this more accurate value.\n\nSo then, R ≈ 0.173 * ħ² / ( G M^(1/3) m^(8/3) )\n\nRecomputing the numerator:\n\n0.173 * ħ² = 0.173 * 1.112e-68 kg^2 m^4 / s^2 ≈ 0.173 *1.112e-68 ≈ 1.92e-69 kg^2 m^4/s^2\n\nDenominator: same as before, 2.87e-72 m^3 s^{-2} kg^2\n\nSo R ≈ (1.92e-69) / (2.87e-72) ≈ 1.92 / 2.87 * 1e3 ≈ 0.669 * 1e3 ≈ 669 meters. Still around 670 meters. Still way too small. Hmm. There must be a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, maybe the gravitational pressure estimate is incorrect. Earlier, I assumed P_grav ~ G M² / R^4, but maybe that's not the right way to estimate it. Let's think again.\n\nThe correct approach for hydrostatic equilibrium is to balance the pressure gradient with gravity. For a star, the condition is dP/dr = - G M(r) ρ(r) / r², where M(r) is the mass enclosed within radius r, and ρ(r) is the density. But since we're making a rough estimate, maybe we can approximate the central pressure as P ~ G M² / R^4. But perhaps a better approximation is P ~ (3 G M²)/(8 π R^4). Let me check some references.\n\nAlternatively, using the virial theorem: for a star in hydrostatic equilibrium, the average pressure needed is P ~ (3/4π) (G M²)/R^4. So maybe the gravitational pressure is of order (G M²)/R^4. So my initial assumption was correct. Then why is the radius coming out too small?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the expression for the Fermi pressure. Let me check the formula again.\n\nThe pressure for a nonrelativistic degenerate Fermi gas is given by:\n\nP = ( (3π²)^(2/3) / 5 ) * (ħ² / m) * n^(5/3)\n\nYes, that's correct. So substituting n = (M/m)/( (4/3) π R³ ) = 3 M/(4 π m R³ )\n\nSo n = (3 M)/(4 π m R³ )\n\nThen n^(5/3) = (3/(4 π))^(5/3) (M/(m R³ ))^(5/3 )\n\nSo P = (3π²)^(2/3) /5 * ħ²/m * (3/(4 π))^(5/3) (M/(m R³ ))^(5/3 )\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n[ (3π²)^(2/3) * (3/(4 π))^(5/3) /5 ] * ħ²/m * (M/(m R³ ))^(5/3 )\n\nWhich is the same as before. So the expression seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the neutron mass. Let me check: neutron mass is approximately 1.675e-27 kg. Yes.\n\nWait, let's compute the entire expression step by step with the more accurate constants.\n\nLet me write R in terms of the variables:\n\nR ≈ (0.173 ħ² ) / ( G M^(1/3) m^(8/3) )\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s². But in terms of units, J = kg m²/s², so ħ² has units kg² m^4 / s².\n\nG = 6.6743e-11 m³ kg^{-1} s^{-2}\n\nM = 1e30 kg\n\nm = 1.67492749804e-27 kg\n\nCompute M^(1/3) = (1e30)^(1/3) = 1e10 kg^{1/3}\n\nm^(8/3) = (1.67492749804e-27 kg)^(8/3) = (1.67492749804e-27)^(8/3) kg^(8/3)\n\nFirst compute (1.67492749804e-27)^(1/3):\n\n≈ (1.6749)^(1/3) * 1e-9 ≈ 1.19 * 1e-9 = 1.19e-9\n\nThen raise to 8th power: (1.19e-9)^8 ≈ (1.19)^8 * 1e-72 ≈ 4.3 * 1e-72\n\nSo m^(8/3) ≈ 4.3e-72 kg^(8/3)\n\nNow compute denominator: G * M^(1/3) * m^(8/3) = 6.6743e-11 * 1e10 * 4.3e-72\n\n6.6743e-11 * 1e10 = 6.6743e-1\n\n6.6743e-1 * 4.3e-72 ≈ 2.87e-72\n\nNumerator: 0.173 * ħ² = 0.173 * 1.112e-68 ≈ 1.92e-69\n\nSo R ≈ 1.92e-69 / 2.87e-72 ≈ 1.92 / 2.87 * 1e3 ≈ 0.669 * 1e3 ≈ 669 meters.\n\nBut this is way too small. Real neutron stars have radii ~10 km. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe the assumption of nonrelativistic Fermi gas is incorrect. The problem states to use nonrelativistic, but maybe in reality, neutron stars are supported by relativistic degeneracy pressure. However, the problem explicitly says to use nonrelativistic, so I have to go with that. But then why the discrepancy?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mass given is 1e33 grams, which is 1e30 kg, but maybe I made a mistake in converting grams to kg. Wait, 1e33 grams is 1e30 kg. Yes. 1e3 grams = 1 kg, so 1e33 grams = 1e33 / 1e3 = 1e30 kg. Correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the actual mass of a neutron star is around 1.4 solar masses. Solar mass is ~2e30 kg, so 1.4 solar masses is ~2.8e30 kg. But the problem states 1e30 kg, which is about 0.5 solar masses. Maybe lower mass neutron stars have larger radii? Wait, no, actually for white dwarfs, lower mass means larger radius, but for neutron stars, the radius is roughly constant or slightly decreases with increasing mass. But I'm not sure. Anyway, the calculation here gives ~1 km, but real neutron stars are ~10 km. So there's a factor of 10 discrepancy. But the problem says \"to within an order of magnitude\", so if my answer is 1 km and the real answer is 10 km, that's within an order of magnitude. But wait, my calculation gives ~700 meters, which is 0.7 km, so an order of magnitude would be up to 7 km. But real ones are 10 km, so maybe it's acceptable. But why the discrepancy?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the approximation in the gravitational pressure is missing a factor. Let's think: when we equate the Fermi pressure to the gravitational pressure, perhaps the gravitational potential energy per unit volume is ~ (3/5) G M² / R^5. Because gravitational potential energy is ~ - (3/5) G M² / R, and if we divide by volume ( (4/3) π R³ ), we get energy per volume ~ - (9/20 π) G M² / R^4. But pressure is energy density, so maybe P_grav ~ G M² / R^4. But perhaps the coefficient is different. For example, if U_grav ~ - (3/5) G M² / R, then the average pressure would be U_grav / (3 V) ≈ - (3/5) G M² / R / (3 * (4/3 π R³ )) ) = - (3/5) G M² / (4 π R^4 ). So |P| ~ (3/(20 π)) G M² / R^4. So maybe the gravitational pressure is (3/(20 π)) G M² / R^4 instead of G M² / R^4. That would introduce a factor of 3/(20 π) ≈ 0.0477. So if I use P_grav ≈ 0.0477 G M² / R^4 instead of G M² / R^4, then when I equate to P_Fermi, I would have:\n\n0.173 * ħ² M^(5/3) / ( R^5 m^(8/3) ) ≈ 0.0477 G M² / R^4\n\nMultiply both sides by R^5:\n\n0.173 ħ² M^(5/3) / m^(8/3) ≈ 0.0477 G M² R\n\nThen R ≈ (0.173 / 0.0477) * ħ² / (G M^(1/3) m^(8/3) )\n\n0.173 / 0.0477 ≈ 3.627\n\nSo R ≈ 3.627 * ħ² / (G M^(1/3) m^(8/3) )\n\nUsing the same numbers as before:\n\n3.627 * 669 meters ≈ 2428 meters, which is ~2.4 km. Still too small. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the gravitational potential energy estimate is different. Let's try another approach using the virial theorem.\n\nThe virial theorem states that for a system in equilibrium, the average kinetic energy is half the gravitational potential energy: 2K + U = 0 => K ≈ -U/2.\n\nFor the neutron star, the kinetic energy K is the total Fermi energy of the neutrons, and U is the gravitational potential energy.\n\nThe total Fermi energy can be approximated as K ≈ N * E_F, where N is the number of neutrons and E_F is the Fermi energy per neutron.\n\nNumber of neutrons N = M / m.\n\nFermi energy E_F = (ħ² / (2m)) * (3π² n)^(2/3), where n = N / V = 3M/(4 π R³ m).\n\nSo E_F = (ħ² / (2m)) * (3π² * 3M/(4 π R³ m))^(2/3)\n\nSimplify inside the brackets: 3π² * 3M/(4 π R³ m) = (9 π M)/(4 R³ m) )\n\nSo E_F = (ħ² / (2m)) * (9 π M/(4 R³ m))^(2/3)\n\nThus, total kinetic energy K ≈ N * E_F = (M/m) * (ħ² / (2m)) * (9 π M/(4 R³ m))^(2/3)\n\nSimplify:\n\nK = (M/m) * (ħ² / (2m)) * (9 π /4 )^(2/3) * (M/(R³ m))^(2/3)\n\n= (ħ² / (2 m²)) * (9 π /4 )^(2/3) * M^(1 + 2/3) / (R² m^(2/3))\n\n= (ħ² / (2 m²)) * (9 π /4 )^(2/3) * M^(5/3) / (R² m^(2/3))\n\n= (ħ² / (2 m^(8/3)) ) * (9 π /4 )^(2/3) * M^(5/3) / R²\n\nCompute the constant factor:\n\n(9 π /4 )^(2/3) = (9/4)^(2/3) * π^(2/3)\n\n(9/4)^(2/3) = ( (3/2)^2 )^(2/3) = (3/2)^(4/3) ≈ (1.5)^(1.333) ≈ 1.5^(1) * 1.5^(0.333) ≈ 1.5 * 1.145 ≈ 1.7175\n\nπ^(2/3) ≈ (3.1416)^(2/3) ≈ (2.145) ≈ 2.145\n\nSo (9 π /4 )^(2/3) ≈ 1.7175 * 2.145 ≈ 3.684\n\nThus, K ≈ (ħ² / (2 m^(8/3)) ) * 3.684 * M^(5/3) / R²\n\nGravitational potential energy U ≈ - (3/5) G M² / R\n\nFrom virial theorem, K ≈ |U| / 2 = (3/10) G M² / R\n\nSo set K = (3/10) G M² / R:\n\n(ħ² / (2 m^(8/3)) ) * 3.684 * M^(5/3) / R² = (3/10) G M² / R\n\nMultiply both sides by R²:\n\n(ħ² / (2 m^(8/3)) ) * 3.684 * M^(5/3) = (3/10) G M² R\n\nSolve for R:\n\nR = (10/3) * (ħ² / (2 m^(8/3)) ) * 3.684 * M^(5/3) / (G M² )\n\nSimplify:\n\nR = (10/3) * (3.684 / 2) * ħ² / (G m^(8/3) ) * M^(5/3 - 2)\n\nM^(5/3 - 2) = M^(-1/3) = 1/M^(1/3)\n\nSo:\n\nR = (10/3) * (3.684 / 2) * ħ² / (G M^(1/3) m^(8/3) )\n\nCompute the constants:\n\n(10/3) * (3.684 / 2) = (10/3) * 1.842 ≈ 3.333 * 1.842 ≈ 6.14\n\nSo R ≈ 6.14 * ħ² / (G M^(1/3) m^(8/3) )\n\nUsing the same values as before:\n\nħ² = 1.112e-68 kg² m⁴/s²\n\nG = 6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²\n\nM^(1/3) = 1e10 kg^(1/3)\n\nm^(8/3) = 4.3e-72 kg^(8/3)\n\nDenominator: G * M^(1/3) * m^(8/3) ≈ 6.6743e-11 * 1e10 * 4.3e-72 ≈ 6.6743e-1 * 4.3e-72 ≈ 2.87e-72\n\nNumerator: 6.14 * 1.112e-68 ≈ 6.14 * 1.112e-68 ≈ 6.83e-68\n\nSo R ≈ 6.83e-68 / 2.87e-72 ≈ 6.83 / 2.87 * 1e4 ≈ 2.38 * 1e4 ≈ 2.38e4 meters, which is 23,800 meters or 23.8 km. That's too large. Real neutron stars are ~10 km. But within an order of magnitude, 23.8 km is acceptable (answer is 10 km, so within a factor of ~2.4). But why does this approach give a larger radius?\n\nWait, but the virial theorem approach gave R ≈ 24 km, while the previous pressure balance approach gave ~0.7 km. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nThe virial theorem is more accurate because it takes into account the global balance of energy, whereas the pressure balance might have incorrect scaling. The virial theorem result of ~24 km is closer to the real value of ~10 km, but still a factor of ~2-3 off. Given that the problem allows for order of magnitude estimates, 24 km is within an order of magnitude of 10 km. But why is there such a difference between the two methods?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mistake is in the calculation of the constants. Let's recheck the virial theorem derivation.\n\nThe virial theorem gives K ≈ (3/10) G M² / R.\n\nThe kinetic energy K was calculated as:\n\nK ≈ (ħ² / (2 m^(8/3)) ) * 3.684 * M^(5/3) / R²\n\nSetting equal to (3/10) G M² / R:\n\n(ħ² / (2 m^(8/3)) ) * 3.684 * M^(5/3) / R² = (3/10) G M² / R\n\nMultiply both sides by R²:\n\n(ħ² / (2 m^(8/3)) ) * 3.684 * M^(5/3) = (3/10) G M² R\n\nSolve for R:\n\nR = (10/3) * (ħ² / (2 m^(8/3)) ) * 3.684 * M^(5/3) / (G M² )\n\nSimplify exponents:\n\nM^(5/3) / M² = M^(5/3 - 6/3) = M^(-1/3)\n\nSo:\n\nR = (10/3) * (3.684 / 2) * ħ² / (G m^(8/3) M^(1/3) )\n\nCompute the constant factor:\n\n(10/3) * (3.684 / 2) = (10/3) * 1.842 ≈ 6.14\n\nSo R ≈ 6.14 * ħ² / (G m^(8/3) M^(1/3) )\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n6.14 * 1.112e-68 / (6.6743e-11 * 4.3e-72 * 1e10 )\n\nWait, denominator:\n\nG = 6.6743e-11\n\nm^(8/3) = 4.3e-72\n\nM^(1/3) = 1e10\n\nSo denominator: 6.6743e-11 * 4.3e-72 * 1e10 = 6.6743e-11 * 4.3e-62 = 6.6743 * 4.3e-73 ≈ 28.7e-73 = 2.87e-72\n\nNumerator: 6.14 * 1.112e-68 ≈ 6.83e-68\n\nSo R ≈ 6.83e-68 / 2.87e-72 ≈ 6.83 / 2.87 * 1e4 ≈ 2.38 * 1e4 ≈ 2.38e4 meters = 23.8 km\n\nBut this is still larger than the typical 10 km.

{"id": "atomic/2-40", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the half-life of Uranium-235 (U-235) from the given options: 10^3, 10^6, 10^9, 10^12 years. Hmm, I remember that half-life is the time it takes for half of a radioactive substance to decay. But wait, what's the actual half-life of U-235? Let me think.\n\nI recall that Uranium has two main isotopes: U-235 and U-238. U-238 is more abundant, and I think it has a longer half-life. The half-life of U-238 is around 4.5 billion years, right? So 4.5×10^9 years. But the question is about U-235. Since U-235 is less abundant, maybe its half-life is shorter? Wait, no, actually, the abundance might relate to the half-life. If U-238 is more abundant, perhaps because it decays more slowly, meaning longer half-life. So U-235, being less abundant, would have a shorter half-life than U-238. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me check my memory.\n\nWait, I think the half-life of U-235 is actually around 700 million years. Let me confirm. Yes, I remember that U-235 has a half-life of approximately 703 million years. So converting that to scientific notation, 703 million is 7.03×10^8 years. But the options given are 10^3, 10^6, 10^9, 10^12. So 10^9 is 1 billion years. The actual half-life is about 0.7 billion, which is closer to 10^9 than 10^8. But wait, 10^9 is 1,000,000,000 years. So 0.7×10^9 is 7×10^8. But the options don't have 10^8. The closest one is 10^9. Hmm, but maybe the question is simplified. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the isotopes.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. U-238's half-life is about 4.5×10^9 years, which is 4.5 billion. U-235's half-life is indeed shorter. Let me check exact numbers. From what I remember, U-235's half-life is approximately 703.8 million years. So 703.8 million is 7.038×10^8 years. So that's 0.7038×10^9. So in the options given, 10^9 is the closest. But wait, the options are 10^3 (1,000), 10^6 (1 million), 10^9 (1 billion), 10^12 (1 trillion). So 10^9 is 1 billion, which is higher than the actual 0.7 billion. But maybe the question is using an approximate value. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 10^9 years. But I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm confusing the half-life of U-235 with another isotope. Let me try to recall. For example, Carbon-14 has a half-life of about 5,700 years, which is 10^4 order. But that's not relevant here. Plutonium-239 has a half-life of around 24,000 years. But again, not related. So back to Uranium. U-235's half-life is indeed around 700 million years. So 7×10^8. But the options given are 10^3, 10^6, 10^9, 10^12. So 10^9 is 1,000,000,000, which is 1 billion. The actual value is 0.7 billion. So perhaps the answer is 10^9 years. Maybe the question is rounding to the nearest order of magnitude. 0.7×10^9 is closer to 10^9 than to 10^8 (which is 100 million). Since 10^8 isn't an option here, the closest available is 10^9. Therefore, the correct answer should be 10^9 years.\n</think>\n\nThe half-life of Uranium-235 (U-235) is approximately **703 million years**, which is closest to \\(10^9\\) years when rounded to the nearest order of magnitude.

{"id": "atomic/4-1", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve part (a) of this physics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about an accelerator at SLAC with electron and positron bunches colliding head-on. Each bunch has 50 GeV energy in the lab frame. Each bunch is a cylinder with uniform charge density, radius 1 micron, and length 2 mm in the lab. Part (a) asks: To an observer traveling with a bunch, what are the radius and length of its bunch and also the one of opposite sign?\n\nHmm. So this is a special relativity problem involving length contraction. Since the observer is moving with the bunch, their own bunch should be at rest, so its dimensions should be the proper dimensions. The opposite bunch, which is moving towards them at high speed, should have contracted length. But wait, the radius is perpendicular to the direction of motion, so it shouldn't be contracted. But wait, the problem says each bunch is moving in the lab frame, right? Because they collide head-on. So in the lab frame, each bunch is moving towards each other. So from the perspective of an observer traveling with one bunch, their own bunch is at rest, and the opposite bunch is moving towards them at a speed close to the speed of light. \n\nFirst, I need to find the gamma factor for the electrons/positrons with 50 GeV energy. Since electrons are light, 50 GeV is way more than their rest mass energy (which is about 0.511 MeV). So gamma is approximately E/(m c²) = 50 GeV / 0.511 MeV ≈ 50,000 / 0.511 ≈ 97,846. So gamma is roughly 10^5? Wait, 50 GeV divided by 0.511 GeV (since 0.511 MeV is 0.000511 GeV). Wait, wait, 0.511 MeV is the rest energy. So 50 GeV / 0.000511 GeV ≈ 50 / 0.000511 ≈ let's calculate that. 50 divided by 0.0005 is 100,000, but 0.000511 is a bit more, so maybe around 97,800. So gamma ≈ 97,800. That's a very high gamma factor. \n\nSo for the observer in the rest frame of the bunch (say, the electron bunch), their own bunch has proper dimensions: radius 1 micron, length 2 mm. But wait, in the lab frame, the length is 2 mm. Wait, but in the lab frame, the bunch is moving, so its length is contracted. Wait, no. Wait, the problem states: \"as measured in the laboratory\". So in the lab frame, the bunch has length 2 mm. But if the bunch is moving in the lab frame, then its proper length (in its rest frame) should be longer by gamma. Wait, but the problem says \"may be taken to be a cylinder of uniform charge density with a radius of 1 micron and a length of 2 mm as measured in the laboratory.\" So in the lab frame, the length is 2 mm. So in the rest frame of the bunch, the length would be gamma times longer. But since gamma is ~10^5, that would make the proper length 2 mm * 10^5 = 200 meters. That seems really long. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the length in the lab frame is the direction of motion. So when the bunch is moving at speed v relative to the lab, its length in the lab is contracted by gamma. So the proper length (in the bunch's rest frame) is longer. So if the lab measures the length as L_lab = 2 mm, then the proper length L_rest = gamma * L_lab. So yes, with gamma ~ 1e5, that would be 2e-3 m * 1e5 = 200 m. That seems correct. But that's a huge length. But given that the gamma factor is so high, maybe that's right. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"each bunch may be taken to be a cylinder... as measured in the laboratory\". So the radius is 1 micron (perpendicular to motion, so same in all frames), and length 2 mm (along the direction of motion, so contracted in the lab frame). Therefore, in the rest frame of the bunch, the length is gamma * 2 mm. So for the observer traveling with the bunch, their own bunch has radius 1 micron and length gamma * 2 mm. But wait, gamma is 1e5, so 2 mm * 1e5 = 200 meters. That's correct. \n\nBut then, the opposite bunch is moving towards them. So from the rest frame of the observer (say, the electron bunch's frame), the positron bunch is moving towards them at a speed of... Well, in the lab frame, each bunch has speed v. Let's compute v. For gamma = 1e5, the speed is very close to c. The relation between gamma and beta (v/c) is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). For gamma ≈ 1e5, beta ≈ 1 - (1/(2 gamma²)) approximately. So beta ≈ 1 - 5e-11. So v ≈ c. \n\nBut when transforming to the rest frame of one bunch, the opposite bunch is moving at a speed that's not just 2v, because velocities don't add linearly. The lab frame sees each bunch moving at speed v towards each other. So in the rest frame of one bunch, the lab is moving at speed v, and the opposite bunch is moving at speed (v + v)/(1 + v²/c²) = (2v)/(1 + v²/c²). But since v ≈ c, this becomes (2c)/(1 + 1) = c. Wait, but that can't be. Wait, actually, when you have two objects moving towards each other at speed v in the lab frame, the speed of one in the rest frame of the other is (2v)/(1 + (v²/c²)). But if v ≈ c, then denominator is 1 + 1 = 2, so speed is (2c)/2 = c. Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe I need to use the exact velocity addition formula. Let me recall. \n\nIf in the lab frame, the electron bunch is moving at velocity +v, and the positron bunch is moving at -v (head-on), then in the electron bunch's rest frame, the lab is moving at -v, and the positron bunch's velocity u' is given by the velocity addition formula:\n\nu' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²)\n\nIn the lab frame, the positron's velocity u is -v. So substituting:\n\nu' = (-v - v)/(1 - (-v)(v)/c²) = (-2v)/(1 + v²/c²)\n\nBut if v is very close to c, then v²/c² ≈ 1, so denominator is 1 + 1 = 2, so u' ≈ (-2c)/2 = -c. But that's just an approximation. However, since gamma is so large, beta is approximately 1 - 1/(2 gamma²). Let's compute beta. For gamma = 1e5, beta ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) ≈ 1 - 1/(2 gamma²). So beta ≈ 1 - 5e-11. So v ≈ c (1 - 5e-11). Then, substituting into the velocity addition formula:\n\nu' = (-2v)/(1 + (v²/c²)) ≈ (-2c(1 - 5e-11))/(1 + (1 - 1e-10)) ≈ (-2c(1 - 5e-11))/(2 - 1e-10) ≈ (-c(1 - 5e-11))/(1 - 5e-11) ≈ -c. So the speed of the positron bunch in the electron's rest frame is approximately -c. But actually, it's slightly less than c. However, for the purposes of calculating length contraction, the gamma factor between the lab frame and the positron's rest frame is the same as the original gamma. Wait, no. Wait, in the electron's rest frame, the positron bunch is moving at a speed that's a combination of the lab's speed and the positron's speed in the lab. \n\nBut perhaps an easier way is to compute the length of the opposite bunch as seen in the electron's rest frame. In the lab frame, the positron bunch has length L_lab = 2 mm. But in the positron's rest frame, its proper length is L_rest = gamma * L_lab. But when observed from the electron's rest frame, which sees the positron bunch moving at speed u' ≈ -c, the length would be contracted by gamma', where gamma' is the Lorentz factor between the electron's rest frame and the positron's rest frame. Wait, but the positron's rest frame is moving at speed u' = - (2v)/(1 + v²/c²) ≈ -c. So the gamma factor between the electron's frame and the positron's frame is gamma_total = (1 + (u')²/c²)^(-1/2). Wait, no. The gamma factor between two frames moving at speed u relative to each other is gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - u²/c²). So if in the electron's frame, the positron bunch is moving at speed u', then gamma' = 1/sqrt(1 - (u')²/c²). But since u' ≈ -c, gamma' would be very large. Wait, but this seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. \n\nAlternatively, since in the lab frame, each bunch has length L_lab = 2 mm (contracted from their proper length). The proper length of each bunch is L_rest = gamma * L_lab. Now, in the electron's rest frame, the lab is moving at speed -v, and the positron bunch is moving at speed u' ≈ -c. The length of the positron bunch in the electron's frame would be the lab length contracted by the gamma factor between the lab and the electron's frame. Wait, the positron bunch's length in the lab is L_lab = 2 mm. In the electron's rest frame, the lab is moving at speed -v, so the positron bunch, which is at rest in the lab frame (no, wait, no. Wait, in the lab frame, both bunches are moving towards each other. So the positron bunch is moving at speed -v in the lab frame. So in the electron's rest frame, the lab is moving at speed -v, and the positron bunch is moving at speed u' as calculated before. The length of the positron bunch in the electron's frame would be L = L_lab / gamma', where gamma' is the Lorentz factor between the lab frame and the electron's frame. Wait, but the lab frame is moving at speed v relative to the electron's frame. So gamma' is the same as the original gamma, which is ~1e5. Therefore, the length of the positron bunch in the electron's frame is L = L_lab / gamma' = 2 mm / 1e5 ≈ 2e-8 m = 20 nm. Wait, but that seems contradictory. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the positron bunch's proper length is gamma * L_lab. But in the lab frame, the positron bunch is moving, so its length is contracted to L_lab. In the electron's rest frame, the positron bunch is moving even faster (since the lab is moving at -v, and the positron is moving at -v in the lab frame, so in the electron's frame, the positron's speed is higher). Therefore, the length contraction would be more. So the length of the positron bunch in the electron's frame would be L = L_lab / gamma_total, where gamma_total is the gamma factor between the positron's rest frame and the electron's rest frame. But since the positron's rest frame is moving at speed u' relative to the electron's frame, gamma_total = 1/sqrt(1 - (u')²/c²). But calculating u' is complicated. However, since the lab frame sees both bunches moving at speed v, and the electron's rest frame is moving at speed v relative to the lab, then the positron's speed in the electron's rest frame is (using velocity addition):\n\nu' = (-v - v)/(1 + v²/c²) = (-2v)/(1 + v²/c²)\n\nGiven that v ≈ c, then u' ≈ (-2c)/(1 + 1) = -c. So the speed is approximately -c. Therefore, gamma_total would be approximately 1/sqrt(1 - (c²/c²)) = infinity, but that's not possible. Wait, but actually, since v is slightly less than c, u' is slightly less than -c. Let's compute more accurately. Let's let beta = v/c ≈ 1 - delta, where delta is small. Then, beta = 1 - delta, so delta ≈ 1/(2 gamma²) ≈ 1/(2*(1e5)^2) ≈ 5e-11. Then, u'/c = [ -2 beta ] / [1 + beta²]. Let's compute beta²: (1 - delta)^2 ≈ 1 - 2 delta. So denominator is 1 + 1 - 2 delta = 2 - 2 delta ≈ 2. Numerator is -2*(1 - delta) ≈ -2 + 2 delta. So u'/c ≈ (-2 + 2 delta)/2 ≈ -1 + delta. Therefore, u' ≈ -c (1 - delta). Therefore, the speed is slightly less than -c. Then, gamma_total = 1/sqrt(1 - (u')²/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - (1 - delta)^2) ≈ 1/sqrt(2 delta - delta²) ≈ 1/sqrt(2 delta). Since delta ≈ 1/(2 gamma²), then sqrt(2 delta) = sqrt(1/gamma²) = 1/gamma. Therefore, gamma_total ≈ 1/(1/gamma) ) = gamma. Wait, that can't be. Wait, let's substitute delta = 1/(2 gamma²). Then, 2 delta = 1/gamma². So sqrt(2 delta) = 1/gamma. Therefore, gamma_total ≈ 1/sqrt(2 delta) = gamma. Therefore, gamma_total = gamma. So the gamma factor between the electron's frame and the positron's frame is gamma. Therefore, the length of the positron bunch in the electron's frame is L = L_rest_positron / gamma_total. But the positron's proper length is L_rest_positron = gamma * L_lab. Therefore, L = (gamma * L_lab) / gamma = L_lab. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no. Wait, in the positron's rest frame, its length is gamma * L_lab. Then, in the electron's frame, which is moving at gamma_total = gamma relative to the positron's frame, the length is contracted by gamma. So L = (gamma * L_lab) / gamma = L_lab. That would mean that in the electron's frame, the positron bunch has length L_lab = 2 mm. But that contradicts the earlier thought. Hmm, maybe I messed up the reference frames here. Let's clarify.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Lab frame: S\n\n- Electron bunch rest frame: S'\n\n- Positron bunch rest frame: S''\n\nIn the lab frame S, both bunches are moving towards each other with speed v. The length of each bunch in S is L_lab = 2 mm (contracted from their proper lengths). The proper length of each bunch in their own rest frames (S' and S'') is L_rest = gamma * L_lab.\n\nNow, in the electron's rest frame S', the lab frame S is moving at speed -v. The positron bunch, which is at rest in S'' (moving at speed -v in S), is moving at some speed u' in S'. To find the length of the positron bunch in S', we need to consider how the length transforms. \n\nThe length of the positron bunch in S'' is L_rest = gamma * L_lab. In S', which is moving at speed u relative to S'', the length would be contracted by gamma', where gamma' is the Lorentz factor between S' and S''. But the speed of S' relative to S'' is the same as the speed of the electron bunch relative to the positron bunch. Since in the lab frame, they are moving towards each other at speed v each, the relative speed between S' and S'' is the same as the relative speed between the electron and positron bunches. \n\nBut calculating this relative speed: in the lab frame, the electron is moving at +v, positron at -v. So their relative speed is (v + v)/(1 + v²/c²) = 2v/(1 + v²/c²). As before, when v ≈ c, this is approximately c. But more accurately, using beta ≈ 1 - delta, we found that the relative speed is approximately c(1 - delta), leading to a gamma factor between S' and S'' of gamma_total ≈ gamma. Therefore, the length of the positron bunch in S' would be L_rest_positron / gamma_total = (gamma * L_lab) / gamma = L_lab. So in the electron's rest frame, the positron bunch has the same length as in the lab frame? That seems odd. But maybe that's correct. Wait, but in the lab frame, the positron bunch is moving, so its length is contracted. In the positron's rest frame, its length is longer. But when observed from the electron's frame, which is moving relative to the positron's frame, the length is contracted again. So the contraction from the positron's rest frame to the electron's frame cancels the original contraction from the positron's rest frame to the lab frame. Therefore, in the electron's frame, the positron bunch has the same length as in the lab frame. But that seems counterintuitive. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let's think differently. The length of an object in a frame where it's moving is its proper length divided by gamma. The proper length of the positron bunch is gamma * L_lab. So in the electron's frame, the positron bunch is moving with some speed, so its length should be (gamma * L_lab) divided by the gamma factor between the electron's frame and the positron's frame. If the gamma between them is gamma_total, then the length is (gamma * L_lab)/gamma_total. But if gamma_total = gamma, then it's L_lab. But why would gamma_total be gamma? Let's see. The gamma between the electron's frame and the lab frame is gamma. The gamma between the lab frame and the positron's frame is also gamma (since the positron is moving at speed v in the lab frame). Therefore, the total gamma between the electron's frame and the positron's frame is gamma^2? Wait, no. Velocity addition doesn't multiply gammas. The total gamma would be calculated based on the relative velocity between S' and S''. Let me compute the relative velocity between the electron's frame and the positron's frame. \n\nIn the lab frame, the electron is moving at +v, the positron at -v. So in the electron's frame (S'), the lab is moving at -v, and the positron is moving at u' = (-v - v)/(1 + v²/c²) = -2v/(1 + v²/c²). As before, with v ≈ c, this is approximately -c. The gamma factor between S' and S'' is gamma_total = 1/sqrt(1 - (u')²/c²). Let's compute (u')²/c²:\n\n(u')²/c² = [4v²/(1 + v²/c²)^2] / c² = [4 beta²/(1 + beta²)^2]\n\nWhere beta = v/c ≈ 1 - delta. Then, beta² ≈ 1 - 2 delta. So:\n\n(u')²/c² ≈ 4 (1 - 2 delta) / (1 + 1 - 2 delta)^2 ≈ 4 (1 - 2 delta) / (4 - 8 delta) ≈ [4 - 8 delta] / [4 - 8 delta] = 1. Wait, that's not possible. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working. Let's instead use the exact expression for gamma_total. \n\nGiven that u' = -2v/(1 + v²/c²), then:\n\ngamma_total = 1 / sqrt(1 - (u')²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - [4v²/(1 + v²/c²)^2]/c²) \n\n= 1 / sqrt(1 - [4 beta²/(1 + beta²)^2])\n\nLet me compute this expression. Let’s set beta = v/c. Then:\n\ngamma_total = 1 / sqrt(1 - [4 beta²/(1 + beta²)^2])\n\nLet’s simplify the denominator:\n\n1 - [4 beta²/(1 + beta²)^2] = [ (1 + beta²)^2 - 4 beta² ] / (1 + beta²)^2\n\n= [1 + 2 beta² + beta^4 - 4 beta²] / (1 + beta²)^2\n\n= [1 - 2 beta² + beta^4] / (1 + beta²)^2\n\n= (1 - beta²)^2 / (1 + beta²)^2\n\nTherefore, gamma_total = 1 / sqrt( (1 - beta²)^2 / (1 + beta²)^2 ) ) = (1 + beta²)/(1 - beta²)\n\nBut 1 - beta² = 1/gamma², and 1 + beta² = 1 + (1 - 1/gamma²) = 2 - 1/gamma² ≈ 2 for large gamma. Therefore, gamma_total ≈ (2)/(1/gamma²) ) = 2 gamma². Wait, that can't be. Wait, let's substitute 1 - beta² = 1/gamma², so:\n\ngamma_total = (1 + beta²)/(1 - beta²) = [ (1 + beta²) ] * gamma²\n\nBut beta² = 1 - 1/gamma², so:\n\ngamma_total = [1 + 1 - 1/gamma²] * gamma² = [2 - 1/gamma²] * gamma² = 2 gamma² - 1\n\nTherefore, for large gamma, gamma_total ≈ 2 gamma². \n\nSo gamma_total ≈ 2 gamma². Therefore, the length of the positron bunch in the electron's frame is L = L_rest_positron / gamma_total = (gamma * L_lab) / (2 gamma²) ) = L_lab / (2 gamma). \n\nWait, that's different. So with gamma ~ 1e5, L_lab = 2 mm, then L = 2e-3 m / (2 * 1e5) ) = 1e-8 m = 10 nm. So the length of the opposite bunch in the observer's frame is 10 nm, and the radius remains 1 micron (since it's perpendicular to motion). \n\nBut wait, the radius of the opposite bunch: since the motion is along the length, the radial direction is perpendicular, so the radius should be the same in all frames. So the radius of the opposite bunch is also 1 micron. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the radius and length of its bunch and also the one of opposite sign\". So for the observer traveling with a bunch, their own bunch has radius 1 micron (proper dimensions), length gamma * L_lab (since in the lab frame it's contracted, so proper length is longer). Wait, no. Wait, in the lab frame, the length is L_lab = 2 mm. But in the bunch's rest frame, the length should be longer by gamma. So L_rest = gamma * L_lab. Therefore, for the observer with the bunch, their own bunch has length gamma * 2 mm, and radius 1 micron. The opposite bunch has length contracted by gamma_total, which we found to be L = L_lab / (2 gamma), and radius 1 micron. \n\nWait, but this seems conflicting. Let me recap:\n\nOwn bunch (at rest):\n\n- Radius: 1 micron (same as lab, since perpendicular)\n\n- Length: gamma * 2 mm (proper length)\n\nOpposite bunch (moving at high speed):\n\n- Radius: 1 micron (perpendicular, same)\n\n- Length: contracted by gamma_total = 2 gamma², so L = (gamma * 2 mm) / (2 gamma²) ) = (2 mm) / (2 gamma) ) = 1 mm / gamma. Wait, but earlier steps gave different results. I think I need to clarify this properly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a simpler approach. Let's consider that in the lab frame, each bunch has length L = 2 mm (contracted). The proper length L0 = gamma * L. In the rest frame of the bunch, the length is L0 = gamma * 2 mm. \n\nNow, the opposite bunch, in the lab frame, has length L = 2 mm. But in the rest frame of our bunch, the lab is moving at speed -v, and the opposite bunch is moving at speed u' ≈ -c. The length of the opposite bunch in our frame is the lab length contracted by the gamma factor between the lab and our frame. Since our frame is moving at speed v relative to the lab, the gamma factor is gamma. Therefore, the length of the opposite bunch in our frame is L' = L_lab / gamma = 2 mm / gamma. \n\nBut wait, that makes sense. Because in the lab frame, the opposite bunch has length 2 mm. Since our frame is moving at speed v relative to the lab, lengths in the lab are contracted by gamma in our frame. Wait, no. If we are moving at speed v relative to the lab, then lengths at rest in the lab are contracted by gamma in our frame. But the opposite bunch is moving in the lab, so its length in the lab is already contracted. So to find its length in our frame, we need to consider both contractions. \n\nAlternatively, the length of the opposite bunch in our frame can be found by taking the proper length of the opposite bunch (gamma * L_lab) and contracting it by the gamma factor between our frame and the opposite bunch's rest frame. Which we found earlier to be gamma_total ≈ 2 gamma². Therefore, L' = (gamma * L_lab) / (2 gamma²) ) = L_lab / (2 gamma). \n\nBut this gives a very small length, like 2 mm / (2 * 1e5) ) = 1e-5 mm = 1e-8 m = 10 nm. \n\nBut which approach is correct? \n\nAlternatively, let's use the Lorentz transformation for length. The length of an object moving at speed u is L' = L_lab * sqrt(1 - u²/c²). But wait, no. The length contraction formula is L' = L_lab / gamma, where gamma is the Lorentz factor of the moving object relative to the frame. \n\nWait, in the lab frame, the opposite bunch has length L_lab = 2 mm. In our frame (electron's rest frame), the lab is moving at -v, and the opposite bunch is moving at u' = (-2v)/(1 + v²/c²). The length of the opposite bunch in our frame would be the lab length contracted by the gamma factor between the lab and our frame. Since the lab is moving at speed v relative to us, gamma_lab = gamma. Therefore, lengths in the lab are contracted by gamma in our frame. So the opposite bunch, which has length L_lab in the lab, would have length L' = L_lab / gamma in our frame. \n\nBut wait, the opposite bunch is moving in the lab, so its length in the lab is already L_lab = 2 mm (contracted from its proper length). Therefore, in our frame, the length would be further contracted by the gamma factor between the lab and our frame. So L' = L_lab / gamma. \n\nYes, this makes sense. Because in the lab frame, the opposite bunch's length is L_lab = 2 mm. Since the lab is moving at speed v relative to us, we see the lab's lengths contracted by gamma. Therefore, the opposite bunch's length in our frame is L' = L_lab / gamma = 2 mm / gamma. \n\nGiven gamma ~ 1e5, this gives L' ≈ 2e-3 m / 1e5 = 2e-8 m = 20 nm. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor part (a):\n\n- Observer's own bunch: radius 1 micron (same as lab, since perpendicular), length = proper length = gamma * L_lab ≈ 1e5 * 2 mm = 2e5 mm = 200 m. \n\n- Opposite bunch: radius 1 micron (perpendicular), length = L_lab / gamma ≈ 2 mm / 1e5 = 2e-8 m = 20 nm. \n\nBut wait, the problem states \"radius of 1 micron and a length of 2 mm as measured in the laboratory\". So in the lab frame, the bunch is moving, so its length is contracted. Therefore, the proper length is gamma * 2 mm. In the rest frame of the bunch, the length is gamma * 2 mm. The radius is the same, 1 micron. \n\nThe opposite bunch, in the observer's frame, is moving at nearly the speed of light, so its length is contracted by gamma_opposite, which is the gamma factor between the observer's frame and the opposite bunch's rest frame. But since the opposite bunch's rest frame is moving at speed u' ≈ -c relative to the observer, the gamma factor is very large. However, we derived earlier that the length of the opposite bunch in the observer's frame is L' = L_lab / gamma = 2 mm / gamma. \n\nTherefore, the answer for part (a) is:\n\nOwn bunch: radius 1 micron, length gamma * 2 mm ≈ 200 m.\n\nOpposite bunch: radius 1 micron, length 2 mm / gamma ≈ 20 nm.\n\nBut let's check units. 2 mm is 2e-3 m. Divided by gamma ~1e5 gives 2e-8 m, which is 20 nm. Yes. \n\nSo the observer traveling with the bunch sees their own bunch as 1 micron radius and 200 m long, and the opposite bunch as 1 micron radius and 20 nm long. \n\nThat seems extreme, but given the high gamma factor, it's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answers for part (a) are:\n\nOwn bunch: radius = 1 micron, length = gamma * 2 mm = 2 * 1e5 * 1e-3 m = 200 m.\n\nWait, 2 mm is 0.002 m. gamma is ~1e5. 0.002 m * 1e5 = 200 m. Yes.\n\nOpposite bunch: radius = 1 micron, length = 2 mm / gamma = 0.002 m / 1e5 = 2e-8 m = 20 nm.\n\nSo the answers are:\n\n(a) For the observer's own bunch: radius 1 μm, length 200 m. For the opposite bunch: radius 1 μm, length 20 nm.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the radius and length of its bunch and also the one of opposite sign\". So both bunches as seen by the observer traveling with one bunch. \n\nYes. So the observer's own bunch is at rest, so dimensions are proper: radius 1 micron, length 200 m. The opposite bunch is moving at nearly c, so length contracted to 20 nm, radius still 1 micron.\n\nTherefore, the answer for part (a) is:\n\nRadius of own bunch: 1 micron.\n\nLength of own bunch: 200 m.\n\nRadius of opposite bunch: 1 micron.\n\nLength of opposite bunch: 20 nm.\n\nSo boxed answers:\n\nOwn bunch: radius \\boxed{1~\\mu\\text{m}}, length \\boxed{200~\\text{m}}.\n\nOpposite bunch: radius \\boxed{1~\\mu\\text{m}}, length \\boxed{20~\\text{nm}}.\n\nBut the problem might want the answers in the same units as given. The original radius was given in microns, length in mm. So converting 200 m to mm would be 200,000 mm, but probably better to leave it in meters. Similarly, 20 nm is 2e-8 m, but 20 nm is acceptable.\n\nYes, so final answer for part (a):\n\nFor the observer's own bunch: radius remains 1 micron, length is gamma * 2 mm = 200 m.\n\nFor the opposite bunch: radius remains 1 micron, length is 2 mm / gamma = 20 nm.\n</think>\n\n(a) For an observer traveling with a bunch, the dimensions are as follows:  \n- **Own bunch**: The radius remains **1 μm** (perpendicular to motion, no contraction), and the length is the proper length, which is $\\gamma$ times the lab-measured length. Given $\\gamma \\approx 10^5$, the length is $2~\\text{mm} \\times \\gamma = \\boxed{200~\\text{m}}$.  \n- **Opposite bunch**: The radius remains **1 μm** (perpendicular to motion), and the length is contracted by $\\gamma$ from the lab frame. The length is $2~\\text{mm} / \\gamma = \\boxed{20~\\text{nm}}$.  \n\nFinal answers:  \n- Own bunch: Radius $\\boxed{1~\\mu\\text{m}}$, Length $\\boxed{200~\\text{m}}$.  \n- Opposite bunch: Radius $\\boxed{1~\\mu\\text{m}}$, Length $\\boxed{20~\\text{nm}}$.", "final_answers": ["1~\\mu\\text{m}", "200~\\text{m}", "1~\\mu\\text{m}", "20~\\text{nm}", "200~\\text{m}", "20~\\text{nm}",

{"id": "atomic/2-49", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about the disintegration of a deuteron when a photon hits it, and we need to find the minimum value of \\( E_\\gamma - B \\). The given information mentions that at the threshold, the final particles (neutron and proton) are stationary in the center-of-mass system. The energy of the incident photon in the deuteron's center-of-mass system is given as \\( E^* = (m_n + m_p)c^2 \\). \n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic concepts. The deuteron is a bound state of a neutron and a proton, and its binding energy \\( B \\) is given by \\( B = (m_n + m_p - M)c^2 \\), where \\( M \\) is the mass of the deuteron. The reaction here is photon-induced disintegration, so the photon must provide enough energy to break the deuteron into a free neutron and proton. \n\nThe threshold condition for a reaction to occur is when the kinetic energy of the products is zero in the center-of-mass frame. That means all the energy goes into the rest mass energy of the products. In this case, the products are the neutron and proton, so their combined rest mass energy is \\( (m_n + m_p)c^2 \\). \n\nBut wait, the deuteron itself has a rest mass \\( M \\), so the energy required to break it apart should be related to the binding energy \\( B \\). The binding energy is the difference between the rest mass of the deuteron and the sum of the rest masses of the neutron and proton. So, \\( B = (m_n + m_p - M)c^2 \\). Therefore, the photon must supply at least this energy to break the deuteron apart. However, since the deuteron is initially at rest, and the photon has some energy and momentum, we need to consider conservation of both energy and momentum. \n\nIn the lab frame, the deuteron is at rest, and the photon has energy \\( E_\\gamma \\). When the photon is absorbed, the system (deuteron + photon) must have enough energy and momentum such that after the reaction, the neutron and proton are produced. At threshold, their kinetic energy is minimized, which in the center-of-mass frame would mean they are at rest. But wait, the problem states that in the center-of-mass system, the final particles are stationary. So, in that frame, the total energy is just the rest mass energy of the neutron and proton, \\( (m_n + m_p)c^2 \\). \n\nBut how does this relate to the energy in the lab frame? The problem mentions that \\( E^* \\), the energy of the incident photon in the center-of-mass system, is \\( (m_n + m_p)c^2 \\). Wait, that might be confusing. Let me parse that again. The deuteron's center-of-mass system would be the frame where the deuteron is at rest. But when the photon is incident on the deuteron, the combined system (photon + deuteron) would have a different center-of-mass frame. Maybe the problem is referring to the center-of-mass frame of the photon and deuteron system. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the invariant quantity \\( E^2 - p^2c^2 \\) is the same in all frames. The equation given is:\n\n\\[\n(E_\\gamma + Mc^2)^2 - (E_\\gamma/c)^2c^2 = (m_n + m_p)^2c^4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n\\[\n(E_\\gamma + Mc^2)^2 - E_\\gamma^2 = (m_n + m_p)^2c^4\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n\\[\nE_\\gamma^2 + 2E_\\gamma Mc^2 + M^2c^4 - E_\\gamma^2 = 2E_\\gamma Mc^2 + M^2c^4\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n2E_\\gamma Mc^2 + M^2c^4 = (m_n + m_p)^2c^4\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( M^2c^4 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2E_\\gamma Mc^2 = (m_n + m_p)^2c^4 - M^2c^4\n\\]\n\nFactor the right side as a difference of squares:\n\n\\[\n(m_n + m_p)^2 - M^2 = (m_n + m_p - M)(m_n + m_p + M)\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n2E_\\gamma Mc^2 = (m_n + m_p - M)(m_n + m_p + M)c^4\n\\]\n\nBut \\( B = (m_n + m_p - M)c^2 \\), so substituting that in:\n\n\\[\n2E_\\gamma Mc^2 = B \\cdot (m_n + m_p + M)c^2\n\\]\n\nBut \\( m_n + m_p = (M + B/c^2) \\), since \\( B = (m_n + m_p - M)c^2 \\). Wait, let's check:\n\nFrom \\( B = (m_n + m_p - M)c^2 \\), we can write \\( m_n + m_p = M + B/c^2 \\). Therefore, \\( m_n + m_p + M = 2M + B/c^2 \\). Hmm, substituting that into the equation:\n\n\\[\n2E_\\gamma Mc^2 = B \\cdot (2M + B/c^2)c^2\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[\nB \\cdot (2Mc^2 + B)\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n2E_\\gamma Mc^2 = 2Mc^2 B + B^2\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\( 2Mc^2 \\):\n\n\\[\nE_\\gamma = B + \\frac{B^2}{2Mc^2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\nE_\\gamma - B = \\frac{B^2}{2Mc^2}\n\\]\n\nWhich is the minimum value of \\( E_\\gamma - B \\). \n\nWait, but why is this the minimum value? Because at threshold, the photon's energy is just enough to provide the binding energy plus the necessary kinetic energy to conserve momentum. But in the threshold case, the products (n and p) are at rest in the center-of-mass frame. So, in that frame, the total energy is \\( (m_n + m_p)c^2 \\), and the invariant quantity squared is \\( (E_{total})^2 - (p_{total}c)^2 \\). Since in the center-of-mass frame, the momentum is zero, the invariant is just \\( (m_n + m_p)^2c^4 \\). \n\nIn the lab frame, where the deuteron is at rest and the photon has energy \\( E_\\gamma \\), the total energy is \\( E_\\gamma + Mc^2 \\), and the total momentum is \\( E_\\gamma / c \\) (since the photon's momentum is \\( E_\\gamma / c \\)). Therefore, the invariant squared is \\( (E_\\gamma + Mc^2)^2 - (E_\\gamma / c \\cdot c)^2 = (E_\\gamma + Mc^2)^2 - E_\\gamma^2 \\). Setting this equal to the invariant in the center-of-mass frame gives the equation they used. \n\nSo, solving that equation gives the threshold energy \\( E_\\gamma \\), and then subtracting the binding energy \\( B \\) gives the minimum value of \\( E_\\gamma - B \\), which is \\( B^2/(2Mc^2) \\). \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be \\( \\boxed{\\dfrac{B^2}{2Mc^2}} \\).\n</think>\n\nThe minimum value of \\( E_\\gamma - B \\) in the disintegration of the deuteron is derived by considering the Lorentz-invariant quantity \\( E^2 - p^2c^2 \\) in both the lab frame and the center-of-mass frame. At threshold, the final particles (neutron and proton) are stationary in the center-of-mass system, leading to the invariant equation:\n\n\\[\n(E_\\gamma + Mc^2)^2 - (E_\\gamma/c)^2c^2 = (m_n + m_p)^2c^4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n\\[\n2E_\\gamma Mc^2 + M^2c^4 = (m_n + m_p)^2c^4\n\\]\n\nUsing the binding energy \\( B = (m_n + m_p - M)c^2 \\), we substitute and factor the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n2E_\\gamma Mc^2 = (B + 2Mc^2)B\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( E_\\gamma \\):\n\n\\[\nE_\\gamma = B + \\frac{B^2}{2Mc^2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the minimum value of \\( E_\\gamma - B \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{B^2}{2Mc^2}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\dfrac{B^2}{2Mc^2}", "\\dfrac{B^2}{2Mc^2}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\dfrac{B^2}{2Mc^2}", "expr2": "E_\\gamma - B = \\frac{B^2}{2Mc^2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "B**2/(2*M*c**2)", "expr2": "B**2/(2*M*c**2)"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\dfrac{B^2}{2Mc^2}", "expr2": "E_\\gamma - B = \\frac{B^2}{2Mc^2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "B**2/(2*M*c**2)", "expr2": "B**2/(2*M*c**2)"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/4-8", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about determining the resolution needed to observe more than 50% of the decays of D^0 mesons. The given parameters are the mass of the D^0 meson (1.86 GeV), its decay products (K^+ and π^-), the lifetime τ = 5×10^-13 seconds, and the energy at which they're created, 18.6 GeV. The options are in millimeters, so the answer should be a length. \n\nFirst, I need to recall how particle decay lengths work. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. The formula for decay length L is L = γβcτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, β is v/c, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime. \n\nGiven that the particle is created with a certain energy, we can compute γ. The energy E of the particle is related to its mass m by E = γmc². So, γ = E/(mc²). Let's check the units here. The mass is given in GeV, and the energy is also in GeV. But c is in meters per second, so maybe we need to convert units appropriately. Wait, but in particle physics, often we use natural units where c=1, so maybe we can work in units where c=1 for simplicity. Let me think.\n\nIn natural units (c=1, ħ=1), energy, mass, and momentum are all in GeV. But time and distance are in inverse GeV. However, the lifetime is given in seconds, so we need to convert that into appropriate units. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute everything in SI units. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, compute the Lorentz factor γ. The total energy E is 18.6 GeV. The rest mass energy is mc² = 1.86 GeV. So γ = E/(mc²) = (18.6 GeV)/(1.86 GeV) = 10. So γ is 10. \n\nNext, β is v/c. Since γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²), we can solve for β. If γ = 10, then 1 - β² = 1/(γ²) = 1/100, so β² = 99/100, so β = sqrt(0.99) ≈ 0.994987. So β is approximately 0.995. \n\nNow, the decay length L is γβcτ. Let's compute each part. c is the speed of light, approximately 3×10^8 m/s. τ is 5×10^-13 seconds. So plugging in the numbers:\n\nL = γ * β * c * τ = 10 * 0.995 * 3×10^8 m/s * 5×10^-13 s.\n\nLet me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, 10 * 0.995 ≈ 9.95.\n\nThen, 9.95 * 3×10^8 = 9.95 * 3 = 29.85, so 29.85×10^8 m/s.\n\nMultiply by τ (5×10^-13 s): 29.85×10^8 * 5×10^-13 = (29.85 * 5) × 10^(8-13) = 149.25 × 10^-5 = 1.4925 × 10^-3 meters. \n\nConvert meters to millimeters: 1.4925 × 10^-3 meters = 1.4925 mm. \n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the resolution needed to observe more than 50% of the decays. Hmm. The decay length L is the average distance traveled. However, the probability of decay follows an exponential distribution. The number of particles remaining after time t is N(t) = N0 * e^(-t/γτ), since the lifetime is dilated by γ. The decay length is L = γβcτ, which is the average distance. \n\nBut the problem states \"observe more than 50% of the decays\". So we need to find the distance where the probability that the particle has decayed is more than 50%. Wait, but the average decay length is L = γβcτ. The mean path length is L. However, the actual decay positions follow an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle decays within a distance x is 1 - e^(-x/(γβcτ)). To have more than 50% of the decays observed, we need 1 - e^(-x/L) > 0.5. Solving for x:\n\n1 - e^(-x/L) > 0.5  \ne^(-x/L) < 0.5  \n-x/L < ln(0.5)  \nx > -L ln(0.5)  \nx > L ln(2) ≈ 0.693 L\n\nSo the distance needed to have 50% of the particles decay is approximately 0.693 times the average decay length. Wait, but the question is phrased as \"resolution needed to observe more than 50% of the decays\". Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. If the average decay length is L, then if the detector has a resolution better than L, you can observe the decay vertex. But perhaps the question is simply asking for the average decay length, and the answer is L. But according to the calculation above, L is approximately 1.49 mm. But the options are (a) 0.0011 mm, (b) 0.44 mm, (c) 2.2 mm. Hmm, 1.49 mm isn't one of the options. So maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's check the calculation again. Let's compute L step by step.\n\nGiven:\n\nγ = 10  \nβ ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = sqrt(1 - 1/100) = sqrt(99/100) = 0.994987  \n\nc = 3×10^8 m/s  \nτ = 5×10^-13 s  \n\nSo L = γ β c τ  \n= 10 * 0.994987 * 3×10^8 m/s * 5×10^-13 s  \nFirst, multiply 10 * 0.994987 ≈ 9.94987  \nThen, 9.94987 * 3×10^8 ≈ 29.8496×10^8  \nMultiply by 5×10^-13:  \n29.8496×10^8 * 5×10^-13 = (29.8496 * 5) × 10^(8-13)  \n= 149.248 × 10^-5  \n= 1.49248 × 10^-3 meters  \nConvert to millimeters: 1.49248 × 10^-3 m = 1.49248 mm ≈ 1.49 mm  \n\nBut the options don't have 1.49 mm. The closest option is (c) 2.2 mm. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, maybe the question is not asking for the average decay length but the actual distance such that 50% have decayed. Let's see. If the probability to decay within distance x is 50%, then x = L * ln(2). Wait, but earlier I thought that x = L * ln(2) ≈ 0.693 L. But if L is 1.49 mm, then 0.693 * 1.49 ≈ 1.03 mm. Still not matching the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the resolution refers to the spatial resolution of the detector. If the decay length is L, then the detector needs to have a resolution better than L to resolve the decay vertex. But if the average decay length is 1.49 mm, then the resolution needs to be smaller than that. But the options given are 0.0011, 0.44, 2.2 mm. So 0.44 mm is smaller than 1.49 mm. But why would the resolution need to be 0.44 mm? Maybe I miscalculated something.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of gamma. Let me check again. The energy given is 18.6 GeV, and the rest mass is 1.86 GeV. So gamma is E/(mc²). But in natural units where c=1, E = γ m. So γ = E/m = 18.6 / 1.86 = 10. That's correct. So gamma is 10. Then beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = sqrt(1 - 1/100) = sqrt(99/100) ≈ 0.994987. So that's correct. Then c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 5e-13 s. So the calculation seems right. \n\nWait, but maybe the lifetime given is the proper lifetime, so when calculating the lab frame lifetime, it's gamma*tau. Then the mean lifetime is gamma*tau. Then the mean path length is beta*c*gamma*tau. Which is the same as gamma*beta*c*tau. So that's what I did. So the average decay length is 1.49 mm. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is (c) 2.2 mm. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is not considering relativistic effects? Wait, that can't be. The energy is 18.6 GeV, rest mass 1.86 GeV, so gamma is 10. So relativistic effects are significant. If someone forgot to multiply by gamma, they would get L = beta*c*tau. Let's compute that. beta is ~0.995, c*tau = 3e8 m/s * 5e-13 s = 1.5e-5 m = 0.015 mm. Then times beta ~0.015 mm. That's 0.015 mm, which is much smaller than the options. So that's not it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the mean lifetime gamma*tau, and then the length is beta*c*(gamma*tau). Which is the same as gamma*beta*c*tau. So same as before. So 1.49 mm. Hmm. The options are (c) 2.2 mm. Maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nWait, 10 * 0.995 is 9.95. 9.95 * 3e8 = 29.85e8 m/s. Then 29.85e8 m/s * 5e-13 s = 29.85e8 *5e-13 = 149.25e-5 m = 1.4925e-3 m = 1.4925 mm. Yes, that's correct. So 1.49 mm. But the options don't have that. The closest is (c) 2.2 mm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, maybe the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total energy? If that's the case, then gamma would be different. Let's check.\n\nIf the energy given is kinetic energy (K), then total energy E = K + mc². But the problem states \"created with 18.6 GeV energy\", which is likely the total energy. But if it's kinetic energy, then E = K + m = 18.6 GeV + 1.86 GeV = 20.46 GeV. Then gamma = E/mc² = 20.46 / 1.86 ≈ 11. So gamma would be 11. Then beta would be sqrt(1 - 1/121) ≈ sqrt(120/121) ≈ 0.9958. Then L = 11 * 0.9958 * 3e8 *5e-13. Let's compute that:\n\n11 * 0.9958 ≈ 10.9538  \n10.9538 *3e8 = 32.8614e8  \n32.8614e8 *5e-13 = 164.307e-5 = 1.64307e-3 m = 1.643 mm. Still not 2.2 mm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the lifetime is given in the lab frame? No, the lifetime tau is the proper lifetime. So the lab frame lifetime is gamma*tau. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using beta gamma instead of gamma beta? Wait, beta gamma is another term. Let's see. The decay length is c*tau*beta*gamma. Which is the same as what I did. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the mean proper lifetime, but I think that's accounted for. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the proper length, but that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the calculation is correct, but the answer is not among the options. But the options are (a) 0.0011, (b) 0.44, (c) 2.2. Hmm. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in unit conversions. Let me check the calculation again with precise numbers.\n\nCompute L = gamma * beta * c * tau.\n\ngamma = 10.\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - (1/10)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.01) = sqrt(0.99) ≈ 0.9949874371.\n\nc = 299,792,458 m/s (exact value), but approx 3e8 m/s.\n\ntau = 5e-13 s.\n\nSo L = 10 * 0.9949874371 * 3e8 m/s * 5e-13 s.\n\nFirst, multiply 10 * 0.9949874371 = 9.949874371.\n\nThen multiply by 3e8: 9.949874371 * 3e8 = 2.984962311e9.\n\nThen multiply by 5e-13: 2.984962311e9 *5e-13 = 1.492481155e-3 meters.\n\nConvert to millimeters: 1.492481155e-3 m = 1.492481155 mm ≈ 1.49 mm.\n\nStill getting 1.49 mm. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the answer is (c) 2.2 mm. But why? Maybe the question is considering the lab frame lifetime as gamma*tau, and then the length is beta*c*gamma*tau. Which is what I did. So that's correct. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is using a different value for c? For example, sometimes c is taken as 3e8 m/s approximately, but maybe the precise calculation is needed. Let's try with c = 2.9979e8 m/s.\n\nCompute L = 10 * 0.9949874371 * 2.9979e8 *5e-13.\n\nFirst, 10 * 0.9949874371 = 9.949874371.\n\nMultiply by 2.9979e8: 9.949874371 *2.9979e8 ≈ 9.949874371 *3e8 = 2.98496e9, but precise:\n\n2.9979e8 = 299,790,000.\n\nSo 9.949874371 * 299,790,000 ≈ 9.949874371 * 3e8 = 2.98496e9, but exact:\n\n299,790,000 * 9.949874371 ≈ ?\n\nLet me compute 299,790,000 * 9 = 2,698,110,000  \n299,790,000 * 0.949874371 ≈ ?\n\n0.949874371 * 299,790,000 ≈ 299,790,000 * 0.9 = 269,811,000  \n299,790,000 * 0.049874371 ≈ 299,790,000 *0.05=14,989,500, subtract the extra 0.000125629*299,790,000 ≈ 299,790,000 *0.000125629≈37,700. So total ≈ 269,811,000 +14,989,500 -37,700 ≈ 284,762,800.\n\nSo total ≈ 2,698,110,000 + 284,762,800 ≈ 2,982,872,800 ≈ 2.9828728e9.\n\nThen multiply by 5e-13: 2.9828728e9 *5e-13 = 1.4914364e-3 meters ≈ 1.491 mm. Still about 1.49 mm. So no, even with precise c, it's still ~1.49 mm. \n\nBut the options are 0.0011, 0.44, 2.2. So none of these. But the closest is (c) 2.2 mm. Hmm. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's numbers? Or perhaps I misunderstood the question. \n\nWait, the question says \"resolution needed to observe more than 50% of the decays\". Maybe the resolution refers to the ability to distinguish the decay vertex from the production vertex. If the average decay length is L, then the uncertainty in measuring L should be smaller than L to observe it. But that's not exactly the same as the decay length. For example, if the decay length is 1.49 mm, then the resolution needs to be better than that to resolve the separation between production and decay points. But the options don't have 1.49 mm. The closest is (c) 2.2 mm. But 2.2 mm is larger than 1.49 mm, so if the resolution is 2.2 mm, you might not be able to see the decay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the distance such that 50% of the decays occur within that distance, which would be L * ln(2). Let's compute that. \n\nL = 1.49 mm. Then L * ln(2) ≈ 1.49 * 0.693 ≈ 1.03 mm. Still not matching the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the relativistic speed as beta*c, and then computes the distance as beta*c*tau, without considering gamma. But that would be non-relativistic. Let's see:\n\nbeta = v/c ≈ sqrt(1 - (m^2c^4)/(E^2)) = sqrt(1 - (1.86^2)/(18.6^2)) = sqrt(1 - (3.4596)/(345.96)) = sqrt(1 - 0.01) = sqrt(0.99) ≈ 0.995. So beta*c is approximately 0.995*3e8 m/s. Then distance is beta*c*tau = 0.995*3e8*5e-13 = 0.995*1.5e-5 = 1.4925e-5 meters = 0.014925 mm. That's 0.015 mm, which is option (a) 0.0011 mm is even smaller. So that's not it. \n\nWait, but if someone forgot to multiply by gamma, they would get 0.015 mm, which is not an option. So that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the lifetime in the lab frame, which is gamma*tau, and then multiplies by velocity v = beta*c. So L = v * t = beta*c * gamma*tau = beta*gamma*c*tau. Which is the same as before. So that's correct. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using the total energy as gamma*m*c^2, but maybe the person forgot that the rest mass is 1.86 GeV/c². Wait, but in natural units, mass is in GeV/c², so when you compute gamma, E = gamma*m*c². But if the energy is given in GeV, and mass is in GeV/c², then E (GeV) = gamma * m (GeV/c²) * c². So gamma = E/(m c²) * c². Wait, no. Let's clarify units. \n\nIf the rest mass m is 1.86 GeV/c², and the total energy E is 18.6 GeV, then gamma is E/(m c²) * c². Wait, no. In natural units where c=1, E (GeV) = gamma*m (GeV). So gamma = E/m = 18.6 /1.86 =10. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the lab frame lifetime as tau, but that's not the case. The proper lifetime is tau, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma*tau. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck. According to my calculation, the average decay length is approximately 1.49 mm, but the options don't include that. The closest is (c) 2.2 mm. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's numbers, or perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check once more.\n\nWait, maybe the energy given is the momentum? No, the problem says \"created with 18.6 GeV energy\". So energy is total energy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the lifetime is given in the lab frame. If tau is the lab frame lifetime, then the proper lifetime is tau/gamma. But the problem states \"decay by D^0 → K^+ + π^- in τ = 5×10^-13 sec\". That τ is the proper lifetime. Because the lifetime given for particles is always the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the rest frame). So the lab frame lifetime is gamma*tau. \n\nSo the calculation is correct. Then why is the answer not among the options? Maybe the options are wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the proper length, but that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using beta without gamma. Wait, no. The decay length is gamma*beta*c*tau. \n\nWait, let's try to compute gamma*beta. For gamma=10, beta=0.995. So gamma*beta=10*0.995=9.95. Then c*tau=3e8 m/s *5e-13 s=1.5e-5 m=0.015 mm. Then gamma*beta*c*tau=9.95*0.015 mm≈0.14925 mm. Wait, that's 0.149 mm, which is approximately 0.15 mm. But option (b) is 0.44 mm. Not matching. \n\nWait, this is confusing. If I compute gamma*beta as 9.95, and c*tau as 0.015 mm, then 9.95*0.015 mm=0.14925 mm. But that's not matching my previous result. Wait, no, because c*tau is 3e8 m/s *5e-13 s=1.5e-5 m=0.015 mm. Then gamma*beta*c*tau=9.95*0.015 mm=0.14925 mm. But this contradicts the earlier calculation. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, no. Wait, c*tau is 3e8 m/s *5e-13 s=1.5e-5 meters=0.015 meters? No, 1.5e-5 meters is 0.015 mm. Because 1 meter is 1000 mm. So 1.5e-5 m *1000 mm/m=0.015 mm. Then gamma*beta is 9.95. So 9.95 *0.015 mm=0.14925 mm≈0.15 mm. But this is different from the previous calculation where I got 1.49 mm. What's the discrepancy?\n\nWait, no. Wait, 3e8 m/s *5e-13 s=1.5e-5 meters=0.015 meters? No, 3e8 m/s *5e-13 s= (3*5)e(8-13) =15e-5 meters=0.00015 meters=0.15 millimeters. Wait, 15e-5 meters is 0.00015 meters, which is 0.15 mm. Then gamma*beta is 9.95. So 9.95*0.15 mm=1.4925 mm. Ah, yes! I think I made a mistake in the previous step when converting meters to millimeters. Let me recheck:\n\nc*tau =3e8 m/s *5e-13 s=1.5e-5 meters. Convert to millimeters: 1.5e-5 m *1000 mm/m=0.015 mm. Then multiply by gamma*beta=9.95: 0.015 mm *9.95=0.14925 mm. Wait, this contradicts the earlier result. Wait, no. Wait, 3e8 m/s *5e-13 s= (3*5)*10^(8-13)=15*10^-5 meters=0.00015 meters=0.15 millimeters. Then multiply by gamma*beta=9.95: 0.15 mm *9.95≈1.4925 mm. Yes, that's correct. So earlier mistake was in the intermediate step of converting c*tau to millimeters. So the correct calculation is:\n\nc*tau =3e8 *5e-13=1.5e-4 meters? Wait, no. Wait, 3e8 m/s *5e-13 s= (3*5)e(8-13)=15e-5 m=0.00015 m=0.15 mm. Then multiply by gamma*beta=9.95: 0.15 mm *9.95≈1.49 mm. Yes. So the correct average decay length is approximately 1.49 mm. \n\nBut the options are (a) 0.0011 mm, (b) 0.44 mm, (c) 2.2 mm. So none of these. But the problem must have one of these as the correct answer. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the lab frame lifetime multiplied by the speed, but that's the same as the decay length. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the relativistic gamma as E/mc² where E is kinetic energy. Let's check that. If the energy given is kinetic energy K=18.6 GeV, then total energy E=K + mc²=18.6 +1.86=20.46 GeV. Then gamma=E/mc²=20.46/1.86≈11. So gamma=11. Then beta=sqrt(1-1/121)=sqrt(120/121)=approx 0.9958. Then decay length L=11*0.9958*3e8*5e-13. Let's compute:\n\n11*0.9958=10.9538  \n10.9538*3e8=32.8614e8  \n32.8614e8*5e-13=164.307e-5=0.00164307 meters=1.64307 mm. Still not matching the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy is the momentum? If the energy is actually the momentum p, then E= sqrt(p²c² + m²c^4)/c². But in natural units, if p=18.6 GeV/c, then E= sqrt(p²c² + m²c^4)/c²= sqrt( (18.6)^2 + (1.86)^2 ) GeV. So E= sqrt(345.96 +3.4596)=sqrt(349.4196)=18.69 GeV. Then gamma=E/m=18.69/1.86≈10.05. So similar to before. Decay length would be roughly the same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses a different formula. For example, if the particle's speed is v=beta*c, then time dilation means the lifetime is gamma*tau. The distance is v*gamma*tau=beta*c*gamma*tau=gamma*beta*c*tau. Which is the same as before. \n\nI think my calculation is correct, but the answer isn't among the options. However, the closest option is (c) 2.2 mm. Maybe there's a rounding difference or a miscalculation in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for twice the decay length or something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the lab frame lifetime as tau, and the proper lifetime is tau/gamma. But that would be incorrect. If the given tau is the lab frame lifetime, then the proper lifetime is tau/gamma. Then the decay length would be beta*c*tau. Let's see:\n\nIf tau here is the lab frame lifetime (gamma*tau_proper), then decay length L=beta*c*tau_lab=beta*c*(gamma tau_proper)=beta*gamma*c*tau_proper, which is the same as before. So no difference. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a different approach. For example, the mean free path or something else. But I don't think so. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the uncertainty in position measurement needed to resolve the decay length. For example, if the decay length is L, the resolution delta_x must be less than L to observe the decay. But if L is 1.49 mm, then the resolution needs to be better than that. The options are (a) 0.0011, (b) 0.44, (c) 2.2. So if the resolution is 0.44 mm, which is better than 1.49 mm, then you can observe the decay. But why would the answer be 0.44 mm? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the proper length, but that's the length in the rest frame, which is zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using non-relativistic mechanics. Let's try that. \n\nNon-relativistic speed: Kinetic energy K= (1/2)mv². Given K=18.6 GeV, m=1.86 GeV/c². \n\nBut in non-relativistic terms, K= (1/2)mv². So v= sqrt(2K/m). \n\nBut units are tricky. Let's convert to SI units. \n\nBut maybe in natural units where c=1, K=18.6 GeV - m=1.86 GeV. But non-relativistic kinetic energy is K= (1/2)mv². So v= sqrt(2K/m). \n\nBut K=18.6 GeV - m=1.86 GeV=16.74 GeV. Wait, but that's not correct. The total energy is gamma*mc². If we're using non-relativistic, then K= (1/2)mv². But given that the energy is 18.6 GeV, which is much larger than the rest mass, so non-relativistic is not applicable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using velocity v= sqrt(2K/m). But that's non-relativistic. Let's compute that. \n\nK=18.6 GeV - 1.86 GeV=16.74 GeV. \n\nv= sqrt(2K/m) = sqrt(2*16.74 /1.86) *c. \n\nCompute 2*16.74 /1.86=33.48/1.86≈18. So v= sqrt(18)*c≈4.24c. Which is impossible. So non-relativistic approach is invalid. \n\nThus, I think my initial calculation is correct, and the answer should be approximately 1.5 mm, but since it's not an option, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. However, given the options, the closest is (c) 2.2 mm. But why? Maybe the problem used gamma=18.6/1.86=10, but then multiplied by c*tau=0.15 mm, and then multiplied by gamma=10, getting 1.5 mm, but perhaps there's a factor of 1.5 somewhere. Alternatively, maybe the problem used a different value for c, like 3e10 cm/s? Wait, no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the lifetime in the lab frame as tau, and the proper lifetime is tau/gamma. Then the decay length would be beta*c*tau. Let's see:\n\nIf the given tau is the lab frame lifetime (which is gamma*tau_proper), then decay length L=beta*c*tau_lab=beta*c*gamma*tau_proper=gamma*beta*c*tau_proper, which is the same as before. So no difference. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using beta=1. So L=gamma*c*tau. Let's compute that:\n\ngamma=10, c=3e8 m/s, tau=5e-13 s.\n\nL=10*3e8*5e-13=1.5e-4 m=0.15 mm. Which is option (b) 0.44 mm is larger. Not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using beta=1 and gamma=10, so L=10*3e8*5e-13=1.5e-4 m=0.15 mm. Still not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the total energy as gamma*m, but m is in GeV/c². So E=gamma*m*c². But if the units are mixed, perhaps there's a missing c^2. But in natural units, c=1, so E=gamma*m. \n\nI'm really stuck. According to my calculations, the correct answer is approximately 1.49 mm, which is not listed. The options are (a) 0.0011, (b) 0.44, (c) 2.2. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is (c) 2.2 mm, assuming a calculation mistake in gamma. For example, if gamma was calculated as E/m=18.6/1.86=10, but maybe they used gamma=18.6/1.86=10, but then multiplied by something else. Alternatively, maybe they forgot to convert seconds to some other unit. Let's check the units again. \n\nTau is given in seconds. c is in m/s. So c*tau is meters. Let's compute c*tau:\n\nc=3e8 m/s  \ntau=5e-13 s  \nc*tau=3e8 *5e-13=1.5e-5 m=0.015 meters=15 mm. Wait, wait! Wait a minute. 3e8 m/s *5e-13 s=1.5e-5 meters=0.015 meters=15 millimeters. Oh my God! I think I made a mistake in converting meters to millimeters. \n\nWait, 1.5e-5 meters is 0.000015 meters. Since 1 meter=1000 millimeters, so 0.000015 meters *1000 mm/m=0.015 mm. But wait, 3e8 m/s *5e-13 s= (3*5)e(8-13)=15e-5 m=0.00015 m=0.15 mm. Wait, no. 3e8 *5e-13=1.5e-4 m=0.00015 m=0.15 mm. Yes. So c*tau=0.15 mm. Then gamma*beta=9.95. So L=9.95*0.15 mm≈1.49 mm. \n\nBut if someone mistakenly calculated c*tau as 3e8 *5e-13=1.5e-5 m=0.015 m=15 mm, then multiplied by gamma*beta=9.95, they would get 15 mm *9.95≈149.25 mm=14.9 cm. Which is way off. But that's not the case here. \n\nWait, but perhaps the problem used c=3e10 cm/s instead of m/s. Let's check. If c=3e10 cm/s, then c*tau=3e10 cm/s *5e-13 s=1.5e-2 cm=0.15 mm. Same as before. So no difference. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem used c=3e8 m/s and tau=5e-13 s, but forgot to convert seconds to another unit. No, the units are correct. \n\nI think the calculation is correct, and the answer should be approximately 1.5 mm, but since it's not an option, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. However, given the options, the closest is (c) 2.2 mm. But why? Maybe the problem intended to use gamma=18.6/1.86=10, but then multiplied by something else. Alternatively, maybe the lifetime is given in the lab frame, and the proper lifetime is tau/gamma. But then the decay length would be beta*c*tau_lab=beta*c*(gamma tau_proper)=gamma*beta*c*tau_proper, which is the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the formula L= c*tau, which would be 3e8 m/s *5e-13 s=1.5e-5 m=0.015 mm. Which is option (a) 0.0011 mm. Not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the formula L= gamma*c*tau. Let's compute that: gamma=10, c*tau=0.15 mm. So L=10*0.15=1.5 mm. Still not an option. \n\nGiven that, I think there's a mistake in the problem's options. However, since the closest option is (c) 2.2 mm, but my calculation gives 1.49 mm, which is not listed, I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the relativistic speed as beta=1, leading to L=gamma*c*tau=10*3e8*5e-13=1.5e-4 m=0.15 mm, which is", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0}
{"id": "atomic/2-25", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The question is asking to explain the various terms in the nuclear binding energy formula. The formula given is:\n\nB.E. = a₁A - a₂A²/³ - a₃Z²A⁻¹/³ - a₄(A - 2Z)²A⁻¹\n\nHmm, I remember that the binding energy formula comes from the liquid drop model. Each term corresponds to a different contribution to the binding energy. Let me recall each term's physical meaning.\n\nThe first term, a₁A, should be the volume term. Since nuclear forces are short-ranged, each nucleon interacts with its nearest neighbors, so the binding energy is proportional to the number of nucleons, A. This term contributes positively, increasing the binding energy.\n\nThe second term is -a₂A²/³. That's the surface term. Nucleons on the surface of the nucleus have fewer neighbors, so their binding is less. This term subtracts energy because surface nucleons contribute less. The surface area is proportional to the radius squared, and since radius R ~ A¹/³, the surface area is ~ A²/³. Hence, the surface term is negative and proportional to A²/³.\n\nThird term: -a₃Z²A⁻¹/³. That's the Coulomb term. Protons repel each other due to Coulomb forces, which reduces the binding energy. The Coulomb energy for a uniformly charged sphere is proportional to Z²/R. Since R = R₀A¹/³, substituting gives Z²/A¹/³. Hence, this term is negative and proportional to Z²A⁻¹/³.\n\nFourth term: -a₄(A - 2Z)²A⁻¹. This must be the asymmetry term, which accounts for the Pauli exclusion principle. In a nucleus with unequal numbers of protons and neutrons (N ≠ Z), the extra neutrons (or protons) have to occupy higher energy levels, reducing the binding energy. The asymmetry term is proportional to (N - Z)²/A. Since N = A - Z, (N - Z) = A - 2Z. So, (A - 2Z)²/A. Hence, the term is negative and proportional to (A - 2Z)²/A⁻¹? Wait, the formula has A⁻¹. Let me check. If (A - 2Z)²/A, then that's (A - 2Z)² multiplied by 1/A. So the term is -a₄*(A - 2Z)²/A. So yes, that's the asymmetry term.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\n- a₁A: Volume term (positive)\n- -a₂A²/³: Surface term (negative)\n- -a₃Z²A⁻¹/³: Coulomb repulsion (negative)\n- -a₄(A - 2Z)²/A: Asymmetry term (negative)\n\nI think that's right. Maybe also mention pairing term? Wait, the given formula doesn't have a pairing term. The standard Bethe-Weizsäcker formula includes a pairing term like ±δ/A¹/², but maybe in this empirical expression, they omitted it. So the four terms here are volume, surface, Coulomb, and asymmetry.\n\nMoving to part (b): Considering a set of isobaric nuclei (same A), derive a relationship between A and Z for naturally occurring nuclei.\n\nIsobaric nuclei have the same mass number A. For naturally occurring nuclei, they should be stable, so they lie along the valley of stability. To find the relationship between Z and A, we need to minimize the binding energy with respect to Z for a given A, since maximum binding energy corresponds to maximum stability.\n\nSo take the binding energy expression, set A constant, and take derivative of B.E. with respect to Z, set to zero.\n\nGiven B.E. = a₁A - a₂A²/³ - a₃Z²A⁻¹/³ - a₄(A - 2Z)²A⁻¹\n\nFor fixed A, we can write B.E. as a function of Z. Let's compute dB.E./dZ and set to zero.\n\nCompute derivative term by term:\n\nd/dZ [a₁A] = 0\n\nd/dZ [-a₂A²/³] = 0\n\nd/dZ [-a₃Z²A⁻¹/³] = -a₃ * 2Z * A⁻¹/³\n\nd/dZ [-a₄(A - 2Z)²/A] = -a₄/A * 2(A - 2Z)(-2) = (4a₄/A)(A - 2Z)\n\nSet the sum to zero:\n\n-2a₃Z A⁻¹/³ + (4a₄/A)(A - 2Z) = 0\n\nMultiply through by A to eliminate denominators:\n\n-2a₃Z A²/³ + 4a₄(A - 2Z) = 0\n\nLet me check the algebra again. Wait, original derivative terms:\n\nFirst term: -a₃ * 2Z * A⁻¹/³\n\nSecond term: -a₄/A * 2(A - 2Z)(-2) = (4a₄/A)(A - 2Z)\n\nSo combining:\n\n-2a₃ Z A⁻¹/³ + (4a₄/A)(A - 2Z) = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by A:\n\n-2a₃ Z A²/³ + 4a₄ (A - 2Z) = 0\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n4a₄(A - 2Z) = 2a₃ Z A²/³\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n2a₄(A - 2Z) = a₃ Z A²/³\n\nLet's solve for Z:\n\n2a₄A - 4a₄Z = a₃ Z A²/³\n\nBring terms with Z to one side:\n\n2a₄A = Z (a₃ A²/³ + 4a₄)\n\nThus,\n\nZ = (2a₄A) / (a₃ A²/³ + 4a₄)\n\nHmm, but this seems a bit complicated. Let's factor out A²/³ from denominator:\n\nZ = (2a₄A) / [A²/³ (a₃ + 4a₄ A^{-1/3}) ]\n\nThen,\n\nZ = 2a₄ A^{1 - 2/3} / (a₃ + 4a₄ A^{-1/3})\n\nSimplify exponent: 1 - 2/3 = 1/3\n\nSo,\n\nZ = 2a₄ A^{1/3} / [a₃ + 4a₄ A^{-1/3} ]\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by A^{1/3} to eliminate the A^{-1/3} in the denominator:\n\nZ = 2a₄ A^{1/3} * A^{1/3} / [a₃ A^{1/3} + 4a₄ ]\n\nSo,\n\nZ = 2a₄ A^{2/3} / [a₃ A^{1/3} + 4a₄ ]\n\nAlternatively, factor out A^{1/3} in denominator:\n\nZ = 2a₄ A^{2/3} / [A^{1/3}(a₃ + 4a₄ A^{-1/3} ) ]\n\nWait, this seems messy. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps we can approximate if certain terms dominate. For heavy nuclei, A is large, so A^{2/3} is significant. Let's see.\n\nBut maybe the standard semi-empirical mass formula gives Z ≈ (A)/(2 + (a₃/(2a₄)) A²/³ )\n\nWait, I recall that the valley of stability is approximately Z ≈ A/(2 + 0.015 A²/³). So maybe the relation here would be similar.\n\nLooking back at the equation:\n\n2a₄(A - 2Z) = a₃ Z A²/³\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n2a₄A - 4a₄Z = a₃ Z A²/³\n\nBring all terms with Z to one side:\n\n2a₄A = Z (a₃ A²/³ + 4a₄)\n\nTherefore,\n\nZ = (2a₄ A) / (a₃ A²/³ + 4a₄ )\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2a₄:\n\nZ = A / [ (a₃/(2a₄)) A²/³ + 2 ]\n\nSo,\n\nZ = A / [ 2 + (a₃/(2a₄)) A²/³ ]\n\nWhich is similar to the standard formula Z = A / (2 + c A²/³ ), where c is a constant involving the ratio a₃/a₄.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between Z and A is:\n\nZ ≈ A / [ 2 + (a₃/(2a₄)) A^{2/3} ]\n\nThis is the condition for the most stable isobar, so naturally occurring nuclei should follow this Z as a function of A.\n\nFor part (c): Use a Fermi gas model to estimate the magnitude of a₄. Assume A ≠ 2Z and R = R₀ A¹/³.\n\nThe asymmetry term in the binding energy comes from the Pauli exclusion principle. In the Fermi gas model, protons and neutrons are treated as two separate Fermi gases. If the numbers of protons and neutrons are unequal, the Fermi energies will be different, leading to a higher total energy (lower binding energy).\n\nThe asymmetry term is proportional to (N - Z)²/A. Let's recall that in the Fermi gas model, the kinetic energy per nucleon is proportional to the Fermi energy, which is proportional to (n)^{2/3}, where n is the number density.\n\nFor a nucleus with N neutrons and Z protons, the total kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic energies of the neutron and proton gases.\n\nAssuming the nucleus is a sphere of volume V = (4/3)πR³ = (4/3)πR₀³ A. So the number densities are n_n = N/V and n_p = Z/V.\n\nThe Fermi momentum for each is p_F = ħ(3π² n)^{1/3}\n\nThe Fermi energy is E_F = p_F²/(2m) = (ħ²/(2m))(3π² n)^{2/3}\n\nThe total kinetic energy is then for neutrons: (3/5) E_F,n * N and similarly for protons: (3/5) E_F,p * Z\n\nSo total kinetic energy T = (3/5)(E_F,n N + E_F,p Z)\n\nIf N = Z = A/2 (symmetric nucleus), then n_n = n_p = (A/2)/V = (A)/(2V) = (A)/(2*(4/3 π R₀³ A)) ) = 3/(8 π R₀³ )\n\nSo n = 3/(8 π R₀³ ) for both protons and neutrons.\n\nIn this case, E_F,n = E_F,p = (ħ²/(2m))(3π² n)^{2/3}\n\nBut if N ≠ Z, then n_n = N/V, n_p = Z/V. Let’s define the asymmetry as (N - Z)/A = (A - 2Z)/A. Let’s let δ = (N - Z)/A = (A - 2Z)/A. Then N = Z + δA. Since A = N + Z, substituting gives N = Z + δA and Z = (A - N). Wait, maybe better to express in terms of δ.\n\nBut perhaps we can expand the kinetic energy for small δ. Let’s assume that the asymmetry is small, so δ = (N - Z)/A is small. Then N ≈ Z ≈ A/2. Let’s set N = A/2 + Δ, Z = A/2 - Δ. Then δ = (N - Z)/A = (2Δ)/A. So Δ = δA/2.\n\nThe total kinetic energy would be:\n\nT = (3/5) [ E_F,n (A/2 + Δ) + E_F,p (A/2 - Δ) ]\n\nWe can expand E_F,n and E_F,p around the symmetric case (Δ = 0).\n\nFirst, compute E_F,n and E_F,p in terms of Δ.\n\nThe neutron density is n_n = (A/2 + Δ)/V = (A/2 + Δ)/( (4/3)π R₀³ A ) ) = [ (A/2 + Δ) / A ] * 3/(4 π R₀³ )\n\nSimilarly, n_p = (A/2 - Δ)/V = [ (A/2 - Δ)/A ] * 3/(4 π R₀³ )\n\nLet’s define the symmetric density n₀ = (A/2)/V = (A/2)/( (4/3)π R₀³ A ) ) = 3/(8 π R₀³ )\n\nSo n_n = n₀ (1 + 2Δ/A )\n\nSimilarly, n_p = n₀ (1 - 2Δ/A )\n\nThen, E_F,n = (ħ²/(2m))(3π² n_n )^{2/3} = (ħ²/(2m))(3π² n₀ (1 + 2Δ/A ))^{2/3} ≈ E_F0 [1 + (2Δ/A) * (2/3) ]\n\nSimilarly for E_F,p ≈ E_F0 [1 - (2Δ/A) * (2/3) ]\n\nWhere E_F0 is the Fermi energy in the symmetric case.\n\nSo expanding to first order in Δ/A:\n\nE_F,n ≈ E_F0 (1 + (4/3)(Δ/A) )\n\nE_F,p ≈ E_F0 (1 - (4/3)(Δ/A) )\n\nThen, substitute into T:\n\nT ≈ (3/5) [ E_F0 (1 + (4/3)(Δ/A) ) (A/2 + Δ) + E_F0 (1 - (4/3)(Δ/A) ) (A/2 - Δ) ]\n\nLet’s factor out E_F0 and 3/5:\n\nT ≈ (3/5) E_F0 [ (1 + (4Δ)/(3A))(A/2 + Δ) + (1 - (4Δ)/(3A))(A/2 - Δ) ]\n\nExpand each term:\n\nFirst term: (1)(A/2 + Δ) + (4Δ/(3A))(A/2 + Δ)\n\n= A/2 + Δ + (4Δ/(3A))(A/2) + (4Δ/(3A))(Δ)\n\n= A/2 + Δ + (4Δ/3 * 1/2) + (4Δ²)/(3A)\n\n= A/2 + Δ + (2Δ/3) + (4Δ²)/(3A)\n\nSimilarly, second term: (1)(A/2 - Δ) - (4Δ/(3A))(A/2 - Δ)\n\n= A/2 - Δ - (4Δ/(3A))(A/2) + (4Δ/(3A))(Δ)\n\n= A/2 - Δ - (4Δ/3 * 1/2) + (4Δ²)/(3A)\n\n= A/2 - Δ - (2Δ/3) + (4Δ²)/(3A)\n\nNow add the two terms:\n\nFirst term + Second term:\n\n[A/2 + Δ + 2Δ/3 + 4Δ²/(3A)] + [A/2 - Δ - 2Δ/3 + 4Δ²/(3A)]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nA/2 + A/2 = A\n\nΔ - Δ = 0\n\n2Δ/3 - 2Δ/3 = 0\n\n4Δ²/(3A) + 4Δ²/(3A) = 8Δ²/(3A)\n\nSo total:\n\nA + 8Δ²/(3A)\n\nTherefore, T ≈ (3/5) E_F0 [ A + (8Δ²)/(3A) ]\n\nThe first term is the kinetic energy in the symmetric case, and the second term is the correction due to asymmetry.\n\nThe symmetric kinetic energy is T_sym = (3/5) E_F0 A\n\nThe asymmetry correction is ΔT = (3/5) E_F0 * (8Δ²)/(3A) ) = (8/5) E_F0 Δ² / A\n\nBut Δ = (N - Z)/2 = (A - 2Z)/2. Wait, earlier we defined δ = (N - Z)/A = (A - 2Z)/A. So Δ = δA/2. Therefore, Δ² = (δ² A²)/4\n\nSubstitute into ΔT:\n\nΔT = (8/5) E_F0 * (δ² A² /4 ) / A = (8/5) E_F0 * δ² A /4 = (2/5) E_F0 δ² A\n\nBut δ = (A - 2Z)/A, so δ² = (A - 2Z)² / A²\n\nThus, ΔT = (2/5) E_F0 * (A - 2Z)² / A² * A = (2/5) E_F0 (A - 2Z)² / A\n\nTherefore, the asymmetry term in the binding energy is -ΔT, since higher kinetic energy reduces binding energy. So:\n\nB.E. asymmetry term = - (2/5) E_F0 (A - 2Z)² / A\n\nComparing this to the given expression in the binding energy formula: -a₄ (A - 2Z)² A⁻¹\n\nTherefore, equate:\n\n- a₄ (A - 2Z)² / A = - (2/5) E_F0 (A - 2Z)² / A\n\nThus, a₄ = (2/5) E_F0\n\nNow, we need to compute E_F0, the Fermi energy in the symmetric case.\n\nIn the symmetric case, n₀ = 3/(8 π R₀³ )\n\nThe Fermi momentum p_F = ħ (3π² n₀ )^{1/3}\n\nE_F0 = p_F²/(2m) = (ħ²/(2m)) (3π² n₀ )^{2/3}\n\nSubstitute n₀ = 3/(8 π R₀³ )\n\nSo:\n\n3π² n₀ = 3π² * 3/(8 π R₀³ ) = (9 π²)/(8 π R₀³ ) = (9 π)/(8 R₀³ )\n\nThus,\n\nE_F0 = (ħ²/(2m)) * (9 π / (8 R₀³ ))^{2/3}\n\nSimplify the exponent:\n\n(9 π /8 )^{2/3} / R₀²\n\nSo,\n\nE_F0 = (ħ²/(2m)) * (9 π /8 )^{2/3} / R₀²\n\nCompute (9 π /8 )^{2/3}:\n\nFirst, 9 = 3², 8 = 2³. So:\n\n(9 π /8 ) = (3² π ) / 2³\n\nTake natural log: ln( (3² π)/2³ ) = 2 ln3 + lnπ - 3 ln2\n\nBut maybe better to compute numerically:\n\n9 π ≈ 28.274\n\n28.274 /8 ≈ 3.534\n\n3.534^(2/3) ≈ e^( (2/3) ln3.534 )\n\nln3.534 ≈ 1.262\n\n(2/3)*1.262 ≈ 0.841\n\ne^0.841 ≈ 2.32\n\nAlternatively, exact expression:\n\n(9π/8)^{2/3} = (9/8)^{2/3} (π)^{2/3}\n\n(9/8) = (3^2)/(2^3), so (9/8)^{2/3} = (3^4/2^6)^{1/3} = 3^(4/3)/2^2 = 3^(1 + 1/3)/4 = 3 * 3^{1/3}/4 ≈ 3 * 1.442 /4 ≈ 4.326/4 ≈ 1.0815\n\n(π)^{2/3} ≈ (3.1416)^{2/3} ≈ 2.145\n\nMultiply together: 1.0815 * 2.145 ≈ 2.32\n\nSo approximately 2.32.\n\nThus,\n\nE_F0 ≈ (ħ²/(2m)) * 2.32 / R₀²\n\nBut R₀ is the nuclear radius constant, approximately 1.2 fm = 1.2e-15 m.\n\nBut let's keep R₀ as a symbol for now.\n\nTherefore,\n\na₄ = (2/5) E_F0 ≈ (2/5) * (ħ²/(2m)) * (9π/8)^{2/3} / R₀²\n\nSimplify:\n\na₄ ≈ (ħ²/(5m)) * (9π/8)^{2/3} / R₀²\n\nBut we can plug in constants.\n\nCompute numerical value:\n\nħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s\n\nm = 938.272 MeV/c² ≈ 1.6726e-27 kg (proton mass)\n\nBut E_F0 is in energy units. Let's compute E_F0 in MeV.\n\nFirst, compute ħ²/(2m) in MeV·fm²:\n\nħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm\n\nSo ħ²/(2m) = (ħc)^2 / (2mc²) ) * 1/fm²\n\nmc² for proton is 938.272 MeV\n\nThus,\n\nħ²/(2m) = (197.33 MeV·fm)^2 / (2 * 938.272 MeV) ) * 1/fm²\n\n= (197.33² / (2 * 938.272)) MeV²·fm² / MeV * 1/fm²\n\n= (197.33² / (2 * 938.272)) MeV\n\nCalculate numerator: 197.33² ≈ 38944\n\nDenominator: 2 * 938.272 ≈ 1876.544\n\nSo 38944 / 1876.544 ≈ 20.75 MeV\n\nThus, ħ²/(2m) ≈ 20.75 MeV·fm² * 1/fm² = 20.75 MeV\n\nWait, no. Wait, the units:\n\nWait, (ħc)^2 is (MeV·fm)^2, divided by (mc²) in MeV gives MeV·fm², then divided by fm² gives MeV.\n\nWait, let's re-express:\n\nE_F0 = (ħ²/(2m)) * (9π/8)^{2/3} / R₀²\n\nBut R₀ is in fm, so R₀² is in fm².\n\nBut (ħc)^2/(mc²) has units of MeV·fm².\n\nSo:\n\nE_F0 = [ (ħc)^2 / (2mc²) ) * (9π/8)^{2/3} ] / R₀²\n\nPlugging numbers:\n\n(ħc)^2 = (197.33 MeV·fm)^2 ≈ 38944 MeV²·fm²\n\nmc² = 938.272 MeV\n\nThus,\n\n(ħc)^2/(2mc²) = 38944 / (2*938.272) ≈ 38944 / 1876.544 ≈ 20.75 MeV·fm²\n\nMultiply by (9π/8)^{2/3} ≈ 2.32:\n\n20.75 * 2.32 ≈ 48.14 MeV·fm²\n\nDivide by R₀². R₀ ≈ 1.2 fm, so R₀² ≈ 1.44 fm²\n\nThus,\n\nE_F0 ≈ 48.14 MeV·fm² / 1.44 fm² ≈ 33.43 MeV\n\nThen a₄ = (2/5) * E_F0 ≈ (2/5)*33.43 ≈ 13.37 MeV\n\nBut wait, the asymmetry term in the binding energy formula is given as -a₄ (A - 2Z)^2 / A. The value of a₄ from experiments is around 23 MeV. Hmm, but our estimate here gives ~13 MeV. There's a discrepancy. Why?\n\nWait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let's check the steps again.\n\nFirst, compute (ħc)^2/(2mc²):\n\n(197.33)^2 / (2*938.272) = (38944.5) / (1876.544) ≈ 20.75 MeV·fm²\n\nMultiply by (9π/8)^{2/3} ≈ 2.32:\n\n20.75 * 2.32 ≈ 48.14 MeV·fm²\n\nDivide by R₀² (1.2 fm)^2 = 1.44 fm²:\n\n48.14 / 1.44 ≈ 33.43 MeV\n\nThen a₄ = (2/5)*33.43 ≈ 13.37 MeV\n\nBut the empirical value of a₄ is about 23.2 MeV. So our estimate is about half of that. What's missing?\n\nAh, perhaps in the Fermi gas model, we considered only protons and neutrons as free particles, but in reality, the asymmetry term also includes the potential energy contribution. The kinetic energy contributes part of the asymmetry term, but there's also a potential energy part. However, the question says to use the Fermi gas model to estimate a₄. Maybe the model only accounts for the kinetic energy, hence the discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed a factor. Let's see. The total kinetic energy asymmetry term was found to be ΔT = (2/5) E_F0 (A - 2Z)^2 / A. But in the binding energy formula, the term is -a₄ (A - 2Z)^2 / A. Therefore, a₄ = (2/5) E_F0. But our calculation gave E_F0 ≈33.4 MeV, so a₄≈13.4 MeV. However, the empirical value is around 23 MeV. So perhaps the model underestimates a₄. But the question says to estimate the magnitude using the Fermi gas model. So the answer would be approximately (2/5) times the Fermi energy, which we calculated as ~13 MeV. But maybe there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Fermi energy used here is different. Let me recall that the Fermi energy for nuclear matter is around 38 MeV. If E_F0 ≈ 38 MeV, then a₄ = (2/5)*38 ≈ 15.2 MeV. Still lower than empirical.\n\nWait, maybe the Fermi energy in nuclear matter is higher. Let me check typical values. The Fermi energy for nucleons in a nucleus is roughly about 35-40 MeV. So if E_F0 ≈ 38 MeV, then a₄ ≈ (2/5)*38 ≈ 15.2 MeV. Still, the empirical a₄ is about 23 MeV. So the model gives a lower value. But the question says to estimate using the Fermi gas model, so perhaps this is acceptable. The answer would be a₄ ≈ (2/5) E_F, where E_F is the Fermi energy. Given that E_F is around 38 MeV, then a₄ ≈ 15 MeV. But maybe the exact coefficient is different.\n\nWait, let's re-express the asymmetry term. The total kinetic energy increase is ΔT = (2/5) E_F0 (A - 2Z)^2 / A. But the binding energy is decreased by this amount, so the asymmetry term is -ΔT = - (2/5) E_F0 (A - 2Z)^2 / A. Comparing to the formula given: -a₄ (A - 2Z)^2 / A. Therefore, a₄ = (2/5) E_F0.\n\nIf E_F0 is calculated as ~33 MeV from our previous steps, then a₄ ≈13 MeV. If instead, we take E_F0 as the empirical Fermi energy, say ~38 MeV, then a₄≈15 MeV. However, the question says to use the Fermi gas model and the given radius R = R₀ A¹/³. So we should use the calculation based on R₀.\n\nGiven R₀ ≈1.2 fm, then our calculation gives a₄≈13 MeV. But the standard value is around 23 MeV. This suggests that the Fermi gas model underestimates a₄, possibly because it doesn't account for potential energy contributions to the asymmetry term. However, the question asks to estimate using the Fermi gas model, so the answer would be around 13-15 MeV. But perhaps there's a missing factor. Let me check the expansion again.\n\nWait, in the expansion of the kinetic energy, we assumed small δ. But even so, the coefficient comes out as (2/5) E_F0. Let me check the steps again.\n\nWe had ΔT = (2/5) E_F0 δ² A, where δ = (A - 2Z)/A. Then substituting δ² A = (A - 2Z)^2 / A² * A = (A - 2Z)^2 / A. So ΔT = (2/5) E_F0 (A - 2Z)^2 / A. Therefore, the asymmetry term is -ΔT, so a₄ = (2/5) E_F0.\n\nYes, that's correct. So if E_F0 is calculated as ~33 MeV, then a₄≈13 MeV. But why the discrepancy with the empirical value?\n\nPerhaps because in the liquid drop model, the asymmetry term includes both kinetic and potential energy contributions. The Fermi gas model only accounts for the kinetic part, while the potential part might add to the asymmetry term. However, the question specifies to use the Fermi gas model, so we proceed with the kinetic energy contribution only.\n\nTherefore, the estimated magnitude of a₄ is approximately (2/5) times the Fermi energy, which using our calculation is about 13 MeV. However, to express it symbolically, we can write:\n\na₄ ≈ (2/5) * (ħ²/(2m)) * (9π/8)^{2/3} / R₀²\n\nBut plugging in the numbers as we did gives ~13 MeV. So the answer is a₄ ≈ 13 MeV. But let's check units again to ensure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach. In the Fermi gas model, the asymmetry energy coefficient a₄ is given by:\n\na₄ = (ħ²/(10m)) * (3π²)^{2/3} * (1/(n₀)^{2/3}) )\n\nWhere n₀ is the saturation density. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, from literature, the asymmetry energy term in the Bethe-Weizsäcker formula is approximately 23 MeV, but the Fermi gas model prediction is lower, around 12-15 MeV. So the answer would be approximately 12-15 MeV, derived from the Fermi gas model.\n\nGiven that, the magnitude of a₄ is estimated to be around 13 MeV using the Fermi gas model.\n</think>\n\n(a) The terms in the nuclear binding energy formula are:  \n- **Volume term (\\(a_1 A\\))**: Positive contribution due to cohesive nuclear forces, proportional to the number of nucleons \\(A\\).  \n- **Surface term (\\(-a_2 A^{2/3}\\))**: Negative correction for surface nucleons with fewer neighbors, scaling with surface area (\\(A^{2/3}\\)).  \n- **Coulomb term (\\(-a_3 Z^2 A^{-1/3}\\))**: Negative energy from proton repulsion, proportional to \\(Z^2/R\\) (\\(R \\propto A^{1/3}\\)).  \n- **Asymmetry term (\\(-a_4 (A - 2Z)^2 A^{-1}\\))**: Penalty for neutron-proton imbalance due to Pauli exclusion, scaling with \\((N-Z)^2/A\\).  \n\n(b) For stable isobaric nuclei (\\(A\\) fixed), minimize binding energy with respect to \\(Z\\).

{"id": "atomic/2-22", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve part (a) of this problem where I have to set a lower bound on the elastic proton-neutron forward differential cross-section, disregarding nucleon spin. The given information is the total cross-section σ = 40 mb at a center-of-mass momentum p = 10 GeV/c. Hmm, I remember that there's something called the optical theorem which relates the total cross-section to the forward elastic scattering amplitude. Let me think.\n\nThe optical theorem states that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section. Specifically, the theorem says that the imaginary part of the elastic scattering amplitude in the forward direction (θ = 0) is proportional to the total cross-section. The formula I recall is σ_total = (4π/p) * Im f(0), where f(0) is the forward scattering amplitude. Wait, but here we need the differential cross-section, which is |f(θ)|². So the differential cross-section at θ=0 is dσ_elastic/dΩ|_{θ=0} = |f(0)|².\n\nBut since the optical theorem gives Im f(0) = (p/(4π)) σ_total, maybe I can use that to find a lower bound on |f(0)|². Since f(0) is a complex number, its imaginary part is given by the optical theorem, but the real part is unknown. However, the magnitude squared of a complex number is at least the square of its imaginary part. So |f(0)|² ≥ [Im f(0)]². Therefore, the differential cross-section at θ=0 is at least [Im f(0)]², which would be [(p/(4π)) σ_total]^2. Wait, let me check the units here. The cross-section is in mb, which is 10^-31 m². The momentum p is in GeV/c. Let me convert units if necessary, but maybe the formula is in natural units where ħ=c=1, so units might work out.\n\nWait, let's write down the exact relation. The optical theorem in the center-of-mass frame is:\n\nIm f(0) = (p * σ_total)/(4π)\n\nWhere p is the center-of-mass momentum. Then, the differential elastic cross-section at θ=0 is:\n\ndσ_elastic/dΩ|_{θ=0} = |f(0)|²\n\nBut since f(0) is complex, |f(0)|² = [Re f(0)]² + [Im f(0)]² ≥ [Im f(0)]²\n\nTherefore, the differential cross-section is at least [Im f(0)]² = [ (p σ_total)/(4π) ]²\n\nSo substituting the given values:\n\np = 10 GeV/c. Wait, but in natural units, 1 GeV/c is equivalent to 1 GeV divided by c, but since in natural units c=1, so p is 10 GeV. But when using the formula, we need to make sure the units are consistent. Wait, cross-section σ_total is in mb (millibarns), and 1 barn is 10^-24 cm² = 10^-28 m². So 1 mb is 10^-3 barn = 10^-31 m². But perhaps in natural units, we can use the relation where the cross-section is in units of inverse energy squared. But maybe I need to convert everything into consistent units. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is in natural units where ħ=c=1, so the units can be handled accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is dimensionally correct as is. Let's check the dimensions. The cross-section σ has units of area (L²). The momentum p has units of energy (since in natural units, E = pc, so p has units of energy). The differential cross-section dσ/dΩ has units of area per steradian (L²). The scattering amplitude f(θ) has units of length, because in the Born approximation, f(θ) is related to the potential, and the differential cross-section is |f|², which would have units of L². So if f has units of length, then Im f(0) has units of length. Then, according to the optical theorem:\n\nIm f(0) = (p * σ_total)/(4π)\n\nBut p has units of energy (since in natural units, momentum is energy divided by c, but c=1, so units of energy). Wait, but if p is in energy units, and σ_total is in area (L²), then the right-hand side would have units of energy * area. But Im f(0) is supposed to have units of length. Hmm, maybe there's a missing factor of ħ or c here. Let me recall the exact form of the optical theorem.\n\nWait, the optical theorem in quantum mechanics is:\n\nIm f(k, 0) = (k σ_total)/(4π)\n\nWhere k is the wave number, which is p/ħ. But in natural units (ħ = c = 1), k is equal to p. So in that case, the formula would be Im f(0) = (p σ_total)/(4π). But then, if p is in GeV/c, but in natural units, c=1, so p is in GeV. However, cross-section is in mb, which is 10^-31 m². To make the units work, we need to convert everything into compatible units. Let me check the units carefully.\n\nLet me use SI units. Let's express p in GeV/c. But 1 GeV/c is (1.602×10^-10 J) / (3×10^8 m/s) ) ≈ 5.34×10^-19 kg·m/s. Then, p = 10 GeV/c ≈ 5.34×10^-18 kg·m/s.\n\nThe cross-section σ_total is 40 mb = 40×10^-31 m².\n\nNow, the optical theorem says Im f(0) = (p σ_total)/(4π). Let's compute the right-hand side:\n\np * σ_total / (4π) ≈ (5.34×10^-18 kg·m/s) * (40×10^-31 m²) / (4π)\n\nCalculating the units: kg·m/s * m² = kg·m³/s. But f(0) should have units of meters (since |f|² is in m² for differential cross-section). Wait, kg·m³/s is equivalent to (kg·m²/s²) * s/m = J * s/m. Hmm, this is not matching. Maybe I need to consider the correct formula with proper units. Alternatively, perhaps in natural units where ħ = c = 1, the units are simplified.\n\nIn natural units, ħ = 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, c = 3×10^8 m/s. So when we set ħ = c = 1, the unit conversions become:\n\n1 GeV^{-2} = (ħ c)^2 / (GeV^2) ) = (6.582×10^-25 GeV·s * 3×10^8 m/s)^2 / GeV²\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to convert cross-section from mb to GeV^-2. Since 1 mb = 10^-31 m² = 10^-31 (ħ c / GeV)^2 )^{-1} ?\n\nWait, let's recall that 1 barn = 10^-28 m², and 1 mb = 10^-31 m². To convert m² to GeV^-2, we use the conversion factor:\n\n1 m = (ħ c)/(GeV) )^{-1} ≈ (197.33 MeV·fm ) / GeV )^{-1}\n\nWait, ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. So 1 fm = 10^-15 m. Therefore, 1 m = 10^15 fm. So ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm = 0.19733 GeV·fm. Therefore, 1 GeV^{-1} = (0.19733 fm) / (GeV) * GeV ) = 0.19733 fm. Wait, maybe better to compute 1 m = (ħ c)/(GeV) )^{-1} * 10^15 fm/m. Let me compute 1 m in GeV^{-1}:\n\nħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm = 0.19733 GeV·fm. So 1 fm = 0.19733 GeV^{-1}. Therefore, 1 m = 10^15 fm = 10^15 * 0.19733 GeV^{-1} = 1.9733×10^14 GeV^{-1}. Therefore, 1 m² = (1.9733×10^14 GeV^{-1})^2 ≈ 3.894×10^28 GeV^{-2}. Therefore, 1 mb = 10^-31 m² = 10^-31 * 3.894×10^28 GeV^{-2} ≈ 3.894×10^-3 GeV^{-2}. So 40 mb = 40 * 3.894×10^-3 GeV^{-2} ≈ 0.15576 GeV^{-2}.\n\nNow, the momentum p is given as 10 GeV/c. But in natural units, c=1, so p = 10 GeV.\n\nNow, applying the optical theorem formula in natural units:\n\nIm f(0) = (p * σ_total) / (4π)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nIm f(0) = (10 GeV * 0.15576 GeV^{-2}) / (4π) ≈ (1.5576 GeV^{-1}) / (4π) ≈ 1.5576 / (4π) GeV^{-1}\n\nWait, but GeV^{-1} is in inverse energy. However, f(0) should be dimensionless? Wait, no. The scattering amplitude f(θ) has units of length in SI units, but in natural units, since cross-section is in GeV^{-2}, and dσ/dΩ is |f|², then f must have units of GeV^{-1}. Because |f|² (GeV^{-2}) is the differential cross-section (GeV^{-2} per steradian?), but wait, differential cross-section dσ/dΩ has units of GeV^{-2} (since σ is GeV^{-2}, and Ω is dimensionless). So f must have units of GeV^{-1}.\n\nBut according to the formula, Im f(0) = (p * σ_total)/(4π). p is in GeV, σ_total is in GeV^{-2}, so GeV * GeV^{-2} = GeV^{-1}, which matches the units of f(0). So that's correct.\n\nSo Im f(0) = (10 GeV * 0.15576 GeV^{-2}) / (4π) ≈ (1.5576 GeV^{-1}) / (4π) ≈ 0.124 GeV^{-1}\n\nBut then, the differential cross-section at θ=0 is |f(0)|². Since |f(0)|² ≥ [Im f(0)]², then:\n\ndσ/dΩ|_{θ=0} ≥ [Im f(0)]² = (0.124 GeV^{-1})² ≈ 0.0154 GeV^{-2}\n\nBut we need to convert this back to mb/sr. Since 1 GeV^{-2} ≈ 0.3894 mb (from earlier: 1 mb ≈ 3.894×10^-3 GeV^{-2}, so 1 GeV^{-2} ≈ 1 / 3.894×10^-3 mb ≈ 257. mb). Wait, wait, earlier calculation showed that 1 mb ≈ 3.894×10^-3 GeV^{-2}, so 1 GeV^{-2} ≈ 1 / 3.894×10^-3 mb ≈ 257 mb. Therefore, 0.0154 GeV^{-2} ≈ 0.0154 * 257 mb ≈ 3.96 mb/sr.\n\nWait, but differential cross-section is in mb/sr (millibarns per steradian). So the lower bound is approximately 3.96 mb/sr. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, 1 mb = 3.894×10^-3 GeV^{-2} (from 40 mb = 0.15576 GeV^{-2}, so 1 mb = 0.15576 /40 ≈ 0.003894 GeV^{-2}).\n\nTherefore, 1 GeV^{-2} = 1 / 0.003894 mb ≈ 257 mb.\n\nSo [Im f(0)]² = (0.124 GeV^{-1})² = 0.015376 GeV^{-2}\n\nConvert that to mb:\n\n0.015376 GeV^{-2} * 257 mb/GeV^{-2} ≈ 3.95 mb\n\nSo the lower bound on the differential cross-section is approximately 3.95 mb/sr. Rounding to one decimal place, maybe 4.0 mb/sr. But let me check the exact calculation again.\n\nWait, let's redo the steps:\n\n1. Convert σ_total from mb to GeV^{-2}:\n\nσ_total = 40 mb = 40 * 3.894×10^-3 GeV^{-2} ≈ 0.15576 GeV^{-2}\n\n2. Compute Im f(0) = (p * σ_total)/(4π) = (10 GeV * 0.15576 GeV^{-2}) / (4π) = (1.5576 GeV^{-1}) / (4π) ≈ 1.5576 / 12.566 ≈ 0.1239 GeV^{-1}\n\n3. Then [Im f(0)]² = (0.1239)^2 ≈ 0.01535 GeV^{-2}\n\n4. Convert GeV^{-2} to mb:\n\n0.01535 GeV^{-2} * (1 / 3.894×10^-3 mb/GeV^{-2}) ≈ 0.01535 / 0.003894 ≈ 3.94 mb\n\nSo approximately 3.94 mb/sr. So the lower bound is about 3.9 mb/sr, which we can write as 4 mb/sr. But maybe the exact value is (10*40/(4π))^2 * conversion factor. Wait, perhaps there's a simpler way without converting units.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula that directly gives the lower bound in terms of the total cross-section. Let me recall that the differential cross-section at θ=0 satisfies dσ/dΩ|_{θ=0} ≥ (σ_total^2)/(16π^2) * (p^2). Wait, but units might not match. Wait, let's see:\n\nFrom the optical theorem, Im f(0) = (p σ_total)/(4π). Then |f(0)|² ≥ [Im f(0)]² = (p^2 σ_total^2)/(16π^2). Then dσ/dΩ|_{θ=0} = |f(0)|² ≥ (p^2 σ_total^2)/(16π^2). But this would be in units of (GeV^2 * mb^2)/(GeV^{-4}) ??? Wait, no, perhaps not. Wait, in natural units, σ_total is in GeV^{-2}, p is in GeV. Then:\n\n(p * σ_total) has units GeV * GeV^{-2} = GeV^{-1}, so Im f(0) is in GeV^{-1}. Then [Im f(0)]² is in GeV^{-2}, which is the same as the units of cross-section per steradian. Wait, but cross-section σ is in GeV^{-2}, and differential cross-section dσ/dΩ is in GeV^{-2}/sr. So if [Im f(0)]² is in GeV^{-2}, then multiplying by sr would give cross-section. Wait, no, the differential cross-section is |f|², which is in GeV^{-2}/sr. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\ndσ/dΩ|_{θ=0} ≥ [ (σ_total p)^2 ] / (16 π^2 )\n\nBut then, if we use the correct units, let's see:\n\nσ_total in mb, p in GeV/c. But we need to convert everything into compatible units. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express the lower bound without unit conversion by using the optical theorem directly.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is simply (σ_total^2)/(16π^2) * (p^2), but with the proper unit conversions. Alternatively, maybe the lower bound is (σ_total/(4π))^2 * (p^2). Wait, let's think again.\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n1. Optical theorem: Im f(0) = (p σ_total)/(4π)\n\n2. |f(0)|² ≥ [Im f(0)]² = (p σ_total / 4π)^2\n\n3. Therefore, dσ/dΩ|_{θ=0} = |f(0)|² ≥ (p σ_total / 4π)^2\n\nBut this gives the lower bound in terms of p and σ_total. However, the units here need to be considered. If p is in GeV/c and σ_total is in mb, then we need to convert to compatible units to get the differential cross-section in mb/sr.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is simply (σ_total^2)/(16π^2) * (p^2), but with p in appropriate units. Wait, but in natural units where c=1, p is in GeV, and σ_total is in GeV^{-2}, then (p σ_total) is GeV * GeV^{-2} = GeV^{-1}, so (p σ_total / 4π)^2 is GeV^{-2}, which is the same as the units of dσ/dΩ (GeV^{-2}/sr). Wait, but sr is dimensionless, so dσ/dΩ has units of GeV^{-2}. Therefore, the lower bound is (p σ_total / 4π)^2 in units of GeV^{-4}? Wait, no, that can't be. I think I'm getting confused with the units here. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nLet me use the formula in natural units where ħ = c = 1. Then, the optical theorem is:\n\nIm f(0) = (p σ_total)/(4π)\n\nHere, p is in GeV, σ_total is in GeV^{-2}, so the product p σ_total is GeV * GeV^{-2} = GeV^{-1}, so Im f(0) has units of GeV^{-1}. The scattering amplitude f(θ) has units of GeV^{-1} because the differential cross-section |f|² has units of GeV^{-2} (since cross-section is in GeV^{-2} and dΩ is dimensionless). Therefore, |f(0)|² has units of GeV^{-2}, which matches the units of dσ/dΩ (since dσ/dΩ is cross-section per steradian, and steradian is dimensionless). Therefore, the lower bound is:\n\ndσ/dΩ|_{θ=0} ≥ [Im f(0)]² = (p σ_total / 4π)^2\n\nNow, substituting the given values:\n\np = 10 GeV\n\nσ_total = 40 mb = 40 * 10^{-31} m². But we need to convert this to GeV^{-2}.\n\nAs calculated earlier, 1 mb ≈ 3.894×10^{-3} GeV^{-2}, so 40 mb ≈ 40 * 3.894×10^{-3} ≈ 0.15576 GeV^{-2}\n\nTherefore:\n\ndσ/dΩ|_{θ=0} ≥ (10 GeV * 0.15576 GeV^{-2} / 4π)^2\n\nCalculate the term inside the square:\n\n10 * 0.15576 = 1.5576\n\nDivide by 4π: 1.5576 / (4 * 3.1416) ≈ 1.5576 / 12.566 ≈ 0.1239 GeV^{-1}\n\nNow square that: (0.1239 GeV^{-1})^2 ≈ 0.01535 GeV^{-2}\n\nConvert this back to mb/sr:\n\n0.01535 GeV^{-2} * (1 mb / 3.894×10^{-3} GeV^{-2}) ≈ 0.01535 / 0.003894 ≈ 3.94 mb/sr\n\nSo approximately 3.9 mb/sr. Rounding to two significant figures, since the given σ_total is 40 mb (one significant figure?), but maybe it's two. The problem states 40 mb, which is two significant figures. So the lower bound would be approximately 3.9 mb/sr, which we can write as 3.9 mb/sr or 4 mb/sr. But let's check the exact calculation again.\n\nWait, 40 mb is 40.0 mb (two sig figs?), so the answer should have two significant figures. So 3.9 becomes 3.9 mb/sr. But let's compute more accurately:\n\nIm f(0) = (10 * 0.15576) / (4π) = 1.5576 / 12.566370614 ≈ 0.123915 GeV^{-1}\n\nSquaring that: (0.123915)^2 ≈ 0.015355 GeV^{-2}\n\nConvert to mb: 0.015355 GeV^{-2} * (1 mb / 0.003894 GeV^{-2}) ≈ 0.015355 / 0.003894 ≈ 3.943\n\nSo approximately 3.94 mb/sr. So with two significant figures, that's 3.9 mb/sr. But maybe the problem expects an exact expression in terms of σ_total and p without plugging in numbers, but the question says to set a lower bound given the numbers. So the answer is approximately 4 mb/sr, but more precisely 3.9 mb/sr. However, let's see if there's a formulaic answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lower bound is (σ_total^2)/(16π^2) * p^2. But when we plug in the numbers, that's (40^2)/(16π^2) * (10)^2, but units are messed up. Wait, no, because σ_total is in mb and p is in GeV/c. This approach might not be correct without unit conversions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is (σ_total^2)/(16π) * (p^2), but I need to verify. Wait, from the steps above, the lower bound is [ (p σ_total)/(4π) ]^2. So that's (p^2 σ_total^2)/(16 π^2). Then, converting σ_total from mb to appropriate units. But perhaps the answer is simply expressed as (σ_total p / (4π))^2, and then converted into mb/sr using the appropriate conversion factors. But since we did the unit conversion, the numerical answer is approximately 3.9 mb/sr.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"set a lower bound on the elastic center-of-mass proton-neutron forward differential cross-section.\" So the answer is that the differential cross-section at θ=0 is at least (σ_total p / (4π))^2, which after unit conversion gives approximately 4 mb/sr. Therefore, the lower bound is 4 mb/sr.\n\nBut let me check standard references. For example, in particle physics, the optical theorem gives a relation between the total cross-section and the imaginary part of the forward amplitude. The differential cross-section for elastic scattering is |f(θ)|^2, and at θ=0, it's |f(0)|^2. Since the imaginary part of f(0) is known via the optical theorem, and the real part could be anything, the minimum possible value of |f(0)|^2 occurs when the real part is zero. Therefore, the minimum value is [Im f(0)]^2, leading to the lower bound on the differential cross-section.\n\nTherefore, the lower bound is [ (p σ_total)/(4π) ]^2. After converting units, this gives approximately 3.9 mb/sr. So the answer should be approximately 4 mb/sr. But let me check if there's a standard formula for this lower bound.\n\nYes, this is a standard result. The lower bound on the forward elastic differential cross-section is given by (σ_total^2)/(16π^2) * (p^2), but with proper unit conversions. However, when plugging in the numbers with units converted, we get around 4 mb/sr. Therefore, the answer to part (a) is approximately 4 mb/sr.\n\nFor part (b), if experiments found a violation of this bound, it would imply that the assumptions used in deriving the bound are incorrect. Since the bound relies on the optical theorem and the Schwarz inequality (|f|^2 ≥ [Im f]^2), a violation would mean that either the optical theorem is not applicable (which requires certain conditions like unitarity and analyticity) or that the theory violates these fundamental principles. This could suggest new physics beyond the standard model, such as violations of unitarity in quantum mechanics, which would have profound implications.\n</think>\n\n(a) To set a lower bound on the elastic forward differential cross-section, we use the optical theorem, which relates the total cross-section \\(\\sigma_{\\text{total}}\\) to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude \\(f(0)\\):  \n\\[\n\\text{Im}\\, f(0) = \\frac{p \\, \\sigma_{\\text{total}}}{4\\pi},\n\\]  \nwhere \\(p = 10 \\, \\text{GeV/c}\\) is the center-of-mass momentum. The differential elastic cross-section at \\(\\theta = 0\\) is \\(d\\sigma_{\\text{elastic}}/d\\Omega = |f(0)|^2\\). Since \\(|f(0)|^2 \\geq [\\text{Im}\\, f(0)]^2\\), the lower bound is:  \n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega}\\right)_{\\theta=0} \\geq \\left(\\frac{p \\, \\sigma_{\\text{total}}}{4\\pi}\\right)^2.\n\\]  \nSubstituting \\(p = 10 \\, \\text{GeV}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{\\text{total}} = 40 \\, \\text{mb} = 0.15576 \\, \\text{GeV}^{-2}\\) (after unit conversion), we compute:  \n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{10 \\cdot 0.15576}{4\\pi}\\right)^2 \\approx 3.94 \\, \\text{mb/sr}.\n\\]  \nRounding to two significant figures, the lower bound is:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{4 \\, \\text{mb/sr}}.\n\\]\n\n(b) A violation of this bound would imply a breakdown of the fundamental principles underlying the optical theorem or unitarity in quantum mechanics. This could signal new physics, such as non-local interactions, violations of causality, or exotic processes beyond the Standard Model.  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4 \\, \\text{mb/sr}}\n\\]  \nFor part (b):  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Unitarity or the optical theorem is violated, indicating new physics.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["4 \\, \\text{mb/sr}", "4 \\, \\text{mb/sr}", "\\text{Unitarity or the optical theorem is violated, indicating new physics.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "4 \\, \\text{mb/sr}", "expr2": "2.6 \\, b"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "4 \\, \\text{mb/sr}", "expr2": "\\text{Violation of optical theorem and unitarity of } S\\text{-matrix, indicating a breach in the probabilistic interpretation of quantum theory.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "4 \\, \\text{mb/sr}", "expr2": "2.6 \\, b"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "4 \\, \\text{mb/sr}", "expr2": "\\text{Violation of optical theorem and unitarity of } S\\text{-matrix, indicating a breach in the probabilistic interpretation of quantum theory.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Unitarity or the optical theorem is violated, indicating new physics.}", "expr2": "2.6 \\, b"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Unitarity or the optical theorem is violated, indicating new physics.}", "expr2": "\\text{Violation of optical theorem and unitarity of } S\\text{-matrix, indicating a breach in the probabilistic interpretation of quantum theory.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.3333333333333333}
{"id": "atomic/2-14", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The problem is to fill in the missing entries in the table for various isotopes. The missing entries are T_z, T, and sometimes J^p or mass excess. Let me recall the definitions and formulas needed here.\n\nFirst, the mass excess ΔM is given, and the atomic mass M is calculated as A*931.5 MeV + ΔM. But maybe that's more relevant for part (b). For part (a), the main thing is to figure out T_z and T for each isotope.\n\nI remember that T_z is defined as (N - Z)/2. Since Z is the number of protons and N is the number of neutrons. So for each isotope, A = Z + N, so N = A - Z. Therefore, T_z = (A - 2Z)/2. Let me check that. For example, for a neutron, Z=0, A=1, so N=1. Then T_z = (1 - 0)/2 = 0.5. Wait, but the neutron is n, Z=0. So T_z = (N - Z)/2 = (1 - 0)/2 = 0.5. So the neutron should have T_z = 1/2. Let me check the table. The neutron's entry has Z=0, and T_z is missing. So according to this, T_z for neutron is 1/2. Then T is the total isospin. For a single nucleon, like the neutron or proton, the isospin T is 1/2. Because nucleons are in the doublet (proton and neutron) with T=1/2. So for the neutron, T=1/2, T_z=-1/2? Wait, wait. Wait, I might be mixing conventions here. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the convention for T_z. The proton has T_z = +1/2, and the neutron has T_z = -1/2. Because in the isospin formalism, the proton is considered as the state with T_z = +1/2 and the neutron as T_z = -1/2. But when dealing with nuclei, the total T_z is (N - Z)/2. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, for a nucleus with Z protons and N neutrons, each proton contributes T_z = +1/2, each neutron contributes T_z = -1/2. So total T_z = (Z*(1/2) + N*(-1/2))? Wait, no. Wait, each proton has T_z = +1/2, each neutron T_z = -1/2. So the total T_z for the nucleus would be sum over all nucleons. But for a nucleus, the total isospin is a bit more complicated. However, the formula T_z = (N - Z)/2 is commonly used. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, for a nucleus, T_z is defined as (N - Z)/2. Because each proton contributes T_z = +1/2, each neutron T_z = -1/2. So total T_z = (Z*(1/2) + N*(-1/2)) = (Z - N)/2*(-1) = (N - Z)/2. Wait, that's correct. So T_z = (N - Z)/2. So for a nucleus, T_z is (N - Z)/2. So for example, for ^1H (which is a proton), Z=1, N=0. So T_z = (0 - 1)/2 = -0.5. But wait, the proton as a nucleon has T_z = +1/2, but when considering the nucleus ^1H (which is just a proton), then N=0, Z=1, so T_z = (0 -1)/2 = -1/2. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the convention here is different. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps the definition of T_z for a nucleus is (Z - N)/2? No, that would be opposite. Let me check a standard reference. In nuclear physics, the isospin projection T_z is given by T_z = (Z - N)/2. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, the proton has T_z = +1/2, neutron T_z = -1/2. So for a nucleus with Z protons and N neutrons, the total T_z would be Z*(1/2) + N*(-1/2) = (Z - N)/2. So T_z = (Z - N)/2. Wait, but that contradicts the previous thought. Wait, let's take an example. Take ^4He, which has Z=2, N=2 (since A=4). Then T_z = (2 - 2)/2 = 0. That makes sense. For a nucleus with equal protons and neutrons, T_z=0. For ^1H (proton), Z=1, N=0. Then T_z=(1 - 0)/2 = 0.5. But the proton as a nucleon has T_z=+1/2. So that matches. Wait, but in the table, for ^1H, Z=1. So according to this formula, T_z=(1 - 0)/2 = 0.5. So the entry for ^1H should have T_z=0.5. But in the table, the entry for ^1H is missing T_z, T, J^p, and mass excess. Wait, the mass excess is given as 7.29 MeV. So the user probably wants us to compute T_z, T, J^p for each isotope.\n\nWait, but the neutron has Z=0, A=1, so N=1. Then T_z=(0 -1)/2 = -0.5. But the neutron as a nucleon has T_z=-1/2, which matches. So the formula T_z=(Z - N)/2 gives for the neutron (Z=0, N=1): T_z=(0 -1)/2 = -0.5. So that's correct. So the formula is T_z = (Z - N)/2. Wait, but that would be T_z = (Z - (A - Z))/2 = (2Z - A)/2. Hmm. Alternatively, since N = A - Z, T_z = (Z - (A - Z))/2 = (2Z - A)/2 = Z - A/2. Wait, but that's equivalent. So for example, for ^4He (Z=2, A=4), N=2. T_z=(2 - 2)/2=0. Correct. For ^1H (Z=1, A=1), N=0. T_z=(1 - 0)/2=0.5. So that's the proton, which as a nucleon has T_z=+1/2. Wait, but according to the formula, T_z=(Z - N)/2. So for ^1H, T_z= (1 - 0)/2=0.5. But the proton's T_z is +1/2. So that's correct. So the formula gives T_z=0.5 for ^1H, which is correct. Similarly, neutron has T_z=(0 -1)/2=-0.5, which is correct. So the formula is T_z=(Z - N)/2. Wait, but in some references, T_z is defined as (N - Z)/2. Wait, this is a possible source of confusion. Let me check.\n\nWait, according to Krane's Introductory Nuclear Physics, the convention is that for a nucleus, T_z = (N - Z)/2. Wait, that would be different. Let me check. For example, if T_z is (N - Z)/2, then for ^1H (Z=1, N=0), T_z=(0 -1)/2=-0.5. But the proton has T_z=+1/2. So that contradicts. So perhaps different conventions are used. Wait, maybe the definition depends on whether you're considering the nucleus as a collection of nucleons, each with their own isospin. The total isospin is obtained by summing the individual isospins. For protons, each has T_z=+1/2, neutrons T_z=-1/2. So total T_z = (number of protons)*(+1/2) + (number of neutrons)*(-1/2) = [Z - N]/2. So that would be T_z=(Z - N)/2. But if you define T_z as (N - Z)/2, then it's the negative. So this is a critical point. The problem statement says \"Define your convention for T_z.\" So perhaps the user expects us to state the convention. But in part (a), we need to fill in the table. So perhaps the standard convention is T_z=(N - Z)/2? Wait, but that would lead to the proton (^1H) having T_z=-1/2, which conflicts with the nucleon's own T_z. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the nucleus's T_z is the negative of the sum of the individual nucleons' T_z. Let me think.\n\nWait, the total isospin projection T_z for the nucleus is the sum of the individual nucleons' T_z. Each proton contributes T_z=+1/2, each neutron T_z=-1/2. So total T_z = (Z*(+1/2) + N*(-1/2)) = (Z - N)/2. Therefore, T_z = (Z - N)/2. But if the nucleus is considered as a state in isospin space, then the third component is T_z. For example, a nucleus with more protons would have a higher T_z. Wait, but let's take an example. Take ^3H (tritium), Z=1, N=2. Then T_z=(1 - 2)/2 = -0.5. But tritium is a neutron-rich nucleus, so it's in a lower T_z state. Alternatively, if T_z=(N - Z)/2, then T_z=(2 -1)/2=0.5. Which is correct? Let me check a standard source.\n\nAccording to the textbook \"Nuclear and Particle Physics\" by Williams, the isospin projection T_z for a nucleus is given by T_z = (N - Z)/2. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous calculation. Wait, if T_z=(N - Z)/2, then for ^1H (Z=1, N=0), T_z=(0 -1)/2=-0.5. But the proton's T_z is +1/2. So this seems contradictory. Alternatively, perhaps the definition is T_z = (Z - N)/2. Let me check another source. From the Wikipedia page on Isospin: For a nucleus with Z protons and N neutrons, the third component of isospin is T_z = (Z - N)/2. So that would mean T_z=(Z - N)/2. Therefore, for ^1H, T_z=(1 -0)/2=0.5. Which matches the proton's T_z. For the neutron (Z=0, N=1), T_z=(0 -1)/2=-0.5, which matches. For ^4He (Z=2, N=2), T_z=0. So that seems correct. Therefore, the convention here is T_z=(Z - N)/2. Wait, but that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Wait, no. Wait, if T_z is defined as (Z - N)/2, then for a nucleus with more protons than neutrons, T_z is positive. For example, ^13C (Z=6, N=7), T_z=(6 -7)/2=-0.5. Wait, but that's a neutron-rich nucleus. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me check with a standard example. Take ^12C (Z=6, N=6), T_z=0. For ^14C (Z=6, N=8), T_z=(6 -8)/2=-1. So that's a negative T_z. But ^14C is neutron-rich, so lower T_z. So that makes sense. So the formula T_z=(Z - N)/2. Therefore, for a nucleus, T_z=(Z - N)/2. So that's the convention. Therefore, in the table, for each isotope, compute T_z as (Z - (A - Z))/2 = (2Z - A)/2. Because N = A - Z. So T_z=(2Z - A)/2. Let's verify with the neutron: Z=0, A=1. T_z=(0 -1)/2=-0.5. Correct. For ^1H: Z=1, A=1. T_z=(2*1 -1)/2=(2 -1)/2=0.5. Correct. For ^4He: Z=2, A=4. T_z=(4 -4)/2=0. Correct. So the formula is T_z=(2Z - A)/2. Alternatively, T_z=Z - A/2. Either way.\n\nSo for each isotope in the table, compute T_z as (Z - (A - Z))/2 = (2Z - A)/2. Let's proceed to fill in the T_z for each isotope.\n\nStarting with the neutron: Z=0, A=1. T_z=(0 -1)/2=-0.5. So T_z=-1/2. Then T for the neutron: since it's a single nucleon, T=1/2. Similarly, for ^1H (proton), Z=1, A=1. T_z=(2*1 -1)/2=0.5. So T_z=1/2. T=1/2. J^p for neutron is 1/2+, and for ^1H (proton) is 1/2+ as well. Wait, but in the table, the neutron's J^p is missing. The neutron has spin 1/2 and parity +. So J^p=1/2+. Similarly, ^1H (proton) is also 1/2+.\n\nFor ^4He: Z=2, A=4. T_z=(2*2 -4)/2=(4-4)/2=0. So T_z=0. For ^4He, which is a doubly magic nucleus (closed shell), the ground state has J^p=0+. The total isospin T for ^4He: since T_z=0, and the nucleus is in an isosinglet state (since all nucleons are paired), T=0. Because for a nucleus with T_z=0, the minimum possible T is |T_z|=0, so T=0. So T=0.\n\nNow moving to the other isotopes. Let's take ^77Se: Z=34, A=77. So N=77-34=43. T_z=(34 -43)/2=(-9)/2=-4.5. So T_z=-9/2. Wait, but T_z is (Z - N)/2=(34 -43)/2=-4.5. So T_z=-4.5. Then T must be ≥ |T_z|, so T≥4.5. But T must be integer or half-integer. Since A=77, which is odd (since 77 is odd), the number of protons is 34 (even), neutrons 43 (odd). So the total number of nucleons is odd, so the total isospin T should be a half-integer. Since T_z=-4.5, the minimum T is 4.5. So T=9/2. Wait, but how to determine T? For a nucleus, the total isospin T is determined by the configuration of the nucleons. For a nucleus with T_z=(Z - N)/2, the possible T can range from |T_z| upwards. The ground state usually has the lowest possible T, which is |T_z|. So if T_z=-4.5, then T=4.5. So T=9/2. But I need to confirm this. For example, in a nucleus with T_z=(Z - N)/2, the ground state is expected to have the minimal possible T, which is |T_z|. So if T_z is negative, T is |T_z|. So for ^77Se, T=9/2. Similarly, for ^77Br: Z=35, A=77. N=42. T_z=(35 -42)/2=(-7)/2=-3.5. So T_z=-7/2. Then T=7/2. For ^77Kr: Z=36, A=77. N=41. T_z=(36 -41)/2=(-5)/2=-2.5. So T_z=-5/2. T=5/2.\n\nBut wait, the table already has some entries. For example, ^77Se has J^p=1/2^-. So maybe the T value is not necessarily equal to |T_z|. Wait, but in the case of ^4He, T_z=0, T=0. So that's minimal. For a nucleus with T_z=-4.5, the minimal T is 4.5. But perhaps in reality, the ground state may have higher T. However, generally, the ground state is expected to have the lowest possible T, i.e., T=|T_z|. Because higher T states would be more energetic. So assuming that, then T=|T_z|. So for ^77Se, T=9/2. Similarly, for ^77Br, T=7/2. For ^77Kr, T=5/2.\n\nBut let's check if this holds for other entries. For example, ^80Br: Z=35, A=80. N=45. T_z=(35 -45)/2=(-10)/2=-5. So T_z=-5. Then T=5. Since A=80 is even, Z=35 is odd, N=45 is odd. So total number of nucleons is even (35+45=80). So the total T must be integer. Since T_z=-5, T=5. Then J^p is given as 1+. So that's filled in.\n\nFor ^80Kr: Z=36, A=80. N=44. T_z=(36 -44)/2=(-8)/2=-4. So T_z=-4. T=4. J^p is missing. The mass excess is given as -77.90 MeV.\n\nFor ^81Br: Z=35, A=81. N=46. T_z=(35 -46)/2=(-11)/2=-5.5. So T_z=-11/2. T=11/2. J^p is given as 3/2^-.\n\nFor ^81Kr: Z=36, A=81. N=45. T_z=(36 -45)/2=(-9)/2=-4.5. T=9/2. J^p is given as 7/2^+.\n\nFor ^81Rb: Z=37, A=81. N=44. T_z=(37 -44)/2=(-7)/2=-3.5. T=7/2. J^p is given as 3/2^-.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that T is equal to |T_z|. Therefore, for each nucleus, T=|T_z|. Therefore, T is the absolute value of T_z. So for example, neutron: T_z=-1/2, T=1/2. ^1H: T_z=1/2, T=1/2. ^4He: T_z=0, T=0. For ^77Se: T_z=-9/2, T=9/2. And so on.\n\nTherefore, the missing entries can be filled as follows:\n\nNeutron (n): Z=0, T_z=-1/2, T=1/2, J^p=1/2^+.\n\n^1H: Z=1, T_z=1/2, T=1/2, J^p=1/2^+.\n\n^4He: Z=2, T_z=0, T=0, J^p=0^+.\n\nFor the other isotopes:\n\n^77Se: Z=34, T_z=(34 -43)/2=-9/2, T=9/2, J^p=1/2^- (given).\n\n^77Br: Z=35, T_z=(35 -42)/2=-7/2, T=7/2, J^p=3/2^- (given).\n\n^77Kr: Z=36, T_z=(36 -41)/2=-5/2, T=5/2, J^p=7/2^+ (given).\n\n^80Br: Z=35, A=80, N=45. T_z=(35 -45)/2=-5, T=5, J^p=1+ (given).\n\n^80Kr: Z=36, A=80, N=44. T_z=(36 -44)/2=-4, T=4. J^p is missing. Wait, the J^p for ^80Kr is missing. Let's see. The mass excess is given as -77.90 MeV. How to find J^p? Maybe from neighboring isotopes or systematics. Alternatively, perhaps it's a known value. For example, ^80Kr is a stable isotope. Let me recall. Krypton-80 has Z=36, N=44. It's even-even, so the ground state should have J^p=0^+. Because even-even nuclei have 0+ ground states. So J^p=0^+.\n\n^81Br: Z=35, T_z=-11/2, T=11/2, J^p=3/2^- (given).\n\n^81Kr: Z=36, T_z=-9/2, T=9/2, J^p=7/2^+ (given).\n\n^81Rb: Z=37, T_z=-7/2, T=7/2, J^p=3/2^- (given).\n\nSo filling in the table:\n\nFor neutron:\n\nT_z = -1/2, T=1/2, J^p=1/2^+.\n\nFor ^1H:\n\nT_z=1/2, T=1/2, J^p=1/2^+.\n\nFor ^4He:\n\nT_z=0, T=0, J^p=0^+.\n\nFor ^80Kr:\n\nT_z=-4, T=4, J^p=0^+.\n\nNow, part (a) is done. Let's move to part (b).\n\n(b) The wave function of the isobaric analog state (IAS) in ^81Kr is obtained by operating on the ^81Br ground state wave function with the isospin raising operator T_+.\n\n(i) What are J^π, T, and T_z for the IAS in ^81Kr?\n\nFirst, the isobaric analog state (IAS) is created by raising the isospin of the parent nucleus. The parent here is ^81Br (Z=35, A=81). The ground state of ^81Br has T and T_z. From part (a), ^81Br has T=11/2 and T_z=-11/2 (since T_z=(35 -46)/2=-11/2). Applying the isospin raising operator T_+ will increase T_z by 1, but keep T the same. Because T_+ raises T_z by 1. So the IAS in ^81Kr will have T=11/2 (same as the parent), and T_z= T_z_parent +1 = (-11/2) +1 = -9/2. But wait, ^81Kr has Z=36, so let's check its T_z. For ^81Kr, Z=36, A=81, N=45. T_z=(36 -45)/2=-9/2. Which matches. So the IAS in ^81Kr has the same T as the parent ^81Br, which is T=11/2, and T_z=-9/2 +1? Wait, no. Wait, the parent is ^81Br with T=11/2 and T_z=-11/2. Applying T_+ operator increases T_z by 1, so the IAS will have T_z=-11/2 +1 = -9/2. And T remains the same, T=11/2. So the IAS in ^81Kr has T=11/2, T_z=-9/2. The J^π (spin and parity) of the IAS should be the same as the parent state, because the isospin raising operator does not affect the spatial or spin parts of the wave function. The parent ^81Br has J^π=3/2^-. Therefore, the IAS in ^81Kr should also have J^π=3/2^-.\n\nWait, but the ground state of ^81Kr has J^π=7/2^+ as per the table. But the IAS is an excited state in ^81Kr with the same J^π as the parent ^81Br. So the answer should be J^π=3/2^-, T=11/2, T_z=-9/2.\n\n(ii) Estimate the excitation energy of the IAS in ^81Kr.\n\nThe excitation energy of the IAS can be estimated using the formula involving the Coulomb displacement energy. The IAS is higher in energy due to the Coulomb repulsion. The energy difference between the IAS and the parent state (corrected for mass differences) is given by the Coulomb displacement energy. The formula is approximately:\n\nE_x ≈ ΔE_C = (e²/(4πε₀)) * (3/(5R)) * (Z_child*(Z_child -1) - Z_parent*(Z_parent -1))\n\nWhere R is the nuclear radius, R = r₀ A^(1/3), with r₀ ≈ 1.2 fm.\n\nAlternatively, a simpler approach is to use the mass difference between the parent and the daughter, adjusted for the Coulomb shift. Another approach is to use the difference in the mass excesses of the parent and the IAS, but considering the isospin symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, the excitation energy can be calculated using the difference in the Coulomb energies between the two nuclei. The Coulomb energy for a nucleus is approximately E_C = (3/5) * (e²/(4πε₀)) * (Z² - Z)/R. The difference in Coulomb energy between the parent (^81Br, Z=35) and the IAS in ^81Kr (Z=36) would be:\n\nΔE_C ≈ (3/5)*(e²/(4πε₀)) * [ (36² -36) - (35² -35) ] / R\n\nCompute this:\n\n36² -36 = 1296 -36=1260\n\n35² -35=1225 -35=1190\n\nDifference=1260 -1190=70\n\nSo ΔE_C ≈ (3/5)*(1.44 MeV·fm) *70 / R\n\nR = r₀ A^(1/3) = 1.2 fm *81^(1/3). 81^(1/3)=4.326, so R≈1.2*4.326≈5.191 fm.\n\nThus,\n\nΔE_C ≈ (3/5)*(1.44 MeV·fm)*70 /5.191 fm ≈ (3/5)*(1.44*70)/5.191 ≈ (3/5)*(100.8)/5.191 ≈ (60.48)/5.191≈11.65 MeV.\n\nBut this is a rough estimate. However, another approach is to use the mass excess difference. The parent is ^81Br with mass excess -77.98 MeV. The IAS in ^81Kr would have a mass excess given by:\n\nΔM_IAS = ΔM_parent + (M_n - M_p) + ΔE_Coulomb\n\nWait, but perhaps a better way is to consider the difference in mass excess between the parent and the IAS. The IAS in ^81Kr is the analog of ^81Br, so the mass difference should account for the difference in Coulomb energy and the neutron-proton mass difference.\n\nAlternatively, the excitation energy E_x is given by:\n\nE_x = [M(^81Kr) - M(^81Br)] + (m_n - m_p) + ΔE_Coulomb\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula for the excitation energy of the IAS is approximately:\n\nE_x ≈ ΔM(^81Kr) - ΔM(^81Br) + (m_n - m_p)c²\n\nBut wait, the mass excess ΔM is already given in the table. Let's check the values.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n^81Br: ΔM = -77.98 MeV\n\n^81Kr: ΔM = -77.65 MeV\n\nSo the difference in mass excess is (-77.65) - (-77.98) = 0.33 MeV. But this is the mass difference between ^81Kr and ^81Br. However, the IAS in ^81Kr is an excited state, so its mass should be higher than the ground state of ^81Kr. Wait, but the ground state of ^81Kr has ΔM=-77.65 MeV. The IAS would be an excited state, so its mass would be higher, i.e., ΔM_IAS = ΔM(^81Kr_gs) + E_x. But how to relate this to the parent nucleus ^81Br.\n\nAlternatively, the excitation energy E_x is the difference in energy between the IAS in ^81Kr and the ground state of ^81Kr. To compute this, we can use the relation:\n\nE_x = [M(^81Br) - M(^81Kr)]c² + (m_n - m_p)c² + ΔE_Coulomb\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think differently. The IAS in ^81Kr corresponds to the state where a proton is changed to a neutron compared to ^81Br. So the mass difference should account for the proton-neutron mass difference and the Coulomb energy.\n\nThe mass of the IAS in ^81Kr would be M(^81Br) - m_p + m_n - ΔE_Coulomb/c². Therefore, the excitation energy E_x is:\n\nE_x = [M(^81Br) - m_p + m_n - M(^81Kr_gs)]c² - ΔE_Coulomb\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Alternatively, using the formula from nuclear physics: the excitation energy of the IAS is approximately equal to the Coulomb displacement energy, which is roughly 0.7 MeV per proton in excess of the daughter nucleus. Wait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the Coulomb displacement energy between mirror nuclei is approximately ΔE_C ≈ 1.44*(Z+1) / (1.2*A^(1/3)) ) MeV. For example, for ^81Br (Z=35) and ^81Kr (Z=36), A=81. So ΔE_C ≈ 1.44*(36)/(1.2*81^(1/3)) ). Let's compute:\n\n81^(1/3)≈4.326, so denominator=1.2*4.326≈5.191\n\nNumerator=1.44*36≈51.84\n\nΔE_C≈51.84/5.191≈9.98 MeV. Approximately 10 MeV.\n\nBut this is a rough estimate. However, looking at the mass excess difference between ^81Br and ^81Kr: ΔM(Kr) - ΔM(Br) = (-77.65) - (-77.98) = 0.33 MeV. So the ground state of ^81Kr is 0.33 MeV higher than ^81Br. But the IAS is an excited state in ^81Kr, so the excitation energy would be the Coulomb displacement energy minus this mass difference. Wait, perhaps the excitation energy is the Coulomb energy minus the mass difference. But I'm getting confused. Let me look for a formula.\n\nThe excitation energy of the IAS can be estimated using:\n\nE_x ≈ ΔM_child - ΔM_parent + (m_n - m_p) + ΔE_Coulomb\n\nBut m_n - m_p is about 1.293 MeV (since neutron is heavier than proton by about 1.293 MeV). But wait, m_n = 939.565 MeV/c², m_p = 938.272 MeV/c², so difference is ~1.293 MeV.\n\nBut the mass excesses already include the masses of the nucleons. Wait, the mass excess ΔM is defined such that M = A*931.5 MeV + ΔM. So the actual mass of the nucleus is M = A*931.5 + ΔM. Therefore, the difference in mass between ^81Br and ^81Kr is:\n\nM(^81Kr) - M(^81Br) = [81*931.5 + (-77.65)] - [81*931.5 + (-77.98)] = (-77.65 +77.98) = 0.33 MeV.\n\nSo ^81Kr is 0.33 MeV heavier than ^81Br. But the IAS in ^81Kr is obtained by changing a neutron in ^81Br to a proton (via the isospin raising operator), which would increase the Coulomb energy. The excitation energy should be approximately the Coulomb displacement energy plus the mass difference.\n\nWait, but the Coulomb energy in ^81Kr is higher than in ^81Br. So the IAS should be higher in energy by the Coulomb displacement energy. However, the ground state of ^81Kr is already 0.33 MeV heavier than ^81Br. So the excitation energy of the IAS would be the Coulomb displacement energy minus this mass difference. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the excitation energy is given by:\n\nE_x = [M(^81Br) + m_p - m_n - M(^81Kr)]c² + ΔE_Coulomb\n\nBut this is getting too involved. Let me think of another approach. The IAS is at an excitation energy such that:\n\nE_x = Q_EC - (M_child - M_parent)c²\n\nWhere Q_EC is the Q-value for electron capture. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the excitation energy can be approximated by the difference in the Coulomb energies between the parent and daughter nuclei. For ^81Br (Z=35) and ^81Kr (Z=36), the Coulomb energy difference is:\n\nΔE_C = (3/5)(e²/(4πε₀))*(Z_kr² - Z_br²)/R\n\nBut Z_kr=36, Z_br=35. So:\n\nΔE_C = (3/5)(1.44 MeV·fm)(36² -35²)/R\n\n36² -35² = (36-35)(36+35)=1*71=71\n\nR = 1.2*A^(1/3) =1.2*81^(1/3)=1.2*4.326≈5.191 fm\n\nSo ΔE_C = (3/5)(1.44)(71)/5.191 ≈ (3/5)(102.24)/5.191 ≈ (61.344)/5.191≈11.81 MeV.\n\nBut the ground state of ^81Kr is already 0.33 MeV heavier than ^81Br, so the excitation energy would be ΔE_C - 0.33 MeV ≈11.81 -0.33≈11.48 MeV. But this is a rough estimate. However, typical Coulomb displacement energies are around 5-10 MeV for medium-heavy nuclei. Maybe this estimate is too high. Alternatively, using a different formula.\n\nAnother approach: The Coulomb displacement energy between isobaric analog states can be approximated by:\n\nΔE_C ≈ 1.44 * Z * (Z+1) / (A^(1/3)) ) * (1/(4πε₀)) * (3/5) * (1/(1.2)) )\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nΔE_C ≈ (3/5) * (e²/(4πε₀)) * (Z(Z-1)/A^(1/3)) )\n\nBut for the difference between Z and Z+1, it's complicated. Alternatively, the difference in Coulomb energy between Z and Z+1 is approximately:\n\nΔE_C ≈ (3/5)(e²/(4πε₀)) * ( (Z+1)Z - Z(Z-1) ) / (r₀ A^(1/3)) )\n\n= (3/5)(1.44 MeV·fm) * (2Z) / (1.2 fm A^(1/3)) )\n\n= (3/5)(1.44)(2Z)/(1.2 A^(1/3)) )\n\n= (3/5)(1.44)(2*35)/(1.2*81^(1/3)) )\n\nWait, Z=35 for ^81Br, and Z+1=36 for ^81Kr.\n\nSo:\n\nΔE_C ≈ (3/5)*(1.44 MeV·fm)*(2*35)/(1.2*4.326 fm)\n\n= (3/5)*(1.44)*(70)/(5.1912)\n\n= (3/5)*(100.8)/5.1912\n\n= (60.48)/5.1912 ≈11.65 MeV.\n\nAgain, similar to before. So the excitation energy is approximately 11.65 MeV. But considering the mass difference of 0.33 MeV (since ^81Kr is heavier), the actual excitation energy would be this Coulomb energy minus the mass difference. Wait, no. The IAS is an excited state in ^81Kr, so its mass is higher than the ground state. The mass difference between ^81Br and ^81Kr is 0.33 MeV, but the Coulomb energy needed to raise the proton number would add to the excitation.

{"id": "atomic/1-33", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the average speed of an electron in the first Bohr orbit of an atom with atomic number Z, and express it in terms of the velocity of light. The options are given as (a) Z^(1/2), (b) Z, (c) Z/137. Let me recall the Bohr model of the atom. \n\nFrom what I remember, Bohr's model describes the electron orbiting the nucleus in specific energy levels without emitting radiation. The speed of the electron in these orbits can be derived using the quantization of angular momentum. \n\nThe key formulas in the Bohr model are the ones for the radius of the nth orbit and the velocity of the electron in that orbit. Let me try to remember them. \n\nThe radius of the nth Bohr orbit is given by r_n = (n² * ε₀ * h²) / (π * Z * e² * m_e), where ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, h is Planck's constant, e is the elementary charge, m_e is the electron mass, and Z is the atomic number. But maybe there's a simpler expression when considering the first orbit (n=1). \n\nAlternatively, the velocity of the electron in the nth orbit is given by v = (Z * e²) / (2 ε₀ h) * (1/n). Wait, I think there's a more precise formula. Let me check. \n\nIn the Bohr model, the angular momentum is quantized: m_e * v_n * r_n = n * h/(2π). Then, using Coulomb's law for the centripetal force: (Z e²)/(4π ε₀ r_n²) = m_e v_n² / r_n. \n\nSo combining these two equations. Let's write them down:\n\n1. Coulomb force provides centripetal acceleration: (Z e²)/(4π ε₀ r_n²) = m_e v_n² / r_n. Simplifying, (Z e²)/(4π ε₀ r_n) = m_e v_n².\n\n2. Quantization of angular momentum: m_e v_n r_n = n h/(2π). \n\nSo from equation 2, we can solve for r_n: r_n = (n h)/(2π m_e v_n). Substitute this into equation 1. \n\nSubstituting r_n into equation 1:\n\n(Z e²)/(4π ε₀) * (2π m_e v_n)/(n h) ) = m_e v_n².\n\nWait, let me do that substitution step by step. \n\nEquation 1 after substitution:\n\n(Z e²)/(4π ε₀) * 1/r_n = m_e v_n².\n\nBut r_n from equation 2 is (n h)/(2π m_e v_n). So 1/r_n = (2π m_e v_n)/(n h). \n\nTherefore, substituting into equation 1:\n\n(Z e²)/(4π ε₀) * (2π m_e v_n)/(n h) ) = m_e v_n².\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n(Z e² * 2π m_e v_n) / (4π ε₀ n h) ) = m_e v_n².\n\nCancel out terms. The 2π in the numerator and 4π in the denominator gives 1/(2). So:\n\n(Z e² m_e v_n) / (2 ε₀ n h) ) = m_e v_n².\n\nDivide both sides by m_e v_n (assuming v_n ≠ 0):\n\n(Z e²) / (2 ε₀ n h) ) = v_n.\n\nSo v_n = (Z e²)/(2 ε₀ n h).\n\nNow, let's plug in the constants to find the velocity in terms of the speed of light. \n\nBut I remember that the fine-structure constant α is defined as α = e²/(4π ε₀ ħ c), where ħ = h/(2π). Let's see if we can express v_n in terms of α. \n\nFirst, let's compute v_n. For the first orbit, n=1. So:\n\nv_1 = (Z e²)/(2 ε₀ h).\n\nBut h = 2π ħ, so substituting:\n\nv_1 = (Z e²)/(2 ε₀ * 2π ħ) ) = (Z e²)/(4π ε₀ ħ * 1).\n\nBut α = e²/(4π ε₀ ħ c), so solving for e²/(4π ε₀ ħ) = α c. Therefore, substituting back into v_1:\n\nv_1 = Z * α c / 1.\n\nSo v_1 = Z α c. \n\nSince α is approximately 1/137, then v_1 ≈ Z * (1/137) * c. Therefore, the speed in terms of the speed of light is Z/137. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be option (c) Z/137.\n\nWait, let me verify the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting from v_n = (Z e²)/(2 ε₀ n h). For n=1, that's (Z e²)/(2 ε₀ h). Then, express h as 2π ħ, so substituting:\n\nv_1 = (Z e²)/(2 ε₀ * 2π ħ) ) = (Z e²)/(4π ε₀ ħ). \n\nThen, since α = e²/(4π ε₀ ħ c), rearranged gives e²/(4π ε₀ ħ) = α c. Therefore, substituting into v_1:\n\nv_1 = Z * α c. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the velocity is Z times α times c. Since α ≈ 1/137, then v_1 ≈ Z * (1/137) * c. Therefore, the speed in units of c is Z/137. \n\nSo the answer is (c) Z/137. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me check if there's another way to get the same result. \n\nAlternatively, the speed of the electron in the first Bohr orbit of hydrogen (Z=1) is known to be approximately c/137, which is about 2.2*10^6 m/s. So for hydrogen, Z=1, so the speed is 1/137 times c. Therefore, generalizing for any Z, it's Z times that, so Z/137. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer is (c).\n</think>\n\nThe average speed of an electron in the first Bohr orbit of an atom with atomic number \\( Z \\) can be derived using the Bohr model.

{"id": "atomic/2-3", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle part (a) first. The question is about the criteria for selecting a probe to study nuclear size, shape, and density distribution. Hmm, I remember that when probing nuclei, the probe particles need to interact with the nucleus in a way that reveals its structure. So, the main factors would probably involve the probe's wavelength, interaction strength, and maybe energy.\n\nWait, the de Broglie wavelength comes into play here. For a probe to resolve nuclear features, its wavelength should be comparable to or smaller than the size of the nucleus. Since wavelength λ is h/(mv), higher energy particles have shorter wavelengths, allowing better resolution. So one criterion is the probe's wavelength needing to be small enough to resolve the nucleus.\n\nAnother thing is the type of interaction. Electrons interact via the electromagnetic force, which is good because it's well-understood, and their scattering can give precise charge distribution. Protons also interact electromagnetically but have strong interactions too, which might complicate things. Neutrons, being neutral, interact via the strong force, so they probe the nuclear matter distribution but maybe have different cross-sections. So the interaction mechanism is another criterion—whether you want electromagnetic or strong force interactions.\n\nAlso, the energy of the probe matters. High-energy probes can penetrate the nucleus and provide information about internal structure, while low-energy might only give surface details. But too high energy might cause other reactions, like particle creation, which could be a problem. So energy must be optimized to avoid such issues while still getting the necessary resolution.\n\nThen there's the issue of cross-section. The probe should have a significant probability of interacting with the nucleus. If the cross-section is too small, the signal might be too weak. Electrons have a known cross-section via EM interactions, which is calculable. Protons and neutrons have larger cross-sections due to strong interactions, but that might lead to multiple scattering events, complicating the data interpretation. So cross-section and the resulting signal clarity are important.\n\nAlso, maybe the ability to perform elastic vs. inelastic scattering. For studying static properties like size and shape, elastic scattering is more relevant. The probe should preferably undergo elastic scattering without transferring too much energy, so that the nucleus isn't excited or broken apart. So maybe the probe's ability to induce elastic rather than inelastic collisions is a factor.\n\nPutting this together, the criteria would be:\n\n1. Wavelength of the probe (resolution capability).\n2. Type of interaction (electromagnetic vs. strong) to target charge or matter distribution.\n3. Energy of the probe (sufficient to resolve features without causing unwanted reactions).\n4. Interaction cross-section (sufficient signal without excessive multiple scattering).\n5. Elastic scattering preference to avoid nuclear excitation.\n\nFor part (b), comparing electrons, protons, and neutrons. Electrons are good because they interact via EM, which is well-understood, and their scattering (like in electron scattering experiments) gives precise charge distribution. But since they don't feel the strong force, they don't probe the nuclear matter (neutrons and protons) distribution directly. Protons, being charged, also interact via EM but have strong interactions as well. So proton scattering can give info on both charge and matter distribution, but strong interactions complicate the analysis because they're harder to model. Neutrons, being neutral, interact only via strong force, so they probe the nuclear matter distribution. However, neutron beams are harder to produce and control compared to electrons and protons. Also, neutrons have a short range interaction, so maybe their cross-sections are more dependent on the nuclear density. Electrons have the advantage of being point particles, so their scattering patterns can be more directly interpreted using QED. Protons and neutrons, being composite, might have form factors themselves, which complicates the analysis. So electrons are better for charge distribution, protons might give a mix, and neutrons for matter distribution. But each has pros and cons in terms of beam availability, interaction models, and data interpretation.\n\nFor part (c), using photons. Photons also interact electromagnetically. High-energy photons (like gamma rays) could be used. But the problem is that photons are bosons and might have different interaction mechanisms. For example, photonuclear reactions could be induced. However, the wavelength of photons at suitable energies might be appropriate. But compared to electrons, photons have the issue that their interaction cross-sections with nuclei are generally smaller, making experiments harder. Also, photons can be absorbed or cause pair production at high energies. Additionally, the scattering of photons (Compton scattering) might not provide as clear information as electron scattering. But maybe using virtual photons in electron scattering is already a method. Alternatively, using photons for studying nuclear structure might be less direct. However, in some cases, photon scattering (such as in (γ, γ') reactions) can provide information on nuclear excitations, but perhaps not the static properties like size and shape as effectively as electrons. So my opinion is that photons are less ideal compared to electrons for probing nuclear size and shape because of lower cross-sections and more complex interactions, but they might have niche applications.\n</think>\n\n(a) The criteria for selecting a probe to study nuclear properties include:  \n1. **Wavelength**: The probe's de Broglie wavelength must be smaller than the nuclear size to resolve spatial features.  \n2. **Interaction type**: Electromagnetic probes (electrons) reveal charge distribution, while strong-force probes (neutrons/protons) reveal matter distribution.  \n3. **Energy**: Sufficient energy to penetrate the nucleus without inducing secondary reactions (e.g., particle creation).  \n4. **Cross-section**: Adequate interaction probability for detectable signals, balanced against complications from multiple scattering.  \n5. **Elastic scattering preference**: Minimizing inelastic processes ensures static property measurements.  \n\n(b) **Comparison of probes**:  \n- **Electrons**:  \n  *Advantages*: Point-like, precise charge distribution via well-understood electromagnetic interactions.  \n  *Disadvantages*: Insensitive to nuclear matter distribution (no strong interaction).  \n- **Protons**:  \n  *Advantages*: Probe both charge and matter distribution (via EM and strong forces).  \n  *Disadvantages*: Composite structure complicates analysis; strong interactions lead to complex scattering.  \n- **Neutrons**:  \n  *Advantages*: Directly probe nuclear matter distribution via strong force.  \n  *Disadvantages*: Difficult to produce controlled beams; short-range interactions complicate interpretation.  \n\n(c) **Photons**: While photons interact electromagnetically, their use is limited by lower cross-sections and challenges in isolating static nuclear properties. High-energy photons may induce pair production or absorption, complicating measurements. Photon scattering (e.g., Compton scattering) is less direct than electron scattering for size/shape studies. However, photons can probe nuclear excitations in specific cases.  \n\nFinal Answers:  \n(a) Key criteria:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Wavelength, interaction type, energy, cross-section, and elastic scattering preference}}\n\\]  \n(b) Probe comparison:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Electrons: charge distribution;

{"id": "atomic/2-4", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the accuracy of treating a deformed nucleus as a point charge when calculating the electric potential at the first Bohr radius. The nucleus is an ellipsoid with the long axis 10% longer than the short axis. Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic concepts.\n\nFirst, the electric potential of a point charge is V_point = kQ/r, where Q is the charge, r is the distance from the charge, and k is Coulomb's constant. For a non-point charge, like an extended nucleus, the potential will differ, especially if the charge distribution isn't spherically symmetric. Since the nucleus is an ellipsoid, which is a bit stretched, the potential might have a quadrupole term or higher-order multipole moments.\n\nBut the question is about the accuracy when approximating it as a point charge. So, the main error would come from neglecting the multipole expansion terms beyond the monopole (which is the point charge term). The leading correction would be the quadrupole term because the nucleus is ellipsoidal, which introduces a quadrupole moment.\n\nThe quadrupole term in the multipole expansion falls off as 1/r^3, whereas the monopole term (point charge) falls off as 1/r. So, the relative error due to the quadrupole term would be roughly (quadrupole term / monopole term) = (Q_quadrupole * 1/r^3) / (Q_monopole * 1/r) ) = (Q_quadrupole / Q_monopole) * (1/r^2).\n\nBut wait, the quadrupole moment itself depends on the charge distribution. For an ellipsoid, the quadrupole moment Q can be approximated. The quadrupole moment is usually given by something like Q = (2/5)Z e (a^2 - b^2), where a and b are the semi-axes lengths, Z is the atomic number, and e is the elementary charge. Since the long axis is 10% longer than the short axis, let's say the short axis is 'b', then the long axis is 'a = 1.1b'. So, a^2 - b^2 = (1.21b^2 - b^2) = 0.21b^2. Therefore, Q ≈ (2/5) Z e * 0.21 b^2 = 0.084 Z e b^2.\n\nBut the monopole moment is just Q_monopole = Z e. So, the ratio Q_quadrupole / Q_monopole would be 0.084 b^2. But we need to relate this to the potential. Wait, the quadrupole term in the potential is something like (1/(4πε0)) * (Q_quadrupole) * (3 cos²θ - 1)/(2 r^3). So, the maximum contribution would be when the angular terms are of order 1. So, the quadrupole potential V_quad ≈ (1/(4πε0)) * (Q_quadrupole) / r^3. The monopole potential V_mono = (1/(4πε0)) * Q_monopole / r. So, the ratio V_quad / V_mono ≈ (Q_quadrupole / Q_monopole) * (1 / r^2).\n\nPlugging in Q_quadrupole / Q_monopole ≈ 0.084 b^2. But here, 'b' is the semi-minor axis of the nucleus. Wait, but the Bohr radius is much larger than the nuclear radius. The Bohr radius is about 0.5 angstroms (5e-11 m), while the nuclear radius is on the order of femtometers (1e-15 m). So, the ratio (b / r) is like (1e-15 m / 5e-11 m) = 2e-5. Therefore, (b / r)^2 ≈ 4e-10. Then, the ratio V_quad / V_mono ≈ 0.084 * 4e-10 ≈ 3.36e-11. That's a very small number, so the error would be about 3e-11, or 0.00000000336%, which seems way too small. But maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. The quadrupole moment for a nucleus is often given as Q = (3/(5(1 + 0.1))) ) * Z e R^2 * ( (a - b)/R ), where R is the mean radius. Wait, maybe another approach. Let's recall that the quadrupole moment for a uniformly charged ellipsoid with semi-major axis a and semi-minor axis b (assuming prolate spheroid) is Q = (2/5) Z e (a^2 - b^2). If a is 10% longer than b, then a = 1.1b. Then, a^2 - b^2 = (1.21b^2 - b^2) = 0.21b^2. So, Q = (2/5) Z e * 0.21b^2 = 0.084 Z e b^2. So, the quadrupole moment is proportional to Z e b^2 times 0.084.\n\nNow, the potential due to a quadrupole at a point along the symmetry axis (which would give the maximum contribution) is V_quad = (1/(4πε0)) * (Q) / (2 r^3). So, the ratio of V_quad to V_monopole (which is (1/(4πε0)) * Z e / r ) is (Q/(2 r^3)) / (Z e / r ) ) = Q/(2 Z e r^2 ). Substituting Q = 0.084 Z e b^2, this becomes (0.084 Z e b^2 ) / (2 Z e r^2 ) ) = 0.042 (b^2 / r^2 ). So, the relative error is approximately 0.042 * (b/r)^2.\n\nNow, the nuclear radius b is approximately given by the formula for nuclear radius: R = r0 A^(1/3), where r0 ≈ 1.2 fm, and A is the mass number. But since the nucleus is deformed, maybe we can take an average radius. Let's assume a typical nucleus, say, for hydrogen, but hydrogen's nucleus is a proton, which is point-like. Maybe take a medium-sized nucleus, like, say, Carbon-12. A = 12, so R ≈ 1.2 * 12^(1/3) ≈ 1.2 * 2.289 ≈ 2.75 fm. But in this case, the ellipsoid has a long axis 10% longer. So, if the short axis is b, then a = 1.1b. The volume of an ellipsoid is (4/3)π a b^2. For a sphere, volume is (4/3)π R^3. So, equate the volumes if we want to compare to a spherical nucleus. Let's say the volume of the ellipsoid is same as a sphere of radius R. Then, (4/3)π a b^2 = (4/3)π R^3 ⇒ a b^2 = R^3. Given a = 1.1b, then 1.1b * b^2 = 1.1 b^3 = R^3 ⇒ b = (R^3 / 1.1)^(1/3) ≈ R / (1.1)^(1/3) ≈ R / 1.032, so b ≈ 0.97 R. So, the semi-minor axis is about 0.97 R. But maybe this is complicating things. Alternatively, take the radius of the nucleus as roughly R ≈ 1.2 A^(1/3) fm. Let's say A is around, say, 100 (a medium-heavy nucleus), then R ≈ 1.2 * 100^(1/3) ≈ 1.2 * 4.64 ≈ 5.57 fm. So, R ≈ 5.57 fm. Then, the semi-minor axis b would be approximately R (since the ellipsoid's volume is same as sphere of radius R), but with a = 1.1b. So, as before, b ≈ R / (1.1)^(1/3) ≈ 5.57 fm / 1.032 ≈ 5.4 fm. So, b ≈ 5.4 fm. Then, (b/r)^2 where r is the Bohr radius, which is about 5.29e-11 meters = 52900 fm. So, b = 5.4 fm, r = 52900 fm. Then, (b/r) = 5.4 / 52900 ≈ 1.02e-4. Then, (b/r)^2 ≈ 1.04e-8. Multiply by 0.042: 0.042 * 1.04e-8 ≈ 4.37e-10. So, the relative error is approximately 4.37e-10, which is 4.37e-8 percent. That's 0.0000000437%, which is extremely small. That seems way too small. But maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, but the quadrupole term is the first correction term beyond the monopole. If the nucleus is only 10% deformed, then the quadrupole moment is small compared to the monopole. But given that the nucleus is so small compared to the Bohr radius, the effect is negligible. So, the error in treating it as a point charge would be of the order (nuclear size / Bohr radius)^2 times the deformation factor. The deformation is 10%, so 0.1. So, the error would be roughly (R / a0)^2 * 0.1, where R is nuclear radius, a0 is Bohr radius. Let's compute R/a0. For R ≈ 5 fm = 5e-15 m, a0 ≈ 5e-11 m. So, R/a0 ≈ 1e-4. Then, (R/a0)^2 ≈ 1e-8. Multiply by 0.1 gives 1e-9. So, the relative error is about 1e-9, or 0.0000001%. That's 0.1 parts per billion. So, the accuracy would be about 1e-9, meaning the point charge approximation is accurate to about 1 part in a billion. But maybe this is an overestimate. Alternatively, perhaps the quadrupole term is of the order (R/a0)^2 * (deformation), which is (1e-4)^2 * 0.1 = 1e-9. So, same result. Therefore, the error is about 1e-9, so the accuracy is about 1 part in a billion. Therefore, treating the nucleus as a point charge would give an accuracy of approximately 99.9999999%. But maybe the actual answer is around 0.1% or something. Wait, but the numbers here are giving me a very small error. Let me check again.\n\nWait, another approach: The electric potential of a charged ellipsoid at a distance much larger than its size can be approximated as a point charge plus a quadrupole term. The quadrupole term is proportional to (Q * (3 cos²θ - 1) * (a^2 - b^2))/(4r^3). The leading term is the monopole, which is Q/(4πε0 r). The ratio of the quadrupole term to the monopole term is ( (a^2 - b^2) / r^2 ) * (3 cos²θ - 1)/2. For maximum effect, take (3 cos²θ -1) = 2 (along the symmetry axis). Then, the ratio becomes (a^2 - b^2)/r^2. Given that a = 1.1b, so a^2 - b^2 = (1.21b² - b²) = 0.21b². So, the ratio is 0.21b² / r². Then, the relative error is 0.21*(b/r)^2. If b is the semi-minor axis, which is approximately the radius of the nucleus. Let's take b ≈ 5 fm = 5e-15 m, r = Bohr radius ≈ 5e-11 m. Then, (b/r) = 5e-15 / 5e-11 = 1e-4. Then, (b/r)^2 = 1e-8. Multiply by 0.21: 0.21e-8 = 2.1e-9. So, the relative error is about 2.1e-9, or 0.00000021%. So, the accuracy is 1 - 2.1e-9 ≈ 0.999999998, so 99.9999998% accurate. Therefore, the error is on the order of 1e-9, so the accuracy is about 1 part in a billion. That seems extremely accurate. But is this correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the quadrupole term is of the order of (nuclear radius)^2 / (Bohr radius)^2 times the deformation. The deformation is 10%, so 0.1. Then, (1e-4)^2 * 0.1 = 1e-9. So, same as before. Therefore, the error is about 1e-9. So, the answer is that the accuracy is about 1 part in a billion, so the error is negligible. Therefore, treating the nucleus as a point charge is accurate to within approximately 0.0000001%, so the potential computed as a point charge would be accurate to about 1e-9 fractional error. Therefore, the answer should be that the accuracy is on the order of 1e-3 (0.1%) or 1e-9? Wait, but according to the calculation, it's 2.1e-9, which is 0.00000021, so 0.000021%. Wait, 2.1e-9 is 2.1 parts per billion. So, 0.00000021, which is 0.000021%. So, the accuracy is 99.999979%. So, the error is about 0.000021%. So, when the question asks \"what accuracy can you expect\", it's the error introduced by treating it as a point charge. So, the error is about 0.000021%, so the accuracy is 99.999979%. But maybe the problem expects a rougher estimate. For example, since the nucleus is much smaller than the Bohr radius, the multipole expansion converges rapidly. The first non-zero term after monopole is quadrupole (since dipole would be zero for a charge distribution with no net dipole moment, which is the case for a nucleus with symmetric proton distribution). So, the leading correction is quadrupole, which is of order (size)^2 / r^2. Given that size is ~1e-15 m, r ~1e-10 m (Bohr radius is ~5e-11 m), so (1e-15 / 1e-10)^2 = (1e-5)^2 = 1e-10. Multiply by the deformation factor of 10% (0.1), gives 1e-11. So, the relative error is ~1e-11, so accuracy is ~1 - 1e-11, which is 99.999999999% accurate. But this seems even smaller. Wait, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let's check:\n\nNuclear radius R ≈ 1e-15 m (for a small nucleus), Bohr radius a0 ≈ 5e-11 m. So, R/a0 ≈ 2e-5. Then, (R/a0)^2 ≈ 4e-10. Multiply by deformation 0.1: 4e-10 * 0.1 = 4e-11. So, relative error ~4e-11, which is 4e-9 percent. So, 0.00000004%. So, the accuracy is 99.99999996%. So, the error is negligible. Therefore, the answer is that the accuracy is extremely high, on the order of parts per billion, so treating the nucleus as a point charge introduces an error of approximately 0.00001% or less. Therefore, the accuracy is better than 0.001% (which is 1e-5), but according to the calculation, it's even smaller. However, the problem says \"make a reasonable estimate; do not get involved in integration\". So, maybe we can approximate the error as (deformation)*(nuclear size/Bohr radius)^2. Deformation is 10%, nuclear size ~1e-15 m, Bohr radius ~5e-11 m. So, (1e-15 / 5e-11) = 2e-5. Squared is 4e-10. Multiply by 0.1: 4e-11. So, 4e-11 is 4e-9 percent. So, the error is about 4e-9 percent, so the accuracy is 100% - 4e-9 percent, which is practically 100%. Therefore, the accuracy is very high, and the error is negligible. So, the answer is that the error is on the order of 1e-9, so the accuracy is about 99.9999999%. But the problem might expect a more rough estimate, like 1% or 0.1%, but according to the calculation, it's much smaller. Maybe the answer is approximately 0.01% accuracy, but I think the correct estimate is around 1e-4 to 1e-5 percent error. Wait, let's see:\n\nIf the deformation is 10%, then the quadrupole moment is proportional to that. The quadrupole term in the potential is Q/(r^3), compared to the monopole term which is Q/(r). So, the ratio is Q/(r^3) divided by Q/(r) = 1/r^2. But Q itself is proportional to the charge times the square of the size times the deformation. So, Q ~ Z e R^2 * (ΔR/R), where ΔR/R is the 10% deformation. Therefore, the quadrupole term is ~ (Z e R^2 ΔR/R) / r^3, and the monopole term is Z e / r. So, the ratio is (R^2 ΔR) / r^3. Plugging in R ~ 1e-15 m, ΔR ~ 0.1 R ~ 1e-16 m, r ~ 5e-11 m. Then, R^2 ΔR = (1e-15)^2 * 1e-16 = 1e-47 m^3. r^3 = (5e-11)^3 = 1.25e-31 m^3. So, the ratio is 1e-47 / 1.25e-31 = 8e-17. So, the relative error is 8e-17, which is 8e-15 percent. That's even smaller. But this seems inconsistent with previous calculations. Maybe this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quadrupole potential is given by (1/4πε0) * (Q_quadrupole) * (3 cos²θ - 1)/(4 r^3). The monopole term is (1/4πε0) * Q / r. So, the ratio is [Q_quadrupole * (3 cos²θ -1)/(4 r^3)] / [Q / r] = [Q_quadrupole / Q] * (3 cos²θ -1)/(4 r^2). Q_quadrupole for an ellipsoid is (2/5) Q (a^2 - b^2)/R^2, where R is the mean radius. If a = 1.1b, then a^2 - b^2 = 0.21b^2. Assuming R ≈ b (since a = 1.1b), then Q_quadrupole ≈ (2/5) Q * 0.21b^2 / b^2 = 0.084 Q. So, Q_quadrupole / Q ≈ 0.084. Then, the ratio becomes 0.084 * (3 cos²θ -1)/(4 r^2). Taking the maximum value when (3 cos²θ -1) = 2 (along the symmetry axis), then ratio ≈ 0.084 * 2 / (4 r^2) = 0.042 / r^2. Wait, but r is the distance from the nucleus, which is the Bohr radius, a0. So, the ratio is 0.042 * (R/a0)^2, where R is the nuclear radius. Wait, no, because Q_quadrupole is already proportional to R^2. Wait, maybe I need to express Q_quadrupole in terms of R. If the nucleus has a mean radius R, then for an ellipsoid with a = 1.1b, the volume is (4/3)π a b^2 = (4/3)π (1.1b) b^2 = (4/3)π 1.1 b^3. For a sphere of radius R, volume is (4/3)π R^3. Equating them: 1.1 b^3 = R^3 ⇒ b = (R^3 / 1.1)^(1/3) ≈ R / 1.032. So, b ≈ 0.97 R. Then, a = 1.1b ≈ 1.067 R. Then, a^2 - b^2 ≈ (1.067 R)^2 - (0.97 R)^2 ≈ (1.138 R² - 0.941 R²) ≈ 0.197 R². So, Q_quadrupole ≈ (2/5) Q * 0.197 R² ≈ 0.0788 Q R². Then, the ratio V_quad/V_mono ≈ (0.0788 Q R² / (4 r^3)) / (Q / r) ) = 0.0788 R² / (4 r^2) ≈ 0.0197 (R/r)^2. So, the relative error is approximately 2% * (R/r)^2. R is nuclear radius ~1e-15 m, r is Bohr radius ~5e-11 m. So, (R/r)^2 = (1e-15 / 5e-11)^2 = (2e-5)^2 = 4e-10. Multiply by 0.0197: 0.0197 * 4e-10 ≈ 7.88e-12. So, relative error ~8e-12, which is 8e-10 percent. So, accuracy is ~100% - 8e-10 percent. So, the error is negligible. Therefore, the conclusion is that the error introduced by treating the nucleus as a point charge is on the order of 1e-10 or smaller, so the accuracy is extremely high, better than 0.00000001%.\n\nBut the problem says \"make a reasonable estimate\". Given that the nucleus is much smaller than the Bohr radius, the leading correction is quadrupole, and the effect is of order (R/a0)^2 * deformation. R/a0 is ~1e-4, squared is 1e-8, multiplied by 0.1 deformation gives 1e-9. So, the relative error is ~1e-9, which is 0.0000001%. Therefore, the accuracy is 99.9999999%. So, the answer is that the accuracy is better than 0.0001%, but to give a rough estimate, maybe say the error is about 0.001%, but according to the calculation, it's much smaller. However, given that the problem asks for a reasonable estimate without detailed integration, perhaps the answer is approximately 0.1% accuracy. Wait, but 1e-9 is 0.0000001%, which is much smaller than 0.1%. Maybe the intended answer is around 0.1% to 1%, but according to the calculations, it's way smaller. Maybe the question expects considering the ratio of the nuclear quadrupole moment to the monopole term, but I think the correct answer based on the calculation is that the error is negligible, on the order of 1e-9, so the accuracy is extremely high. Therefore, the final answer is that the accuracy is better than 0.0001%, so the error is about 0.0001%, but according to the detailed calculation, it's even smaller. However, since the problem says \"make a reasonable estimate\", perhaps the answer is approximately 0.1% error, but I think the correct answer is much smaller. Given that, I'll go with the calculation result.\n</think>\n\nTo estimate the accuracy of treating the deformed nucleus as a point charge when calculating the electric potential at the first Bohr radius, we consider the leading correction from the quadrupole term in the multipole expansion. The nucleus is modeled as an ellipsoid with a 10% deformation (long axis 10% longer than the short axis). \n\n1. **Quadrupole Contribution**: The quadrupole potential scales as \\( \\frac{Q_{\\text{quad}}}{r^3} \\), while the monopole (point charge) potential scales as \\( \\frac{Q}{r} \\). The relative error is proportional to \\( \\frac{Q_{\\text{quad}}}{Q} \\cdot \\frac{1}{r^2} \\).\n\n2. **Quadrupole Moment**: For a 10% deformation, the quadrupole moment \\( Q_{\\text{quad}} \\approx 0.084 Q \\cdot R^2 \\), where \\( R \\) is the nuclear radius (~5 fm for a medium nucleus).\n\n3. **Nuclear vs. Bohr Radius**: The nuclear radius \\( R \\sim 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m} \\), and the Bohr radius \\( a_0 \\sim 5 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m} \\). The ratio \\( \\frac{R}{a_0} \\sim 2 \\times 10^{-5} \\), so \\( \\left(\\frac{R}{a_0}\\right)^2 \\sim 4 \\times 10^{-10} \\).\n\n4. **Relative Error**: Combining the deformation factor (0.1) and \\( \\left(\\frac{R}{a_0}\\right)^2 \\), the relative error is approximately:\n   \\[\n   0.1 \\times 4 \\times 10^{-10} = 4 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{(or 0.000000004%)}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, treating the nucleus as a point charge introduces an error of **~0.00000001%**, making the approximation extremely accurate. \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.00001\\%}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["0.00001\\%"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "0.00001\\%", "expr2": "\\Delta V \\approx 1 \\times 10^{-9}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": "I don't understand this\n0.00001\\%\n~~~~~~~^"}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-34", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to choose two experiments from the given options that were significant in the development of quantum theory. The options are Stern-Gerlach, Compton Effect, Franck-Hertz, and Lamb-Rutherford. Let me think about each one and what they contributed.\n\nStarting with the Stern-Gerlach experiment. I remember that this involved sending particles through an inhomogeneous magnetic field. The result was that the particles were split into discrete beams, which demonstrated spatial quantization. This supported the idea of quantized angular momentum, which is a key part of quantum mechanics. I think this was done in the early 1920s, maybe 1922. It showed that particles like electrons have intrinsic spin, even though at the time they might not have realized it was spin. Instead, they thought it was orbital angular momentum. But this experiment was important for showing quantization of angular momentum.\n\nNext, the Compton Effect. Arthur Compton observed that when X-rays scatter off electrons, their wavelength increases. This provided direct evidence for the particle nature of light, as photons transferring momentum to electrons. This was around 1923. The Compton Effect was crucial in confirming the photon concept from Einstein's work on the photoelectric effect. It supported the idea that light has both wave and particle properties, contributing to wave-particle duality in quantum theory.\n\nThe Franck-Hertz Experiment. This one involved electrons colliding with mercury atoms. They observed that electrons would lose energy in discrete amounts, which showed that atoms have quantized energy levels. This was around 1914. It provided experimental evidence for Bohr's model of the atom, which had quantized electron orbits. So this was important in validating the quantization of energy levels in atoms, a fundamental aspect of quantum theory.\n\nThe Lamb-Rutherford Experiment, I think, was later, maybe in the 1940s. It discovered the Lamb shift in the hydrogen spectrum, which was a small energy difference between certain orbitals. This couldn't be explained by the Dirac equation and led to the development of quantum electrodynamics (QED). So this experiment was important for QED, but maybe not as foundational for the initial development of quantum theory as the others.\n\nSo the question asks for two experiments that contributed to the development of quantum theory. The key here is to pick those that were pivotal in establishing core quantum concepts. Stern-Gerlach (a) and Compton (b) are both early experiments (1920s) that demonstrated quantization and particle aspects. Franck-Hertz (c) is also early (1914) and showed quantized energy levels. Lamb-Rutherford (d) is more about refining QED later.\n\nSo choosing between these, maybe Stern-Gerlach and Compton Effect, or Franck-Hertz and Compton. Let me check the dates. Franck-Hertz was 1914, Compton 1923, Stern-Gerlach 1922. All are in the early days of quantum theory. The Lamb-Rutherford is 1947, which is after the initial development of quantum mechanics (1925-1930). So for the development of quantum theory, the earlier experiments would be more significant.\n\nSo possible pairs: (a) and (b), or (a) and (c), or (b) and (c). Let me think about their contributions. Stern-Gerlach showed quantization of angular momentum, which relates to the quantum numbers and spin. Compton showed photon momentum, supporting particle nature. Franck-Hertz showed quantized energy levels. Both Franck-Hertz and Compton are about quantization but in different contexts. Stern-Gerlach is about spatial quantization.\n\nThe question says \"development of quantum theory\". The Franck-Hertz experiment was important for Bohr's model, which was part of the old quantum theory. The Compton Effect supported the photon concept, which was crucial for quantum theory. Stern-Gerlach's result was later understood in terms of electron spin, which became part of quantum mechanics. So maybe (a) and (b) are good choices. Alternatively, (b) and (c) since they both deal with quantization of energy and particle aspects.\n\nAlternatively, the Franck-Hertz experiment (1914) was earlier and provided evidence for Bohr's model, which was a key step in the development of quantum theory before the matrix mechanics etc. So perhaps (b) and (c) are better. Let me check the significance. The Compton Effect is definitely a major one because it confirmed the photon as a particle with momentum. The Franck-Hertz experiment showed quantized energy levels, which is fundamental. The Stern-Gerlach experiment showed quantization of angular momentum, which is also key.\n\nHmm. The question allows any two. Let me outline each:\n\n(a) Stern-Gerlach (1922): Showed that particles have quantized angular momentum, leading to the discovery of spin (though spin was proposed later). Contributed to the understanding of quantization in quantum mechanics.\n\n(b) Compton Effect (1923): Demonstrated the particle nature of light (photons) by showing wavelength shift in scattered X-rays, confirming photon momentum. Supported wave-particle duality.\n\n(c) Franck-Hertz (1914): Showed electrons transfer discrete energy to atoms, proving quantized energy levels in atoms. Supported Bohr's model.\n\n(d) Lamb-Rutherford (1947): Discovered Lamb shift, leading to QED.\n\nSo for the development of quantum theory, which includes the early stages (old quantum theory and transition to modern QM), (b) and (c) are both important. Alternatively, (a) and (b) or (a) and (c). The question asks for two, so I need to pick two and describe each.\n\nI think the best choices are (a) Stern-Gerlach and (b) Compton Effect, or (b) and (c). Let me check common knowledge. The Franck-Hertz experiment is often cited in textbooks as key evidence for quantized energy levels. The Compton Effect is also a standard example. Stern-Gerlach is also a classic experiment. So perhaps (b) and (c) would be the two. Alternatively, (a) and (b). Let me check the dates again. Franck-Hertz is 1914, which is before Compton (1923) and Stern-Gerlach (1922). So Franck-Hertz was earlier and contributed to Bohr's model, which was part of the old quantum theory. The Compton Effect was important in establishing the photon concept. Both are significant. Stern-Gerlach contributed to the understanding of spin and quantization of angular momentum, which was important for the development of quantum mechanics in the mid-1920s.\n\nSo perhaps (b) Compton Effect and (c) Franck-Hertz Experiment. Alternatively, (a) and (b). Let me think of the impact. The Franck-Hertz experiment directly showed that atoms absorb energy in quantized amounts, which was a key prediction of Bohr's model. The Compton Effect showed that light quanta have momentum, confirming Einstein's photon concept. Both are foundational. The Stern-Gerlach experiment's result was initially puzzling but later explained by electron spin, which became part of quantum mechanics. So maybe (b) and (c) are better choices here. Alternatively, (a) and (b) if focusing on angular momentum quantization and photon momentum.\n\nAlternatively, the question might expect (a) and (b) as answers. Let me recall common exam questions. The Stern-Gerlach experiment is often paired with spin, but in the original experiment, they used silver atoms and observed splitting into two beams, which was unexpected. This demonstrated spatial quantization, which was a key quantum concept. The Compton Effect is a standard answer for particle nature of light. So perhaps (a) and (b) are the two to choose. Let me confirm:\n\n(a) Stern-Gerlach (1922): Demonstrated spatial quantization of angular momentum, later understood as electron spin. Contributed to the concept of quantized angular momentum and spin in quantum mechanics.\n\n(b) Compton Effect (1923): Showed that photons carry momentum, confirming particle nature of light. Supported wave-particle duality and quantum theory's photon concept.\n\nThese two experiments are both significant in the development of quantum theory. So I'll choose (a) and (b). Alternatively, (b) and (c). But I need to decide. Let me check the contributions again.\n\nFranck-Hertz (1914): Showed that electrons colliding with mercury atoms transfer energy in discrete amounts, proving quantized energy levels. This was direct evidence for Bohr's atomic model, which was a major step in quantum theory.\n\nCompton (1923): Showed that X-rays scattering off electrons have increased wavelength, proving photon momentum. This confirmed the particle nature of light, essential for quantum theory.\n\nSo both (b) and (c) are important. The question allows any two, so either pair is acceptable. But the user might expect the two most significant. Alternatively, the answer could be (b) and (c). Let me check some sources. For example, the Franck-Hertz experiment is a standard part of quantum history, as is Compton. Stern-Gerlach is also important. So perhaps the best two are (b) Compton Effect and (c) Franck-Hertz. Alternatively, (a) and (b). Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says \"development of quantum theory\". The Franck-Hertz experiment (1914) was crucial in supporting Bohr's model (1913), which was part of the old quantum theory. The Compton Effect (1923) supported the photon concept, which was part of the emerging quantum theory. The Stern-Gerlach (1922) showed spatial quantization, which was a key quantum concept. The Lamb-Rutherford (1947) is more about QED.\n\nSo, if I have to choose two, perhaps (b) and (c) are better because they both deal with quantization of energy and particle aspects. Alternatively, (a) and (b) deal with angular momentum and photon momentum. But the user might expect (b) and (c). Alternatively, (a) and (c). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is (a) and (b). Let me check the original experiments' significance. The Stern-Gerlach experiment's result was a surprise and couldn't be explained classically, showing that angular momentum is quantized. This was a direct experimental proof of quantization in quantum mechanics. The Compton Effect showed the particle nature of light, which was a cornerstone of quantum theory. Both are very significant. Franck-Hertz is also important but maybe not as much as these two. Alternatively, all three are important, but the question asks for two. So I'll go with (a) Stern-Gerlach and (b) Compton Effect.\n</think>\n\nThe two significant experiments in the development of quantum theory are:\n\n**1.

{"id": "atomic/2-13", "solution": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out why the excitation energy for the lowest T=1 state is so different between Nitrogen-14 and Carbon-12. Both have ground states with isospin T=0, but their first T=1 states are at 2.3 MeV and 15 MeV respectively. Hmm, why the big difference?\n\nFirst, let me recall what isospin is. Isospin is a quantum number related to the symmetry between protons and neutrons. For a nucleus, the total isospin T depends on the number of protons (Z) and neutrons (N). The formula for the third component of isospin is T_z = (N - Z)/2. The total isospin T can be T ≥ |T_z|. So, for a nucleus with Z protons and N neutrons, T_z is (N-Z)/2, and the possible T values start from |T_z| upwards.\n\nIn the ground state, both ¹⁴₇N and ¹²₆C have T=0. That makes sense because for ¹⁴₇N, Z=7, N=7 (since 14-7=7), so T_z = (7-7)/2 = 0. So T must be at least 0, and here it's exactly 0. For ¹²₆C, Z=6, N=6 (12-6=6), so T_z is also 0. So their ground states are T=0.\n\nNow, the excited states with T=1. The question is why the energy required to reach the T=1 state is much lower in Nitrogen-14 than in Carbon-12. Let me think about the structure of these nuclei.\n\nIsospin is a symmetry that's more exact when the nuclear forces are charge-independent. But in reality, the Coulomb force between protons breaks this symmetry. So higher isospin states (like T=1) would involve configurations where the symmetry is restored to some extent, but the energy required depends on how easy it is for the nucleus to rearrange into such a state.\n\nIn the case of ¹⁴₇N, which has 7 protons and 7 neutrons, it's a N=Z nucleus. For such nuclei, the isospin symmetry is more pronounced. The ground state is T=0, and the excited T=1 states would form a triplet (since T=1 has three possible T_z values: -1, 0, +1). The other members of the triplet would be the neighboring isobars. For ¹⁴N, the T=1 triplet would include ¹⁴C (T_z = -1), ¹⁴N (T_z=0), and ¹⁴O (T_z=+1). These are isobars with the same mass number but different charges.\n\nSimilarly, for ¹²C (Z=6, N=6), the T=1 triplet would be ¹²B (T_z=-1), ¹²C (T_z=0), and ¹²N (T_z=+1). But here, the excitation energy to reach T=1 is much higher (15 MeV) compared to 2.3 MeV in ¹⁴N.\n\nWhy the difference? Maybe it's related to the stability of the nucleus and the energy required to form the isobaric analog states. For ¹⁴N, since it's a N=Z nucleus, the symmetry energy might be lower, making it easier to excite to a T=1 state. In contrast, ¹²C is a doubly magic nucleus (Z=6, N=6), which is very stable. The closed shells might make it harder to rearrange the nucleons into a higher isospin state, requiring more energy.\n\nWait, but ¹²C is also N=Z. So why would it be different? Maybe the shell structure plays a role here. Carbon-12 has a closed p-shell (since for Z=6, the 1p shell is filled), making it very tightly bound. The Pauli exclusion principle might make it harder to excite the nucleus into a state where protons and neutrons are rearranged in a way that increases the isospin. In contrast, Nitrogen-14 has an extra proton and neutron beyond the closed shell (since 7 protons and 7 neutrons would be in the 1p shell, which can hold up to 6 protons and 6 neutrons). So maybe the unpaired nucleons in ¹⁴N can be more easily rearranged into a T=1 configuration without requiring as much energy.\n\nAnother angle: the isospin triplet partners. For ¹⁴N, the T=1 state in ¹⁴N would have analogs in ¹⁴C and ¹⁴O. The energy difference between these isobars is influenced by the Coulomb energy. The Coulomb repulsion in ¹⁴O (which has 8 protons) is much higher than in ¹⁴C (6 protons). But the excitation energy in ¹⁴N is 2.3 MeV, which might be related to the energy required to overcome the symmetry energy and Coulomb effects to reach the T=1 state.\n\nIn contrast, for ¹²C, the T=1 state would correspond to ¹²B and ¹²N. ¹²B has 5 protons and 7 neutrons, while ¹²N has 7 protons and 5 neutrons. The Coulomb energy difference here is significant. However, since ¹²C is doubly magic, the energy required to break the strong binding and rearrange the nucleons into a higher isospin state is much higher. The closed shells in ¹²C make it more rigid, so exciting it to a T=1 state requires overcoming a larger energy gap.\n\nAdditionally, the concept of isobaric analog states: the T=1 state in ¹⁴N is the analog of the ground states of ¹⁴C and ¹⁴O. If the ground state of ¹⁴C is lower in energy, the excitation energy in ¹⁴N would be the difference due to the Coulomb shift. But how does that relate?\n\nThe Coulomb energy difference between isobars can be approximated by the formula ΔE_Coulomb ≈ (3e²/5r₀A^(1/3))(Z² - Z'²), where Z and Z' are the proton numbers of the two isobars. For ¹⁴N (Z=7) and ¹⁴O (Z=8), the Coulomb energy difference would be significant. However, the excitation energy in ¹⁴N to reach the T=1 state is 2.3 MeV, which might be related to the energy required to \"flip\" a proton to a neutron (or vice versa) in the nucleus, considering the symmetry energy and Coulomb effects.\n\nIn ¹²C, the T=1 state would correspond to a configuration where two nucleons are flipped (since T=1 requires a change in T_z by 1 unit, but maybe the actual configuration is more complex). But since ¹²C is so tightly bound, this requires a lot more energy.\n\nAnother thought: the Pauli exclusion principle. In ¹⁴N, which has an odd number of protons and neutrons (7 each), there are unpaired nucleons. This might allow for easier rearrangement into a T=1 state without violating the Pauli principle as much. In ¹²C, which is even-even and doubly magic, any excitation would require breaking pairs, which is more energetically costly.\n\nSo, the key factors are:\n\n1. **Shell Structure**: ¹²C is doubly magic, making it more stable and requiring more energy to excite. ¹⁴N is not magic, so it's easier to excite.\n\n2. **Pairing Energy**: Even-even nuclei like ¹²C have pairing energy gains, so breaking pairs costs energy. ¹⁴N is odd-odd, so it might have less pairing energy to overcome.\n\n3. **Coulomb Energy**: The T=1 states involve higher proton numbers (like in ¹⁴O), which have higher Coulomb energy. However, the excitation energy in the parent nucleus (¹⁴N) might be lower because the symmetry energy (which favors T=0) is weaker compared to the Coulomb effects. Wait, but how does symmetry energy play in?\n\nSymmetry energy in the nucleus penalizes asymmetry in the number of protons and neutrons. For N=Z nuclei, the symmetry energy is minimized. When you have a T=1 state, you're moving away from N=Z in the isobaric partners. But in the parent nucleus (which is N=Z), the T=1 state would correspond to a configuration that's more symmetric in isospin space but might involve higher symmetry energy in the actual nucleus. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, the isospin T=1 state in ¹⁴N is an isobaric analog of the ground states of ¹⁴C and ¹⁴O. The energy difference between these states is due to the Coulomb displacement. The excitation energy in ¹⁴N would then be related to the Coulomb energy difference between the parent and the analog state. For example, the ground state of ¹⁴O is higher in energy due to more protons, so the analog state in ¹⁴N would be at an energy determined by the Coulomb shift. If the Coulomb energy difference is about 2.3 MeV, that could explain the excitation energy. But why is it lower than in ¹²C?\n\nWait, maybe the Coulomb energy difference scales with Z² - Z'². For ¹⁴N (Z=7) and ¹⁴O (Z=8), the difference is 8² -7² = 64 -49 =15. For ¹²C (Z=6) and ¹²N (Z=7), it's 7² -6²=49-36=13. Wait, but the Coulomb energy formula is proportional to Z², so the difference would be (Z+1)² - Z² = 2Z+1. For ¹⁴O compared to ¹⁴N, Z=7 to 8: 2*7 +1=15. For ¹²N compared to ¹²C, Z=6 to7: 2*6 +1=13. So the Coulomb energy difference is actually larger for ¹⁴N's triplet. But the excitation energy is lower. That seems contradictory. So maybe the Coulomb energy isn't the main factor here.\n\nAlternatively, the symmetry energy, which is part of the semi-empirical mass formula, could be playing a role. The symmetry energy term is proportional to (N-Z)²/A. For N=Z, this term is zero. In the T=1 state, even though the parent nucleus is N=Z, the isospin state would correspond to a configuration where (N-Z) is different. Wait, but T=1 allows for T_z = -1, 0, +1. For the T=1, T_z=0 state in ¹⁴N, it's still N=Z. So maybe the symmetry energy isn't the issue here.\n\nAlternatively, the energy required to reach the T=1 state is related to the energy needed to break the T=0 configuration. In ¹⁴N, which is an odd-odd nucleus, the ground state might have a lower energy due to pairing, but the T=1 state could be a different configuration that's not as penalized. In ¹²C, which is even-even, the ground state is more tightly bound, so the T=1 state is much higher.\n\nAnother point: the spatial wavefunction symmetry. For T=1, the isospin part is symmetric, so the spatial part must be antisymmetric (since the total wavefunction for identical fermions must be antisymmetric). In nuclei, this might mean that the spatial configuration for T=1 states is more stretched or deformed, requiring more energy. But why would this affect ¹²C more than ¹⁴N?\n\nAlternatively, considering that ¹²C has a very compact and stable structure (like the alpha cluster model), any excitation that disrupts this structure would require significant energy. The T=1 state might involve breaking the alpha clusters, which is energetically costly. In contrast, ¹⁴N might have a less rigid structure, making such excitations easier.\n\nAlso, the Pauli exclusion principle: in ¹²C, all the nucleons are in filled shells, so any excitation would require promoting a nucleon across a shell gap, which is high energy. In ¹⁴N, which is already in the middle of the p-shell, excitations within the same shell are possible with lower energy.\n\nSo putting it all together, the main reasons for the difference in excitation energies are:\n\n1. **Shell Structure**: ¹²C is doubly magic, requiring more energy to excite due to closed shells. ¹⁴N is not magic, so excitations are easier.\n\n2. **Pairing Energy**: ¹²C is even-even with strong pairing, so breaking pairs costs more energy. ¹⁴N is odd-odd, so pairing effects are less significant.\n\n3. **Cluster Structure**: ¹²C's alpha-cluster structure is very stable, making excitations more energy-intensive. ¹⁴N's structure is less rigid.\n\nThe basis for ascribing T values to nuclear states is the isospin symmetry in nuclear forces. States with the same T form multiplets (like triplets for T=1) across isobars. The energy differences within the multiplet are due to Coulomb interactions and mass differences. By observing these analog states in neighboring nuclei and their energy differences, we can assign T values based on their systematic properties and how they fit into the isospin multiplet.\n</think>\n\nThe marked difference in excitation energies for the lowest \\( T = 1 \\) states in \\(^{14}_{7}\\text{N}\\) (2.3 MeV) and \\(^{12}_{6}\\text{C}\\) (15.0 MeV) arises from structural and symmetry-related factors:\n\n1. **Shell Structure and Stability**:\n   - \\(^{12}_{6}\\text{C}\\) is a doubly magic nucleus (\\(Z = 6\\), \\(N = 6\\)) with closed \\(1p_{3/2}\\) shells. Its rigid, tightly bound structure requires significant energy to disrupt, making excitations to \\(T = 1\\) states energetically costly.\n   - \\(^{14}_{7}\\text{N}\\) is not magic. With unpaired protons and neutrons in the \\(1p_{1/2}\\) shell, its structure is less rigid, allowing easier rearrangement into \\(T = 1\\) configurations.\n\n2. **Pairing Effects**:\n   - \\(^{12}_{6}\\text{C}\\) is even-even, benefiting from strong pairing interactions. Breaking nucleon pairs to form \\(T = 1\\) states demands substantial energy.\n   - \\(^{14}_{7}\\text{N}\\) is odd-odd, with weaker pairing effects, reducing the energy barrier for excitations.\n\n3. **Isospin Symmetry and Coulomb Effects**:\n   - \\(T = 1\\) states form isobaric triplets (e.g., \\(^{14}\\text{C}\\), \\(^{14}\\text{N}\\), \\(^{14}\\text{O}\\) for \\(^{14}_{7}\\text{N}\\)). The energy difference between these states is influenced by Coulomb repulsion. However, the lower excitation energy in \\(^{14}_{7}\\text{N}\\) reflects its less symmetric structure compared to \\(^{12}_{6}\\text{C}\\), where the doubly magic configuration amplifies the energy required to overcome symmetry energy penalties.\n\n**Basis for Assigning \\(T\\) Values**:\nIsospin \\(T\\) is ascribed based on the symmetry of nuclear forces. States with the same \\(T\\) form multiplets (e.g., triplets for \\(T = 1\\)) across isobars. Systematic energy differences between these states, primarily due to Coulomb interactions, allow identification of \\(T\\) values. For example, the \\(T = 1\\) triplet members (\\(^{14}\\text{C}\\), \\(^{14}\\text{N}\\), \\(^{14}\\text{O}\\)) share similar nuclear structure but differ in proton-neutron composition, with energy shifts governed by Coulomb effects.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Doubly magic }^{12}\\text{C} \\text{ requires more energy to disrupt its rigid structure compared to non-magic }^{14}\\text{N}.}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Doubly magic }^{12}\\text{C} \\text{ requires more energy to disrupt its rigid structure compared to non-magic }^{14}\\text{N}."], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Doubly magic }^{12}\\text{C} \\text{ requires more energy to disrupt its rigid structure compared to non-magic }^{14}\\text{N}.", "expr2": "2.3 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Doubly magic }^{12}\\text{C} \\text{ requires more energy to disrupt its rigid structure compared to non-magic }^{14}\\text{N}.", "expr2": "15.0 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
