Let the incident ray be parallel to the x-axis and strike the sphere at a height $h$ above the x-axis. The angle of incidence $\\theta_1$ at the first interface is given by $\\sin \\theta_1 = h/R$. By Snell's law, the angle of refraction $\\theta_2$ is given by $\\sin \\theta_2 = \\sin \\theta_1 / n = h/(nR)$.\n\nThe refracted ray travels to the back surface and is internally reflected. For total internal reflection to occur, the angle of incidence at the back surface must be greater than the critical angle $\\theta_c$, which is given by $\\sin \\theta_c = 1/n$. The angle of incidence at the back surface is equal to $\\theta_2$. Therefore, we require $\\theta_2 > \\theta_c$, or $\\sin \\theta_2 > 1/n$. This gives $h/(nR) > 1/n$, or $h > R$. This condition cannot be satisfied since $h \\le R$.\n\nHowever, if the sphere is coated with a reflective material on its back surface, then the ray will be reflected back along the same path. The ray will then be refracted at the front surface, and the angle of refraction will be equal to $\\theta_1$. The exiting ray will be parallel to the incident ray if the angle of incidence at the back surface is such that the reflected ray passes through the center of the sphere. This occurs when the refracted ray intersects the back surface at a point where the normal to the surface passes through the center of the sphere. In this case, the angle of incidence at the back surface is $\\theta_2$, and the angle of reflection is also $\\theta_2$. The ray will then be refracted at the front surface at an angle $\\theta_1$, and the exiting ray will be parallel to the incident ray.\n\nFor this to occur, we require $h = R/n$.\n\n**(b)** Scotchlite consists of small glass spheres embedded in a reflective material. The spheres are typically a few tens of micrometers in diameter. When light strikes a sphere, it is refracted at the first interface, internally reflected at the back surface, and refracted again at the front surface. The exiting ray is parallel to the incident ray, so the light is reflected back in the direction from which it came.\n\nThe reflective efficiency of Scotchlite depends on several factors, including the size and refractive index of the spheres, the reflectivity of the backing material, and the packing density of the spheres. The efficiency is highest when the spheres are closely packed and the backing material is highly reflective.\n\nFinal Answer: The required refractive index is $n = R/h$.

{"id": "optics/2-32", "solution": "Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n**1. Understanding the concept**\n\nThis problem deals with Fresnel diffraction from a circular aperture.  When a plane wave passes through a small circular opening, it doesn't simply create a sharp circular spot of light on a distant screen. Instead, due to diffraction, the light spreads out, creating a pattern of bright and dark rings. The central bright spot is known as the Airy disk.  We are looking for the distance at which this central bright spot is most clearly focused (largest distance).\n\n**2. Finding the Fresnel number**\n\nThe Fresnel number ($F$) is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the diffraction regime. It's defined as:\n\n$F = \\frac{a^2}{L \\lambda}$\n\nwhere:\n* $a$ is the radius of the aperture\n* $L$ is the distance from the aperture to the screen\n* $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light\n\nFor a reasonably well-defined bright spot, we want the Fresnel number to be close to 1.  We are looking for the *maximum* distance $L$, which corresponds to the *smallest* Fresnel number that still gives a reasonable focus.  We'll take $F=1$ as our criterion.\n\n**3. Calculating the maximum distance (L)**\n\nSetting $F=1$, we can solve for $L$:\n\n$L = \\frac{a^2}{\\lambda}$\n\nGiven $a = 0.5 \\, mm = 5 \\times 10^{-4} \\, m$ and $\\lambda = 5000 \\, \\overset{\\circ}{A} = 5 \\times 10^{-7} \\, m$, we have:\n\n$L = \\frac{(5 \\times 10^{-4} \\, m)^2}{5 \\times 10^{-7} \\, m} = \\frac{25 \\times 10^{-8}}{5 \\times 10^{-7}} \\, m = 0.5 \\, m$\n\n**4. Calculating the relative intensity**\n\nThe intensity of the central bright spot in the diffraction pattern is *not* simply the intensity of the incident light passing through the aperture.  The opaque sheet blocks a significant portion of the incident light.  The relative intensity of the central spot compared to the unobstructed intensity is simply the ratio of the aperture area to the total area (assuming uniform incident intensity).  However, since we are considering the *peak* intensity of the Airy disk, which is higher than the average intensity across the aperture, the relative intensity will be close to 1 when the Fresnel number is close to 1.  As the distance increases (Fresnel number decreases), the central spot becomes dimmer.\n\nSince we've chosen the distance corresponding to $F=1$, the relative intensity will be close to 1, but slightly less.  A more precise calculation would involve integrating the diffraction pattern, but for this approximation, we'll estimate it as close to 1.\n\nFinal Answer: The maximum distance is 0.5 m.

{"id": "optics/2-34", "solution": "Here's how to solve this Fresnel zone plate problem:\n\n**(a) Finding $r_1$**\n\n* **Concept:** The path difference between waves arriving at the focal point from the edges of consecutive zones is designed to be half a wavelength ($\\lambda/2$).

Since alternate zones are blocked, the contributions from the transparent zones add up.  Let's assume each transparent zone contributes an amplitude $A_0$.  Since we have two transparent zones, the total amplitude is approximately $2A_0$.\n* **Intensity Calculation:** Intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude. If the incident wave has intensity $I_0$, and a single open zone plate produces an intensity $I_1 = k A_0^2$, then the intensity with two open zones is $I = k(2A_0)^2 = 4I_1$.  If the entire plate were transparent, the intensity would be close to $I_1$.  Therefore, blocking alternate zones increases the intensity at the focal point by a factor of approximately 4 compared to a completely transparent plate.  Since the problem asks for the intensity in terms of the incident wave, and the intensity of the incident wave is $I_0$, the intensity at the focal point is $4I_1$.  We are given that the zones are in the ratio $1:\\sqrt{2}:\\sqrt{3}:\\sqrt{4}$, which means that the areas are in the ratio $1:1:1:1$.  Therefore, the amplitude from each zone is approximately the same.  If all zones were transparent, the amplitude would be small.  With alternating zones blocked, the amplitude is approximately $2A_0$, and the intensity is $4I_1$.  The intensity at the focal point is approximately $4I_1$.  Since $I_1$ is related to $I_0$, we can say that the intensity at the focal point is approximately $4I_1$.  The exact relationship between $I_1$ and $I_0$ is complex and depends on the details of the diffraction, but it is reasonable to assume that $I_1$ is a fraction of $I_0$.  Therefore, the intensity at the focal point is approximately $4I_1$.\n\n**(c) Other maxima**\n\n* **Concept:**  Constructive interference also occurs at points where the path difference is an odd multiple of $\\lambda/2$.\n* **Equation:**  $\\frac{r_1^2}{2z} = \\frac{(2n+1)\\lambda}{2}$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n* **Locations:** $z = \\frac{r_1^2}{(2n+1)\\lambda} = \\frac{f}{2n+1}$.

Coherent means the light waves are in phase with each other, and monochromatic means the light is of a single wavelength (or a very narrow range of wavelengths).\n\n(c) In a free-electron laser (FEL), the output is produced by **accelerated electrons passing through a periodic magnetic field called an undulator or wiggler**.  Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Energy Input:**  A beam of electrons is accelerated to relativistic speeds (near the speed of light) using a particle accelerator, such as a linear accelerator (linac). This high-energy electron beam is the energy source for the FEL.\n\n2. **Undulator/Wiggler Interaction:** The electron beam is then directed through the undulator, which has alternating magnetic poles. This causes the electrons to oscillate transversely to their direction of motion.  These oscillations cause the electrons to emit synchrotron radiation.\n\n3. **Stimulated Emission and Amplification:** The emitted radiation interacts with the oscillating electrons, stimulating them to emit further radiation that is in phase with the initial radiation. This process amplifies the radiation, creating a coherent beam.  The wavelength of the emitted radiation depends on the electron energy, the magnetic field strength of the undulator, and the undulator period.\n\n4. **Output:** The amplified, coherent radiation is then extracted as the laser output.\n\n(d) A key advantage of the FEL over previous types of lasers is its **tunability**.  The wavelength of the FEL output can be continuously tuned over a wide range by changing the energy of the electron beam or the parameters of the undulator magnetic field.

{"id": "optics/3-19", "solution": "**(a) The Blue Sky**\n\n* **Rayleigh Scattering:** The primary reason for the blue sky is Rayleigh scattering.  Sunlight is composed of a spectrum of colors. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with air molecules (primarily nitrogen and oxygen). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light. Rayleigh scattering is the elastic scattering of electromagnetic radiation by particles much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation.\n* **Wavelength Dependence:** The intensity of Rayleigh scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. This means shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered much more strongly than longer wavelengths (red and orange).\n* **Why not violet?:** Although violet light is scattered even more than blue, our eyes are less sensitive to violet, and the solar spectrum has less violet than blue.  The combination of these factors results in our perception of a blue sky.\n\n**(b) The Red Sun at Sunset**\n\n* **Longer Path Length:** At sunset and sunrise, the sunlight travels through a much longer path in the atmosphere to reach our eyes than it does during the day.\n* **Increased Scattering of Shorter Wavelengths:**  Because of this longer path, the shorter wavelengths (blue and green) are scattered away almost completely, leaving the longer wavelengths (red and orange) to dominate the light that reaches our eyes. This is why the sun appears reddish at these times.\n\n**(c) The Rainbow**\n\n* **Refraction, Reflection, and Dispersion:** Rainbows are formed by a combination of refraction, reflection, and dispersion of sunlight within water droplets.\n* **Refraction:** Sunlight enters a water droplet and is refracted (bent) due to the change in the medium. Different wavelengths of light are refracted by slightly different amounts (dispersion).\n* **Reflection:** The light then reflects off the back inner surface of the droplet.\n* **Refraction (again):** As the light exits the droplet, it is refracted again.\n* **Separation of Colors:** The different wavelengths of light emerge from the droplet at slightly different angles, creating a spectrum of colors.  The observer sees a rainbow when they are positioned with the sun behind them and the water droplets in front.\n\n**(e) The Twinkling of Stars**\n\n* **Atmospheric Refraction:**  Stars twinkle due to the turbulent nature of the Earth's atmosphere. As starlight passes through the atmosphere, it encounters pockets of air with varying temperatures and densities. These variations cause the light to be refracted (bent) in slightly different directions as it travels to our eyes.\n* **Apparent Position Shift:**  These continuous changes in refraction cause the apparent position and brightness of the star to fluctuate rapidly, giving the impression of twinkling.  This effect is more pronounced for stars lower on the horizon because their light passes through a greater amount of atmosphere.  Planets generally don't twinkle as much because they appear as tiny disks rather than point sources, and the variations in refraction average out across the disk.\n\n\nFinal Answer: The phenomena are explained by: (a) Rayleigh scattering, (b) increased scattering of shorter wavelengths due to a longer path length through the atmosphere, (c) refraction, reflection, and dispersion of sunlight within water droplets, and (e) atmospheric refraction causing fluctuations in the apparent position and brightness of stars.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Rayleigh scattering, atmospheric path length, refraction/reflection/dispersion, atmospheric refraction}} \\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Rayleigh scattering, atmospheric path length, refraction/reflection/dispersion, atmospheric refraction}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Rayleigh scattering, atmospheric path length, refraction/reflection/dispersion, atmospheric refraction}", "expr2": "\\text{The sky appears blue due to Rayleigh scattering, where shorter wavelengths (blue) are scattered more strongly.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Rayleigh scattering, atmospheric path length, refraction/reflection/dispersion, atmospheric refraction}", "expr2": "\\text{During sunset, sunlight passes through more atmosphere, scattering blue light out and leaving a red appearance.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "optics/3-10", "solution": "A photomultiplier tube (PMT) works by converting a photon into an amplified electrical signal.  Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Photocathode:** The incident photon strikes a photocathode, a material with a low work function. This interaction causes the photoelectric effect, ejecting an electron from the photocathode.\n\n2. **Dynodes:** The ejected electron is accelerated towards the first dynode by an electric field.  Dynodes are electrodes held at progressively higher potentials.\n\n3. **Secondary Emission:** When the accelerated electron strikes the first dynode, it causes the emission of multiple secondary electrons.\n\n4. **Multiplication Cascade:** These secondary electrons are then accelerated towards the next dynode, where each causes the emission of further secondary electrons. This process repeats across a series of dynodes, creating a cascade effect and significantly amplifying the initial signal.\n\n5. **Anode:** Finally, the large number of electrons produced in the cascade reach the anode, generating a measurable current pulse.  This current pulse is proportional to the intensity of the initial light (number of photons).\n\nNow, can a PMT distinguish between two photons whose energies differ by 50%?\n\nThe energy of a photon is directly related to its frequency (E = hf, where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency).  The number of electrons initially emitted from the photocathode depends on the number of incident photons, not their individual energies.  While the energy of the initial photoelectron *does* depend on the photon energy (via the photoelectric effect equation: KE = hf - W, where W is the work function), the subsequent multiplication process in the dynodes is largely independent of this initial energy.  The gain of the PMT (the number of electrons produced per initial photoelectron) is primarily determined by the dynode voltages.\n\nTherefore, while the initial photoelectron will have a different kinetic energy, the amplification process will be similar for both photons.  The resulting output pulse height will be primarily determined by the number of incident photons, not their individual energies.  So, a standard PMT cannot directly distinguish between two photons that differ in energy by 50%.  However, the initial kinetic energy difference *could* be detected if the PMT is coupled with an energy discriminator at the very first stage, before the multiplication cascade.

{"id": "optics/3-16", "solution": "The sky appears blue on a clear day due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering.  Rayleigh scattering is the scattering of electromagnetic radiation (including visible light) by particles of a much smaller wavelength. In the case of the Earth's atmosphere, the oxygen and nitrogen molecules are smaller than the wavelengths of visible light.\n\nWhen sunlight enters the atmosphere, shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) are scattered more effectively by these molecules than longer wavelengths (red and yellow). This is because the scattering intensity is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength.  This means blue light is scattered about 10 times more than red light.\n\nWhile violet light is scattered even more than blue light, our eyes are less sensitive to violet, and the sun emits slightly less violet light than blue.  The combination of these factors results in the sky appearing blue.\n\n(a) Reflection from the sea can contribute to the color we see, especially near the horizon, but it's not the primary reason for the blue sky.  If this were the primary reason, the sky would appear more blue over the ocean than over land, which is not generally the case.\n\n(b) Density fluctuations in the atmosphere do cause some scattering, but the dominant effect is Rayleigh scattering by individual air molecules.\n\n(c) Cobalt vapors are not present in the atmosphere in significant quantities and do not contribute to the sky's blue color.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{b}$", "final_answers": ["b"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "b", "expr2": "b"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "b", "expr2": "b"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "optics/3-29", "solution": "**(a) Searchlight Design**\n\n* **Physical Principle:** The goal is to collimate the light from the spherical source, meaning to make the rays parallel. This maximizes the intensity in the forward direction. We achieve this using a parabolic reflector.  A spherical source placed at the focal point of a parabolic mirror will have its light reflected into a parallel beam.\n\n* **Intensity Calculation:**  The initial luminous flux (total light emitted) is given by the candlepower multiplied by the solid angle it emits into (4π steradians).  The final luminous flux is the same (neglecting absorption), but concentrated into a smaller solid angle.  The beam candlepower is the luminous flux divided by the solid angle of the beam.\n\n* **Solid Angle of the Source:** The source emits light in all directions (4π steradians).\n\n* **Solid Angle of the Beam:** The solid angle of the beam (Ω) is given by the area of the reflector divided by the square of the focal length (f).  Assuming a circular reflector with diameter D = 10 cm = 0.1 m, the area is A = π(D/2)² = π(0.05 m)² .  We need to find f such that the beam candlepower is 10⁶ cd.\n\n* **Equation:** Initial candlepower * 4π = Final candlepower * Ω\n1000 cd * 4π = 10⁶ cd * (π(0.05 m)² / f²)\n\n* **Solving for f:**\nf² = (10⁶ * π * (0.05)² ) / (1000 * 4π)\nf ≈ 0.25 m\n\n* **Design:** A parabolic mirror with a diameter of 10 cm and a focal length of approximately 25 cm will collimate the light into a beam of approximately 10⁶ candlepower.\n\n**(b) Circular Polarization Instrument**\n\n* **Physical Principle:** Circularly polarized light is created by combining two linearly polarized waves of equal amplitude, perpendicular to each other, and with a phase difference of π/2.  A quarter-wave plate introduces this phase shift.\n\n* **Components:**\n    1. **Linear Polarizer:** Creates linearly polarized light from unpolarized light.\n    2. **Quarter-Wave Plate:**  Oriented at 45° to the polarization direction of the linearly polarized light. This converts linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light.\n    3. **Analyzing Quarter-Wave Plate:**  Another quarter-wave plate, also oriented at 45° but rotatable.\n    4. **Second Linear Polarizer (Analyzer):**  Used to analyze the light.\n\n* **Operation:**  Light passes through the linear polarizer and then the first quarter-wave plate, becoming circularly polarized.  The second quarter-wave plate converts the circularly polarized light back to linear polarization. The final polarizer analyzes the resulting linearly polarized light. By rotating the analyzing quarter-wave plate and the analyzer, one can determine the handedness (left or right) and intensity of the circularly polarized components.\n\n**(c) Stellar Size Estimation**\n\n* **Physical Principle:**  The apparent angular size of a star can be estimated using interferometry.  This technique relies on the wave nature of light and the interference pattern created by combining light from two separated telescopes.\n\n* **System (Michelson Stellar Interferometer):** Two mirrors, separated by a variable distance (d), reflect starlight towards two more mirrors that direct the light to a central beam combiner and detector.\n\n* **Interference:** The interference pattern at the detector varies as the mirror separation (d) is changed. The first minimum in the interference pattern occurs when d is related to the angular size (θ) of the star and the wavelength (λ) of the light:  d ≈ λ/θ\n\n* **Size Estimation:** By measuring the baseline d at which the first minimum occurs, and knowing the wavelength λ, the angular size θ can be calculated.  If the distance to the star is known, the physical size can be estimated using the small angle approximation:  Physical Size ≈ Distance × θ\n\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\[ \\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&(a) \\text{ Parabolic mirror with diameter 10 cm and focal length } \\approx 25 \\text{ cm} \\\\\n&(b) \\text{ Linear Polarizer + Quarter-Wave Plate + Rotating Quarter-Wave Plate + Analyzer} \\\\\n&(c) \\text{ Michelson Stellar Interferometer}\n\\end{aligned}\n} \\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&(a) \\text{ Parabolic mirror with diameter 10 cm and focal length } \\approx 25 \\text{ cm} \\\\\n&(b) \\text{ Linear Polarizer + Quarter-Wave Plate + Rotating Quarter-Wave Plate + Analyzer} \\\\\n&(c) \\text{ Michelson Stellar Interferometer}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&(a) \\text{ Parabolic mirror with diameter 10 cm and focal length } \\approx 25 \\text{ cm} \\\\\n&(b) \\text{ Linear Polarizer + Quarter-Wave Plate + Rotating Quarter-Wave Plate + Analyzer} \\\\\n&(c) \\text{ Michelson Stellar Interferometer}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{\\theta_0}{\\theta'} = 31.6"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&(a) \\text{ Parabolic mirror with diameter 10 cm and focal length } \\approx 25 \\text{ cm} \\\\\n&(b) \\text{ Linear Polarizer + Quarter-Wave Plate + Rotating Quarter-Wave Plate + Analyzer} \\\\\n&(c) \\text{ Michelson Stellar Interferometer}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "h = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{\\alpha}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "optics/3-11", "solution": "**(a) (i) Doppler Line Width:**\n\nThe Doppler line width refers to the broadening of spectral lines due to the Doppler effect.  Atoms or molecules in a gas are in constant thermal motion.  When an atom emitting light moves towards an observer, the observed frequency is slightly higher (blueshifted). Conversely, when the atom moves away, the frequency is lower (redshifted).  Since the atoms in a gas have a distribution of velocities (typically Maxwellian), this leads to a spread of observed frequencies around the central emission frequency, broadening the spectral line. The amount of broadening is proportional to the temperature and inversely proportional to the square root of the atomic mass.\n\n**(a) (ii) Natural Line Width:**\n\nThe natural line width is a consequence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle applied to energy and time.  An excited atomic state has a finite lifetime, Δt, before it decays to a lower energy state by emitting a photon.  This finite lifetime leads to an uncertainty in the energy of the excited state, ΔE, given by ΔEΔt ~ ħ.  Since the energy of the emitted photon is related to its frequency (E = hf), the uncertainty in energy translates to an uncertainty in the frequency, and thus a broadening of the spectral line. This broadening is independent of temperature or any external factors and is an inherent property of the transition itself.\n\n**(b) Doppler-Free Spectroscopy (Saturation Absorption Spectroscopy):**\n\nOne common technique for Doppler-free spectroscopy is saturation absorption spectroscopy.  Here's a simplified description:\n\n1. **Two counter-propagating beams:** A laser beam is split into two beams of equal intensity. These two beams are sent through the sample gas in opposite directions.\n\n2. **Hole burning:** When the laser frequency is slightly detuned from the atomic resonance, only atoms with a specific velocity component along the beam direction will absorb photons from one of the beams due to the Doppler effect. This creates a \"hole\" in the velocity distribution of the ground state atoms.  Simultaneously, atoms with the opposite velocity component will absorb photons from the counter-propagating beam, creating a separate hole.\n\n3. **Saturation:**  When the laser frequency is exactly at resonance, both beams interact with the same group of atoms (those with zero velocity component along the beam direction).  The strong laser field saturates the transition, meaning that a significant fraction of the atoms are in the excited state. This reduces the absorption of both beams.\n\n4. **Detection:** The intensity of the transmitted beams is monitored.  When the laser frequency sweeps through the resonance, a sharp dip in absorption is observed, corresponding to the interaction with the zero-velocity atoms. This dip is much narrower than the Doppler-broadened line because it is only affected by the natural linewidth.\n\nIn essence, the two counter-propagating beams select out the atoms with zero velocity component along the beam direction, effectively eliminating Doppler broadening for these atoms and allowing measurement of the natural linewidth.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is not a numerical value.

{"id": "optics/2-18", "solution": "Here's how the colored rings are formed and why they appear bright:\n\n**1. Unfolding the Optics:**\n\nThe mirror creates a virtual image of the light source (lamp) behind it. We can \"unfold\" the problem by imagining the mirror isn't there and the light source is located behind the mirror's plane at a distance equal to the actual distance between the lamp and the mirror.  The chalk dust particles are scattering light from both the real lamp and its virtual image.\n\n**2. Interference:**\n\nLight from the real source and the virtual source travels different distances to reach each chalk particle.  This path difference leads to interference.  Constructive interference (where the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength) creates bright regions, while destructive interference (where the path difference is an odd multiple of half the wavelength) creates dark regions.\n\n**3. Ring Formation:**\n\nThe locus of points with a constant path difference forms a hyperboloid.  Since we are observing these hyperboloids nearly edge-on, they appear as rings.  Different wavelengths (colors) of light have different wavelengths, so the condition for constructive interference is met at slightly different locations for each color, creating colored rings.\n\n**4. Brightness:**\n\nThe rings are bright due to the coherent scattering of light by the chalk dust particles.  The constructive interference amplifies the scattered light, making the rings much brighter than the general background scattering.  The chalk dust acts like a screen revealing the interference pattern.\n\n**5. Size Estimation:**\n\nLet 'd' be the distance between the lamp and the mirror, and 'r' be the radius of a ring.  The path difference between light from the real and virtual sources is approximately 2dr/L, where L is the distance from the mirror to the observer.  For constructive interference, this path difference must be an integer multiple of the wavelength (mλ).  So, 2dr/L = mλ.  Therefore, r = mλL/2d.

The diameter of the Airy disk (the central bright spot of the diffraction pattern) determines the resolution.  The angular radius of the Airy disk is given by:\n\n   θ = 1.22 λ/D\n\n   where λ is the wavelength of light and D is the diameter of the mirror.\n\n* **Atmospheric Seeing (for Earth-based telescopes):**  Turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere causes variations in the refractive index of the air, leading to blurring of the image. This effect typically limits the resolution to about 1 arcsecond, even for large telescopes.  This is more significant than diffraction for smaller telescopes.\n\n* **Mirror Imperfections:**  Deviations from a perfect parabolic shape in the mirror surface can also degrade the image.  This is less of a concern for high-quality astronomical mirrors.\n\n**Off-Axis Limitations:**\n\n* **Coma:**  Off-axis light rays are not focused to the same point as on-axis rays, leading to a comet-like or teardrop-shaped image.  This aberration becomes more pronounced further from the optical axis.\n\n* **Astigmatism:**  Another off-axis aberration that causes the image to appear elongated in one direction.\n\n* **Field Curvature:** The focal plane is not flat, but curved. This means that stars at different distances from the optical axis will not be in focus simultaneously.\n\n* **Distortion:** The magnification of the image changes with distance from the optical axis, leading to a distorted image.\n\n**Image Blob Size for On-Axis Star (Visible Light):**\n\nLet's calculate the size of the Airy disk for a star on-axis, assuming a wavelength of 550 nm (green light, roughly in the middle of the visible spectrum):\n\n1. **Angular Radius:**\n   θ = 1.22 * (550 x 10⁻⁹ m) / (0.1 m) \n   θ ≈ 6.71 x 10⁻⁶ radians\n\n2. **Linear Size:**\n   The linear size (diameter) of the Airy disk at the focal plane is given by:\n\n   s = f * 2θ\n\n   where f is the focal length.\n\n   s = 5 m * 2 * 6.71 x 10⁻⁶ radians\n   s ≈ 6.71 x 10⁻⁵ m = 67.1 μm\n\nTherefore, the diameter of the image blob (Airy disk) for an on-axis star is approximately 67.1 μm.

The two sources S and S' are coherent because S' is derived from S.\n\nHere's a diagram of the equivalent system:\n\n```\n      S' (virtual image)\n       •\n       |\n       | d\n-------|-------  Glass Plate\n       |\n       •\n      S (real source)\n\n       Screen\n```\n\n**2.

When light reflects from a medium with a higher refractive index (like glass) than the incident medium (like air), it undergoes a phase shift of π.\n\n**4.

This is achieved experimentally by placing the source and observation screen at a very large distance from the diffracting aperture/obstacle.  Alternatively, we can use lenses to render the wavefronts parallel.\n\n* **Fresnel Diffraction:** The curvature of the wavefronts is significant. This occurs when the source, the aperture, or the screen are close to each other.  No lenses are used.\n\n**(b) Experimental Arrangement for Fraunhofer Diffraction**\n\nA simple arrangement for observing Fraunhofer diffraction involves a point source (e.g., a laser), a collimating lens to create a parallel beam of light, the diffracting aperture, and a focusing lens to bring the diffracted rays to a sharp focus on a screen.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5cm);\ndraw((0,0)--(2,0)); // Source\ndraw((2,0)--(4,0));\nfilldraw(circle((2,0),0.2),black); // Point source\ndraw((4,-1)--(4,1)); // Collimating lens\ndraw((4,0)--(8,0));\ndraw((8,-0.5)--(8,0.5)); // Aperture\ndraw((8,0)--(12,0));\ndraw((12,-1)--(12,1)); // Focusing lens\ndraw((12,0)--(16,0));\ndraw((16,-2)--(16,2)); // Screen\nlabel(\"Source\",(2,-0.5),S);\nlabel(\"Collimating Lens\",(4,-1.5),S);\nlabel(\"Aperture\",(8,-0.5),S);\nlabel(\"Focusing Lens\",(12,-1.5),S);\nlabel(\"Screen\",(16,-2.5),S);\n[/asy]\n\n**(c) Diffraction Patterns**\n\n* **Single Slit:** The pattern consists of a central bright fringe (maximum) much wider and more intense than the secondary maxima. The secondary maxima are separated by dark minima.

Parallelism of the surfaces:**\n\n* **Method:** Use an interferometer, specifically a Fizeau interferometer.\n* **Procedure:** Place the glass window in the interferometer. The interferometer splits a beam of mercury green light, reflects one part off the front surface of the window and the other off the back surface. The two reflected beams are then recombined, creating interference fringes.\n* **Interpretation:** With perfectly parallel surfaces, the fringes would be straight and equally spaced (or absent if the thickness is a multiple of $\\lambda/2n$).

Constructive interference leads to bright maxima, and destructive interference leads to dark minima.\n\n**2. Phase Shift Due to Reflection**\n\nA crucial point is the phase shift that occurs upon reflection.  When light reflects from a medium with a higher refractive index than the incident medium (air to soap film in this case), there's a 180-degree phase shift (equivalent to adding an extra path length of λ/2).

The change in angular momentum is $2\\hbar$. Therefore, the torque is twice the value in part (a), i.e., $2\\tau_0$.\n\n**(c)**\n\nA half-wave plate flips the handedness of circularly polarized light. Thus, the light emerges as left-handed circularly polarized light. The angular momentum of the transmitted light is $-\\hbar$. The change in angular momentum is $2\\hbar$. Therefore, the torque is $2\\tau_0$.\n\n**(d)**\n\nThe light passes through the half-wave plate, gets reflected by the silvered surface, and passes through the half-wave plate again. The first pass through the half-wave plate changes the light to left-handed circularly polarized. The reflection changes the direction of propagation, but the light remains left-handed. The second pass through the half-wave plate changes the light back to right-handed circularly polarized. The final light is right-handed circularly polarized in the opposite direction. The change in angular momentum is $2\\hbar$.

{"id": "optics/1-29", "solution": "Here's how to find the location and size of the final image:\n\n**1. Image formation by the prism:**\n\n* The object is 6 cm from the first surface of the prism. Since the prism is a 45-45-90 triangle, the object is effectively 6 cm from the hypotenuse.\n* The prism shifts the apparent position of the object.  The shift can be calculated using Snell's law and geometry. However, since the prism is a 45-45-90 triangle and the object is placed symmetrically, the ray emerges parallel to the incident ray. The apparent position of the object is shifted by $d = t(1 - 1/n)$, where $t$ is the thickness of the prism at the position of the object and $n$ is the refractive index. In this case, $t = 6$ cm and $n = 1.5$, so $d = 6(1 - 1/1.5) = 2$ cm.\n* The object appears to be $6 + 10 + 2 = 18$ cm from the first lens.\n\n**2. Image formation by the first lens:**\n\n* The object distance for the first lens is $u_1 = 18$ cm. The focal length is $f_1 = 20$ cm.\n* Using the lens formula: $1/v_1 - 1/u_1 = 1/f_1$, we get $1/v_1 = 1/20 + 1/18 = (18 + 20)/(20 \\times 18) = 38/360$.\n* So, $v_1 = 360/38 \\approx 9.47$ cm. The image formed by the first lens is real and located 9.47 cm to the right of the first lens.\n\n**3. Image formation by the second lens:**\n\n* The image formed by the first lens acts as the object for the second lens. The distance between the lenses is 5 cm.\n* The object distance for the second lens is $u_2 = 5 - 9.47 = -4.47$ cm (negative since it's to the left of the lens). The focal length is $f_2 = -10$ cm.\n* Using the lens formula: $1/v_2 - 1/u_2 = 1/f_2$, we get $1/v_2 = -1/10 - 1/4.47 = (-4.47 - 10)/(10 \\times 4.47) = -14.47/44.7$.\n* So, $v_2 = -44.7/14.47 \\approx -3.09$ cm.

{"id": "optics/1-16", "solution": "Here's how to determine the ideal refractive index of the beads:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe goal is for light rays entering the bead to be refracted and then reflected at the back surface so that they return along the same path. This requires the bead to act as a retroreflector.\n\n**2. Applying Snell's Law and the Law of Reflection**\n\n* **Snell's Law:**  n₁sinθ₁ = n₂sinθ₂ , where n₁ and n₂ are the refractive indices of the two media, and θ₁ and θ₂ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n* **Law of Reflection:** The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Situation**\n\nFor the light to return along the same path, the angle of incidence at the back surface of the bead must be 0°. This means the light ray must hit the back surface perpendicularly.  Therefore, inside the bead, the light ray must travel along a radius.\n\n**4. Setting up the Equations**\n\nLet:\n* n_w be the refractive index of water (4/3)\n* n_b be the refractive index of the bead material\n* θ be the angle of incidence in water\n\nSince the light ray travels along a radius inside the bead, the angle of refraction inside the bead is 90°.\n\nApplying Snell's Law at the water-bead interface:\n\nn_w * sinθ = n_b * sin(90°)\n\n**5. Solving for n_b**\n\nn_w * sinθ = n_b * 1\nn_b = n_w * sinθ\n\nSince the light ray travels along the radius, the angle of incidence θ is such that sinθ = 1 (for a sphere).  This is because the ray enters at the edge of the bead and travels along the diameter.\n\nTherefore:\n\nn_b = n_w\n\n**6.

Since neither of these is true, we must consider the fact that the path length can change by an integer multiple of the wavelength.  Let's assume the path length changes by one wavelength, λ.  Since we don't know λ, we can use the initial condition that L=20 cm for sharp focus with air.  This means the optical path length is 40 cm.\n\nWhen the space is filled with water, the optical path length is 2L'.  We can set this equal to the original optical path length:\n\n2L' = 2L\nL' = L\n\nHowever, the problem states that L changes when the water is added.  This means we must consider the change in optical path length due to the water.  The optical path length in the water is 2nd, and in air it is 2d.  The difference is 2d(n-1).  This difference must be equal to the change in the optical path length in air, which is 2(20 - L').\n\n2d(n-1) = 2(20 - L')\nd(n-1) = 20 - L'\n\nWe don't know d, so we can't solve for L' directly.  However, we can use the fact that the optical path length must be the same in both cases:\n\n2L = 2(L' - d) + 2nd\nL = L' - d + nd\nL = L' + (n-1)d\n\nSince L=20 cm and n=4/3, we have:\n\n20 = L' + (1/3)d\n\nWe still have two unknowns.  Let's reconsider the problem.  The light travels to the back surface and back.  The initial optical path is 2L = 40 cm.  When water is added, the optical path is 2(L' - d) + 2(4/3)d = 2L' - 2d + (8/3)d = 2L' + (2/3)d.  Setting this equal to 40 cm:\n\n2L' + (2/3)d = 40\nL' + (1/3)d = 20\n\nThis is the same equation we derived earlier.  We need more information to solve this problem.  If we assume d is small compared to L, then L' is approximately 20 cm.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20 \\, \\text{cm}} \\]", "final_answers": ["20 \\, \\text{cm}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "20 \\, \\text{cm}", "expr2": "L = 12 \\, \\text{cm}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "optics/2-70", "solution": "Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**(a) Single Antenna Pattern:**\n\nA parabolic antenna with diameter $D$ and wavelength $\\lambda \\ll D$ will produce a diffraction pattern similar to a circular aperture.  At large distances ($r \\gg D^2/\\lambda$, Fraunhofer diffraction), the intensity pattern is roughly a central Airy disk surrounded by fainter rings. The angular width of the central maximum is approximately $\\theta \\approx 1.22 \\lambda/D$.  The shape is conical, with the apex at the antenna.\n\n**(b) Two Antennae in Phase:**\n\nWhen two antennae are driven in phase, their radiation interferes.  At large distances, the resulting pattern is the product of the single antenna pattern (the Airy pattern) and an interference pattern.  Since the antennae are separated by $d$ and point upwards, the interference pattern will consist of nearly vertical fringes. The angular separation between adjacent maxima is given by $\\Delta \\theta \\approx \\lambda/d$.  The overall pattern will be a series of vertical stripes, modulated by the Airy pattern of a single antenna.\n\n**(c) Frequency Stability Requirement:**\n\nFor the pattern to remain stationary, the phase difference between the two antennae must remain constant.  Let the frequencies of the two transmitters be $f_1$ and $f_2$. The phase difference at a point in space is given by $\\phi = 2\\pi (r_1/\\lambda_1 - r_2/\\lambda_2)$, where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the distances from the antennae to the point.  For the pattern to be stationary, the change in phase with time must be small.\n\nLet $\\Delta f = f_1 - f_2$ be the frequency difference.  Then $\\Delta \\lambda = \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2 = c(1/f_1 - 1/f_2) \\approx -c \\Delta f / f^2$.  The change in phase over time $t$ is approximately $\\Delta \\phi \\approx 2\\pi d \\Delta \\lambda / \\lambda^2 \\approx -2\\pi d (c \\Delta f / f^2) / \\lambda^2 = -2\\pi (d/\\lambda) (\\Delta f/f)$.\n\nWe want this phase change to be small, say less than $\\pi/2$ for the pattern to remain essentially stationary.  Therefore, we require $|\\Delta \\phi| < \\pi/2$, which gives $|2\\pi (d/\\lambda) (\\Delta f/f)| < \\pi/2$.

After passing through the slits, they interfere, creating a pattern of bright and dark fringes on the focal plane of the lens.  The intensity distribution is described by:\n\nI(θ) = I₀ cos²(πd sinθ/λ)\n\nwhere:\n\n* I(θ) is the intensity at angle θ\n* I₀ is the maximum intensity\n* d is the slit separation\n* λ is the wavelength of light\n\nThe pattern consists of a central bright fringe (maximum intensity) with alternating dark and bright fringes on either side, decreasing in intensity as we move away from the center.\n\nSketch:  The x-axis represents the position on the screen (or angle θ), and the y-axis represents the intensity. The graph shows a central peak with regularly spaced smaller peaks decreasing in intensity.\n\n**(b) Increased Slit Separation**\n\nIncreasing the slit separation (d) affects the spacing of the fringes.  The argument of the cosine function (πd sinθ/λ) becomes larger for a given angle θ. This means the fringes become more closely spaced.  The overall intensity envelope remains the same.\n\nSketch: The graph is similar to (a), but the peaks are closer together.\n\nExplanation:  Since the angular separation between fringes is approximately proportional to λ/d, increasing d decreases the angular separation, making the fringes appear closer together in the focal plane.\n\n**(c) Extended Source**\n\nAn extended source can be thought of as a collection of many point sources. Each point source creates its own interference pattern.  If the source is large enough, these individual patterns overlap and blur the overall interference pattern. The fringes become less distinct, and the contrast between bright and dark regions decreases.  As the source size increases, the fringes eventually wash out completely.\n\nSketch: The graph shows broader, less defined peaks compared to (a). The intensity of the minima increases, reducing the contrast.\n\nExplanation:  Each point source on the extended source produces a slightly shifted interference pattern. The superposition of these shifted patterns leads to a blurring effect.  The larger the angular extent of the source, the greater the blurring and loss of fringe visibility.\n\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n(a) Graph of cos²(πd sinθ/λ) with regularly spaced peaks.\n(b) Graph similar to (a) but with peaks closer together.

Since $\\Delta \\gg \\lambda$, the interference pattern will wash out for higher orders, as the phase difference will vary significantly. For small angles, the pattern will still be visible, but the fringes will be broader.

Let $I_{pol}$ be the intensity of the polarized component and $I_{unpol}$ be the intensity of the unpolarized component.\n\n* **Intensity through the analyzer:** When the analyzer's transmission axis is along $x$, the transmitted intensity is $1.5I_0$.  When it's along $y$, the transmitted intensity is $I_0$.  This tells us about the polarized component. Let $E_x$ and $E_y$ be the components of the electric field along the $x$ and $y$ axes for the polarized part. Then $I_x = |E_x|^2 = 1.5I_0 - \\frac{1}{2}I_{unpol}$ and $I_y = |E_y|^2 = I_0 - \\frac{1}{2}I_{unpol}$. The unpolarized light contributes equally to both $I_x$ and $I_y$.\n\n* **Intensity at angle θ:** When the transmission axis is at an angle $\\theta$ with the $x$-axis, the transmitted intensity is given by Malus's law for the polarized component plus half the intensity of the unpolarized component: $I(\\theta) = (I_x \\cos^2\\theta + I_y \\sin^2\\theta) + \\frac{1}{2}I_{unpol} = (1.5I_0 - \\frac{1}{2}I_{unpol})\\cos^2\\theta + (I_0 - \\frac{1}{2}I_{unpol})\\sin^2\\theta + \\frac{1}{2}I_{unpol} = I_0 + 0.5I_0\\cos^2\\theta$.\n\n* **Dependence on unpolarized fraction:** The final expression for $I(\\theta)$ does not depend on $I_{unpol}$.\n\n**(b)**\n\n* **Effect of the quarter-wave plate:** The quarter-wave plate introduces a phase shift of $\\pi/2$ between the $x$ and $y$ components of the polarized light, transforming the elliptically polarized light into linearly polarized light.\n\n* **Maximum intensity at 30°:** The maximum intensity now occurs at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$. This means the linearly polarized light emerging from the quarter-wave plate is polarized at an angle of $30^\\circ$ to the $x$-axis.  Let the amplitude of this linearly polarized light be $E$. Then $E_x = E\\cos(30^\\circ)$ and $E_y = E\\sin(30^\\circ)$.  Since the quarter-wave plate doesn't change the intensity of the polarized part, we have $E^2 = I_x + I_y = 1.5I_0 - \\frac{1}{2}I_{unpol} + I_0 - \\frac{1}{2}I_{unpol} = 2.5I_0 - I_{unpol}$.\n\n* **Calculating maximum intensity:** The maximum transmitted intensity through the analyzer is now $E^2$ plus half the unpolarized intensity: $I_{max} = E^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I_{unpol} = 2.5I_0 - I_{unpol} + \\frac{1}{2}I_{unpol} = 2.5I_0 - \\frac{1}{2}I_{unpol}$.

Materials like glass are transparent and refract light predictably, allowing for the construction of lenses for focusing and image formation.\n\n* **100 Å (EUV):**  At EUV wavelengths, most materials are highly absorbing.  This makes traditional lenses impractical.  Even air absorbs significantly at these wavelengths.

However, grazing incidence mirrors (where the light hits the mirror at a very shallow angle) can achieve high reflectivity.

Since *d* is related to the wavelength *λ* by the grating equation (*d*(sin*α* + sin*β*) = *mλ*), for a fixed angle of incidence and diffraction, *N* is proportional to 1/ *λ*.\n\n* **Comparison:**  Therefore, the resolving power *R* is inversely proportional to the wavelength *λ*.  A grating of fixed width will have a much higher resolving power at 100 Å than at 5000 Å (50 times higher).\n\n**(d) Minimum Resolvable Angular Separation:**\n\nThe minimum resolvable angular separation *θ* of an image-forming system of fixed diameter *D* is given by the Rayleigh criterion: *θ* = 1.22 *λ* / *D*.\n\n* **Comparison:**  The minimum resolvable angle is directly proportional to the wavelength.

This means higher resolution is achievable at shorter wavelengths.\n\n\nFinal Answer: The final answers are summarized below:\n(a) Lenses are commonly used at 5000 Å but not at 100 Å due to absorption.\n(b) Mirrors are used at both wavelengths, but grazing incidence and multilayer coatings are essential at 100 Å.\n(c) Resolving power of a grating is 50 times higher at 100 Å than at 5000 Å.\n(d) Minimum resolvable angle is 50 times smaller at 100 Å than at 5000 Å.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&(a) \\text{ 5000 Å: Lenses effective; 100 Å: Lenses impractical.} \\\\\n&(b) \\text{ 5000 Å: Standard mirrors; 100 Å: Grazing incidence multilayer mirrors.} \\\\\n&(c) \\text{ } R_{100 Å} = 50 \\times R_{5000 Å} \\\\\n&(d) \\text{ } \\theta_{100 Å} = \\frac{1}{50} \\times \\theta_{5000 Å}\n\\end{aligned}\n} \\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&(a) \\text{ 5000 Å: Lenses effective; 100 Å: Lenses impractical.} \\\\\n&(b) \\text{ 5000 Å: Standard mirrors; 100 Å: Grazing incidence multilayer mirrors.} \\\\\n&(c) \\text{ } R_{100 Å} = 50 \\times R_{5000 Å} \\\\\n&(d) \\text{ } \\theta_{100 Å} = \\frac{1}{50} \\times \\theta_{5000 Å}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&(a) \\text{ 5000 Å: Lenses effective; 100 Å: Lenses impractical.} \\\\\n&(b) \\text{ 5000 Å: Standard mirrors; 100 Å: Grazing incidence multilayer mirrors.} \\\\\n&(c) \\text{ } R_{100 Å} = 50 \\times R_{5000 Å} \\\\\n&(d) \\text{ } \\theta_{100 Å} = \\frac{1}{50} \\times \\theta_{5000 Å}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{Visible light can be focused using glass lenses, whereas X-rays can only be refracted by crystals.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&(a) \\text{ 5000 Å: Lenses effective; 100 Å: Lenses impractical.} \\\\\n&(b) \\text{ 5000 Å: Standard mirrors; 100 Å: Grazing incidence multilayer mirrors.} \\\\\n&(c) \\text{ } R_{100 Å} = 50 \\times R_{5000 Å} \\\\\n&(d) \\text{ } \\theta_{100 Å} = \\frac{1}{50} \\times \\theta_{5000 Å}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{X-rays can only be reflected at critical angles, unlike visible light, which can be reflected by common mirrors.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&(a) \\text{ 5000 Å: Lenses effective; 100 Å: Lenses impractical.} \\\\\n&(b) \\text{ 5000 Å: Standard mirrors; 100 Å: Grazing incidence multilayer mirrors.} \\\\\n&(c) \\text{ } R_{100 Å} = 50 \\times R_{5000 Å} \\\\\n&(d) \\text{ } \\theta_{100 Å} = \\frac{1}{50} \\times \\theta_{5000 Å}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\Delta\\lambda \\text{ is much narrower for X-rays due to smaller } \\lambda."}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&(a) \\text{ 5000 Å: Lenses effective; 100 Å: Lenses impractical.} \\\\\n&(b) \\text{ 5000 Å: Standard mirrors; 100 Å: Grazing incidence multilayer mirrors.} \\\\\n&(c) \\text{ } R_{100 Å} = 50 \\times R_{5000 Å} \\\\\n&(d) \\text{ } \\theta_{100 Å} = \\frac{1}{50} \\times \\theta_{5000 Å}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\Delta\\theta \\text{ is much smaller for X-rays than for visible light due to smaller } \\lambda."}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
