When the switch is closed at \\( t = 0 \\), the system starts charging the capacitor from zero voltage across it due to the presence of the battery.\n\nThe key components involved form an RC series combination:\n- Battery: Emf \\(\\varepsilon\\) and internal resistance \\( R_1 \\)\n- Resistor: Resistance \\( R_2 + R_3 \\) (since they are in parallel with each other and then in series with \\( R_2 \\))\n- Capacitor: Capacitance \\( C \\)\n\nFirst, calculate the equivalent resistance seen by the battery:\n\n\\[\nR_{eq} = R_1 + \\left( \\frac{R_2}{1+R_2/R_3} \\right) = R_1 + \\frac{R_2 R_3}{R_2 + R_3}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nR_{eq} = \\frac{(R_1)(R_2 + R_3) + R_2 R_3}{R_2 + R_3} = \\frac{R_1(R_2 + R_3) + R_2 R_3}{R_2 + R_3}\n\\]\n\nNow, using the standard formula for the charging equation of a capacitor in an RC circuit:\n\n\\[ \nV_C(t) = V_f - [V_f - V_i] e^{-t/RC}\n\\]\n\nWhere,\n\\( V_f = \\epsilon / (1 + R_1/(R_2 + R_3)) \\),\nand since there was no previous charge,\n\n\\[\nV_i = 0.\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nV_C(t) = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{1 + \\frac{R_1}{R_{eq}}} \\cdot \\left[ 1 - e^{-t/\\tau} \\right]\n\\]\n\nwhere \n\n\\[\n\\tau = R_{eq} C\n\\]\n\nSo, the charge \\( Q(t) \\) stored on the capacitor can be found via integration over its relationship with potential difference:\n\n\\[\nQ(t) = CV_C(t) = C \\cdot \\frac{\\varepsilon}{1 + \\frac{R_1}{R_{eq}}} \\left[ 1 - e^{-t/\\tau} \\right].\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the charge \\( q(t) \\) on the capacitor as a function of time \\( t \\):\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{q(t) = C \\cdot \\frac{\\varepsilon}{1 + \\frac{R_1}{R_{eq}}} \\left[ 1 - e^{-t/\\tau} \\right]}\n\\]\n\n#### Part (b): Initial Charge \\( Q_0 \\)\n\nIf the capacitor already has an initial charge \\( Q_0 \\) before switching occurs, the analysis changes slightly. Now, the capacitor begins discharging towards equilibrium while also being charged again once the switch opens.\n\nUsing similar steps as part (a), but now considering that the capacitor had some initial charge \\( Q_0 \\):\n\nInitial condition becomes non-zero; thus, the differential equation governing the discharge phase needs adjustment based upon superposition principle where one considers both charging and discharging phases separately.\n\nFor simplicity, let’s denote new parameters post-switch closure involving transient response including initial conditions:\n\nCharge dynamics would follow exponential decay plus steady state addition:\n\n\\[\nq(t) = Q_0 e^{-(t-t_0)/\\tau'} + C \\cdot \\frac{\\varepsilon}{1 + \\frac{R_1}{R_{eq}}}\\left[1-e^{{-(t-t_0)}/{\\tau'}}\\right],\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( \\tau' = R_{eq} C \\); however, exact expression depends more intricately on specific timing details around transition points which require detailed calculation beyond simple forms provided here directly.\n\nIn summary, accounting fully requires solving coupled ODEs reflecting full dynamic interaction between all elements during transitions.

This requires balancing the rate of change of phase front curvature induced by increased \\(n\\) versus standard diffraction loss:\n\nAssume steady-state condition; then, the critical criterion involves setting up equality between the \"effective\" focusing force provided by enhanced indices vs. defocusing effect of simple geometric optics.\n\nUsing Fermat’s principle adapted for slowly-varying envelopes,\n\n\\[\n\\Delta z / dz = d/dx [n(x)] |E|^2/(c/n).\n\\]\n\nSetting this equal to typical diffraction length scale yields:\n\\[\nd[n]/dx \\propto \\text{(diffraction length)}^{-1}.\n\\]\n\nSolving explicitly using above relations leads to finding specific values of \\(P_c\\). For detailed derivation, one needs to solve coupled differential equations considering full vector nature including polarization dependencies etc...\n\nHowever, simplified approach often used assumes quadratic dependence yielding:\n\n\\[\nP_c \\approx P_0 \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{n_2 |\\epsilon_0|^{1/2}}{1.22 \\pi c/\\lambda_0 } \\right]^2 .\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(P_0\\) represents some reference power level related fundamentally to physical constants involved.\n\nThus, the threshold power required for self-trapping becomes:\n\\[\n\\boxed{P_c = C \\left( \\frac{n_2 |\\epsilon_0|^{1/2}}{1.22 \\pi c /\\lambda_0 }\\right)^2 }\n\\]"}

This implies:\n\n- **Surface Normal Bound Current**: \n    - The surface normal bound current per unit length along the circumference is zero since the normal component of D vanishes.\n  \n- **Surface Tangential Bound Current**:\n    - There exists a surface current only if there is a discontinuity in B across the interface which doesn't exist here under steady conditions unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\nThus, typically, we don’t have significant surface currents contributing significantly except possibly near boundaries or interfaces.\n\n### Step 4: Volume Bound Current Due to Magnetization\n\nVolume bound current density \\(J_b^{vol}\\):\n\\[ J_b^{vol} = \\nabla \\times M = \\nabla \\times (\\chi_m H) \\]\n\nFor uniform distribution,\n\\[ J_b^{vol} = \\chi_m \\left[ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H}_f \\right] \\]\n\nWhere \\(\\mathbf{H}_f\\) is the auxiliary magnetic field produced solely by the free current \\(I\\).\n\nUsing Maxwell-Ampere equation considering volume bound currents:\n\\[ \\oint_{C} \\mathbf{B}_{total} d\\ell = \\mu_0 I_{free} + \\mu_0 \\int_V \\mathbf{J}_b^{vol} dV \\]\n\nSolving using symmetry arguments and applying Gauss’ Law for Magnetic Fields around a cylindrical Gaussian pillbox centered about the wire shows us how these contributions balance out.\n\n### Step 5: Net Bound Current Flowing Down the Wire\n\nConsidering the entire system including both free and bound currents, the net effect simplifies such that any additional bound current would cancel out effectively leaving just the original free current \\(I\\). Thus,\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Bound Current} = 0 \\]\n\nThis result comes from the fact that the magnetization current redistributes itself internally so as to maintain overall charge neutrality and continuity equations hold true throughout the medium.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe magnetic field at a distance \\(s > a\\) from the center of the wire remains unaffected by the presence of bound currents and follows the standard formula derived via Amperian loops enclosing the wire carrying current \\(I\\):\n\n\\[ B(s) = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2 \\pi s} \\]\n\nAnd the net bound current flowing down the wire is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]"}

Polarization Effects:\nFor electromagnetic waves normally incident or obliquely incident but still within the same medium, there's no change in phase velocity for linearly polarized light when considering only changes in material properties like permittivity. However, if the electric field components have different velocities depending on orientation, it can affect the effective refractive index which might be considered here as part of more complex scenarios not directly addressed without further assumptions about non-uniformity.\n\nGiven that our primary focus is on the motion-induced Doppler shifts rather than intrinsic birefringence issues related purely to polarization states under static conditions, we will proceed assuming standard wave behavior unless otherwise specified.\n\n#### 2. Motion Induced Doppler Shifts:\nWhen one medium moves towards/away from another, the observed frequency (and thus wavelength) changes according to the relativistic Doppler formulae.\n\\[ f' = f\\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}} \\]\nwhere \\(v\\) is the component of velocity along the line connecting the sources, i.e., perpendicular to the surface separating the materials (\\(\\pm c\\beta\\)).\n\nIn our case, since the interfaces move perpendicularly outwards into region 2,\nthe frequencies seen inside each medium would differ slightly based on whether they're approaching (+ve sign) or receding (-ve sign).\n\nHowever, these small differences do not significantly alter the basic Snell’s law relations used for determining refraction indices; instead, they modify how those indices appear dynamically over time.\n\n#### 3.

Angle Calculations Using Effective Indices:\nUsing Snell's Law: \n\\[ n_1 \\sin(\\theta_I')=n_2 \\sin(\\theta_T') \\]\nAnd similarly for reflected rays using Brewster's angle considerations modified accordingly.\n\nSince the exact transformation involves detailed trigonometric manipulations involving multiple reflections/transmissions across boundaries, let us simplify focusing just on first-order approximations around typical angles involved.\n\n#### Reflection & Transmission Angles:\nReflection follows similar principles:\n\\[ R = |\\cos(\\delta)|^2 \\]\nTransmission coefficient:\n\\[ T = |1-R|^2 \\]\n\nWhere \\(\\delta\\) accounts for path difference leading to constructive/destructive interference patterns influenced by the above adjustments.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter careful consideration including all relevant factors such as Doppler shifts affecting apparent speeds and hence refractive indices, the key result simplifies back largely to classical optics formulas given the relatively low beta values typically encountered experimentally compared to relativistic regimes.\n\nTherefore, reflecting the main points succinctly,\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n    \\begin{aligned}\n        \\theta_R &= \\theta_I \\\\\n        \\theta_T &= \\theta_I\\\\\n        \\end{aligned}}\n\\]\n\nThis assumes minimal impact beyond simple geometric transformations implied by slight modifications in perceived wavelengths/frequencies due to motion.
