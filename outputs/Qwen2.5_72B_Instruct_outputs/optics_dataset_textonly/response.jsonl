A key property of such a reflector is that it must redirect incoming light rays back along their original path.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Geometry of Reflection:**\n   - Consider a small section of the surface of the sphere where the incident ray strikes.\n   - For perfect retro-reflection, the reflected ray should be parallel to the incident ray but in the opposite direction.\n\n2. **Snell's Law:**\n   - When light enters the sphere from air, Snell's law applies:\n     \\[\n     n_1 \\sin(\\theta_i) = n_2 \\sin(\\theta_r)\n     \\]\n     where \\( n_1 \\) is the refractive index of air (\\( n_1 = 1 \\)), \\( n_2 \\) is the refractive index of the sphere material, \\( \\theta_i \\) is the angle of incidence, and \\( \\theta_r \\) is the angle of refraction inside the sphere.\n\n3. **Total Internal Reflection:**\n   - After entering the sphere, the light must undergo total internal reflection (TIR) at the inner surfaces before exiting back into the air.\n   - TIR occurs when the angle of incidence inside the sphere exceeds the critical angle \\( \\theta_c \\):\n     \\[\n     \\sin(\\theta_c) = \\frac{1}{n}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Retro-Reflection Condition:**\n   - For retro-reflection, the light must exit the sphere in the same direction as the incident ray after two reflections inside the sphere.\n   - This requires specific angles and symmetry conditions within the sphere.\n\n5. **Index of Refraction Calculation:**\n   - To achieve this, the refractive index \\( n \\) must be chosen such that the light can enter the sphere, undergo TIR twice, and then exit in the reverse direction.\n   - Typically, for efficient retro-reflection, the refractive index \\( n \\) should be around 1.9 or higher. This ensures that the critical angle is sufficiently low to allow multiple internal reflections without significant loss.\n\nThus, the required index of refraction \\( n \\) for effective retro-reflection in a spherical retro-reflector is approximately:\n\\[\n\\boxed{n \\approx 1.9}\n\\]\n\n### Part (b): Sketching and Discussing Scotchlite\n\n#### Sketch:\n```\n          /\\\n         /  \\\n        /    \\\n       /      \\\n      /________\\\n     |          |\n     |    O     |\n     |          |\n     \\__________/\n```\n\nIn this sketch:\n- The outer circle represents the glass microsphere.\n- The inner dot represents the metallic coating on the back side of the sphere.\n\n#### How Scotchlite Works:\n1. **Incident Light:**\n   - Light enters the front face of the microsphere.\n   \n2. **Refraction:**\n   - The light is refracted according to Snell's law upon entry.\n\n3. **Internal Reflections:**\n   - Inside the sphere, the light undergoes several internal reflections due to the high refractive index.\n\n4. **Metallic Coating:**\n   - On the backside of the sphere, there is a thin layer of metal (often aluminum), which acts as a mirror.\n   - This metallic coating causes the light to reflect back towards the entrance point.\n\n5. **Exit Path:**\n   - The light exits the sphere through the same point it entered, retracing its path.\n\n#### Factors Determining Reflective Efficiency:\n1. **Refractive Index:**\n   - Higher refractive indices enhance the ability to capture and internally reflect more light.\n\n2. **Surface Quality:**\n   - Smooth, defect-free surfaces minimize scattering losses.\n\n3. **Metallic Coating Thickness:**\n   - An optimal thickness of the metallic coating maximizes reflectivity while minimizing absorption.\n\n4. **Sphere Size:**\n   - Smaller spheres have better angular performance, allowing them to work over a wider range of incident angles.\n\n5. **Environmental Conditions:**\n   - Dust, moisture, and temperature variations can affect the performance of the retro-reflector.\n\nBy optimizing these factors, Scotchlite achieves highly efficient retro-reflection, making it useful in various applications such as road signs and safety gear. \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{n \\approx 1.9}\n\\]"}

By a sketch of image formation make it clear that your scheme will work.\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "To find a combination of two converging lenses that produce an inverted, virtual image at the position of the object and of the same size, we need to carefully analyze the properties of lens systems and their imaging characteristics.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding Converging Lenses:**\n   - A single converging lens can form real or virtual images depending on the object distance \\( d_o \\) relative to its focal length \\( f \\).\n   - For a real image (inverted), \\( d_o > f \\).\n   - For a virtual image (upright), \\( d_o < f \\).\n\n2. **Combining Two Converging Lenses:**\n   - We need to use two converging lenses such that the first lens forms an intermediate image, and this intermediate image serves as the object for the second lens.\n   - The overall system should result in an inverted, virtual image at the original object's location with the same magnification.\n\n3. **Lens Configuration:**\n   - Let the focal lengths of the two lenses be \\( f_1 \\) and \\( f_2 \\).\n   - Place the object at a distance \\( d_{o1} = 2f_1 \\) from the first lens.\n   - This configuration ensures that the first lens forms a real, inverted image at a distance \\( d_{i1} = 2f_1 \\) from itself (since \\( d_{o1} = 2f_1 \\)).\n\n4. **Positioning the Second Lens:**\n   - Place the second lens such that its front surface is at the position where the first lens forms the real image, i.e., at \\( d_{i1} = 2f_1 \\).\n   - Therefore, the distance between the two lenses is \\( D = 2f_1 + 2f_2 \\).\n\n5. **Image Formation by the Second Lens:**\n   - The intermediate image formed by the first lens acts as the object for the second lens.\n   - Since the intermediate image is at \\( d_{o2} = 2f_2 \\) from the second lens, the second lens will form a virtual, upright image at infinity if \\( d_{o2} = f_2 \\). However, since \\( d_{o2} = 2f_2 \\), the second lens will form a virtual, inverted image at the same distance \\( d_{i2} = 2f_2 \\) but on the opposite side of the second lens.\n\n6. **Final Image Position:**\n   - The virtual image formed by the second lens must coincide with the original object position.\n   - Given the distances involved, the total path length from the object through both lenses back to the object position is:\n     \\[\n     d_{\\text{total}} = d_{o1} + D - d_{i2}\n     \\]\n     Substituting the values:\n     \\[\n     d_{\\text{total}} = 2f_1 + (2f_1 + 2f_2) - 2f_2 = 4f_1\n     \\]\n\n7. **Magnification Consideration:**\n   - The magnification \\( M \\) of each lens is given by:\n     \\[\n     M_1 = -\\frac{d_{i1}}{d_{o1}} = -\\frac{2f_1}{2f_1} = -1\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     M_2 = -\\frac{d_{i2}}{d_{o2}} = -\\frac{2f_2}{2f_2} = -1\n     \\]\n   - The total magnification \\( M \\) of the system is:\n     \\[\n     M = M_1 \\times M_2 = (-1) \\times (-1) = 1\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the final image is inverted and has the same size as the object.\n\n### Sketch of Image Formation:\n\n```\nObject O -----> [Lens 1] ----> Intermediate Real Inverted Image I1 ----> [Lens 2] ----> Final Virtual Inverted Image F\n\nO ------------------(2f1)------------------> I1 -------------(D=2f1+2f2)--------------> F\n\nF coincides with O\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe required combination involves placing the object at \\( 2f_1 \\) from the first lens and positioning the second lens such that the distance between the two lenses is \\( 2f_1 + 2f_2 \\).

This results in a highly directional beam with minimal divergence. The coherence and monochromatic nature of the light make lasers useful in various applications such as precision cutting, medical treatments, optical communications, and scientific research.\n\n### Part (c): Production of Output in Free-Electron Lasers (FELs)\n\n#### Energy Input:\n- In a Free-Electron Laser (FEL), the initial energy input comes from accelerating electrons to very high speeds using linear accelerators (linacs). These electrons can be accelerated to relativistic velocities, meaning they travel close to the speed of light.\n\n#### Conversion Process:\n1. ** Electron Beam Generation:**\n   - Electrons are generated from a cathode and then accelerated through a series of stages until they reach the desired energy level.\n\n2. ** Interaction with Magnetic Field:**\n   - The high-energy electron beam passes through a periodic magnetic structure called an undulator or wiggler. As the electrons move through this field, they oscillate back and forth due to the alternating magnetic fields.\n\n3. ** Emission of Radiation:**\n   - The oscillating motion causes the electrons to emit synchrotron radiation. Initially, this radiation is spontaneous and has a broad spectrum.\n   \n4. ** Stimulated Emission:**\n   - As more electrons pass through the undulator, some of the spontaneously emitted photons interact with subsequent electrons, causing them to emit additional photons in phase with the original ones. This process amplifies the intensity of the light, leading to stimulated emission.\n\n5. ** Coherent Light Output:**\n   - The amplified, coherent light is extracted from the system and directed towards the intended application. The wavelength of the light can be tuned by adjusting the energy of the electrons or the period of the undulator.\n\n### Part (d): Advantage of FEL Over Previous Types of Lasers\n\nOne significant advantage of the Free-Electron Laser (FEL) over traditional solid-state, gas, or dye lasers is its tunability across a wide range of wavelengths. Traditional lasers operate within specific spectral ranges determined by the properties of their lasing medium (e.g., ruby crystals, helium-neon gases, or organic dyes).\n\nIn contrast, FELs can produce coherent light over a much broader spectrum, ranging from microwaves to X-rays. This tunability makes FELs extremely versatile for various applications, including materials science, biology, chemistry, and fundamental physics research. Additionally, FELs can achieve higher peak powers and shorter pulse durations compared to many other types of lasers, making them valuable tools for studying ultrafast processes and generating intense beams for industrial and medical uses.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Advantage: Tunable across a wide range of wavelengths}}\n\\]"}

Let's break down each phenomenon one by one, explaining the underlying physical principles.\n\n### (a) The Blue Sky\n\n**Principle Involved:** Rayleigh Scattering\n\n1. **Sunlight Composition**: Sunlight is composed of all colors of the visible spectrum, which combine to appear white.\n2. **Atmospheric Interaction**: As sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with gas molecules like nitrogen and oxygen.\n3. **Scattering Mechanism**: According to Rayleigh scattering, shorter wavelengths (blue light) scatter more than longer wavelengths (red light). This is because the intensity of scattered light is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength (\\(I \\propto \\frac{1}{\\lambda^4}\\)).\n4. **Resulting Color**: Since blue light scatters more, it spreads throughout the sky, making the sky appear blue during the day.\n\n\\[ \\text{Rayleigh Scattering Intensity} = I(\\theta) = I_0 \\left( \\frac{\\sin^2 2\\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta}{R^4} \\right) \\]\n\n### (b) The Red Sun at Sunset\n\n**Principle Involved:** Atmospheric Path Length and Scattering\n\n1. **Path Length Increase**: At sunrise or sunset, the sun is near the horizon, so its light travels through a much thicker layer of the atmosphere compared to when it is overhead.\n2. **Increased Scattering**: Due to the increased path length, most of the short-wavelength light (blue and green) gets scattered out of our line of sight.\n3. **Dominance of Long Wavelengths**: Only the long-wavelength light (red and orange) reaches us directly, giving the sun and the surrounding sky a reddish appearance.\n\n### (c) The Rainbow\n\n**Principle Involved:** Dispersion and Total Internal Reflection\n\n1. **Raindrops as Prisms**: Raindrops act like tiny prisms that refract, reflect, and disperse light.\n2. **Refraction**: When light enters a raindrop, it slows down and bends due to the change in medium from air to water.\n3. **Internal Reflection**: Inside the raindrop, some of the light reflects off the back surface of the drop.\n4. **Dispersion**: Upon exiting the raindrop, different wavelengths bend by slightly different amounts, separating into their constituent colors (violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red).\n5. **Observation Angle**: Each color emerges at a specific angle relative to the incoming light, creating a circular arc where these angles intersect the observer’s view.\n\n### (e) The Twinkling of Stars\n\n**Principle Involved:** Atmospheric Turbulence\n\n1. **Light Path Through Atmosphere**: Starlight must travel through Earth's turbulent atmosphere before reaching our eyes.\n2. **Turbulence Effects**: Air currents cause variations in temperature and density, leading to fluctuations in the index of refraction.\n3. **Light Refraction Variations**: These changes cause the starlight to be bent randomly, resulting in rapid shifts in brightness and position.\n4. **Apparent Flickering**: To observers on Earth, this results in the \"twinkling\" effect, known scientifically as stellar scintillation.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- **Blue Sky**: Caused by Rayleigh scattering, where blue light scatters more efficiently.\n- **Red Sun at Sunset**: Result of increased atmospheric path length causing preferential scattering of shorter wavelengths.\n- **Rainbow**: Formed by dispersion and total internal reflection within raindrops.\n- **Twinkling of Stars**: Caused by atmospheric turbulence affecting the path of starlight.\n\nFinal answers:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) Blue Sky: Rayleigh Scattering} \\\\\n\\text{(b) Red Sun at Sunset: Increased Path Length and Scattering} \\\\\n\\text{(c) Rainbow: Dispersion and Total Internal Reflection} \\\\\n\\text{(e) Twinkling of Stars: Atmospheric Turbulence}\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]"}

Can such a tube be used to distinguish between two photons whose energies differ by 50%?\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "### How a Photomultiplier Tube Works\n\nA **photomultiplier tube (PMT)** is a highly sensitive detector of light, capable of converting individual photons into measurable electrical signals. The basic operation involves several key components:\n\n1. **Photocathode**: When a photon strikes the photocathode, it can cause the emission of one or more electrons through the photoelectric effect. This process converts the energy of the incoming photon into kinetic energy of the emitted electron.\n\n2. **Dynodes**: The emitted electrons from the photocathode are accelerated towards a series of dynodes. Each dynode is held at a progressively higher positive potential relative to the previous one. As an electron hits a dynode, multiple secondary electrons are released due to the high electric field. This multiplication process continues as these secondary electrons strike subsequent dynodes, leading to an exponential increase in the number of electrons.\n\n3. **Anode**: Finally, the multiplied electrons reach the anode, which collects them and generates a current pulse that can be measured. The magnitude of this pulse is proportional to the initial number of photons detected.\n\n4. **Amplification**: The gain of a PMT can be very high, often on the order of \\(10^6\\) to \\(10^7\\), making it extremely sensitive even to single-photon events.\n\n### Distinguishing Between Two Photons with Different Energies\n\nTo determine whether a PMT can distinguish between two photons whose energies differ by 50%, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Energy Resolution**: The ability of a PMT to resolve different photon energies depends on its energy resolution, which is typically characterized by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the response function for a given wavelength. For many PMTs, the energy resolution is not particularly fine; they are generally better suited for detecting the presence of photons rather than their exact energies.\n\n2. **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: The SNR plays a crucial role in distinguishing between different photon energies. A higher SNR allows for better discrimination between closely spaced energy levels.\n\n3. **Spectral Response**: PMTs have a spectral response curve that varies with the wavelength of the incident light. If the wavelengths corresponding to the two photon energies fall within regions where the PMT's sensitivity changes significantly, it might help in distinguishing between them.\n\nGiven that the energy difference is 50%, let's analyze if this is sufficient for distinction:\n\n- **Photon Energy Relationship**: Let \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) be the energies of the two photons, with \\(E_2 = 1.5 E_1\\).\n- **Electron Kinetic Energy**: The kinetic energy of the electrons emitted from the photocathode will also differ proportionally.\n- **Multiplication Process**: While the multiplication process amplifies the signal, it does so uniformly regardless of the initial energy differences unless there are significant non-linearities in the dynode system.\n\nFor most standard PMTs:\n- The typical energy resolution is around 10-20%. \n- A 50% energy difference (\\(E_2 - E_1 = 0.5 E_1\\)) is quite substantial compared to the usual energy resolution limits.\n\nTherefore, under ideal conditions and assuming no significant noise or other interfering effects, a PMT should be able to distinguish between two photons whose energies differ by 50%.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe photomultiplier tube can indeed be used to distinguish between two photons whose energies differ by 50%, provided the energy resolution of the PMT is adequate and the signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently high.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Yes}}\n\\]"}

This results in a distribution of frequencies around the central frequency of the spectral line.\n\nMathematically, the Doppler line width (\\(\\Delta\\nu_D\\)) can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\Delta\\nu_D = \\frac{\\nu_0}{c} \\sqrt{\\frac{2k_B T}{m}} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\(\\nu_0\\) is the central frequency of the spectral line,\n- \\(c\\) is the speed of light,\n- \\(k_B\\) is the Boltzmann constant,\n- \\(T\\) is the temperature,\n- \\(m\\) is the mass of the atom or molecule.\n\nThis broadening increases with higher temperatures and lighter masses.\n\n#### (ii) The Natural Line Width\n\nThe **natural line width** is the intrinsic broadening of a spectral line caused by the finite lifetime of the excited state of the atom or molecule. According to quantum mechanics, the energy levels of atoms have a certain uncertainty related to their lifetimes. This leads to a spread in the energies of the transitions between these levels, which manifests as a broadened spectral line.\n\nThe natural line width (\\(\\Gamma\\)) is given by:\n\\[ \\Gamma = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\(\\hbar\\) is the reduced Planck's constant,\n- \\(\\tau\\) is the lifetime of the excited state.\n\nThis broadening is independent of external factors such as temperature and pressure and provides information about the decay processes of the atomic states.\n\n### Part (b)\n\nTo perform \"Doppler-free\" measurements of spectral lines, one common technique is the use of **saturated absorption spectroscopy**, particularly using a two-photon transition setup. Here’s how it works:\n\n1. **Two-Photon Transition**: In this method, two laser beams are used: one counter-propagating beam and another co-propagating beam. Both beams are tuned to half the energy difference required for the electronic transition of interest.\n   - The first photon excites the atom from the ground state to a virtual intermediate level.\n   - The second photon completes the transition to the excited state.\n\n2. **Counter-Propagating Beams**: By having one beam travel in the opposite direction to the other, any velocity component along the direction of propagation will cause equal and opposite Doppler shifts on each beam. Thus, only those atoms moving perpendicular to both beams experience no net Doppler shift, effectively eliminating the Doppler broadening.\n\n3. **Saturated Absorption**: Atoms that absorb photons from one beam become saturated and cannot absorb more until they de-excite. This creates a dark resonance where the probability of absorbing a photon from either beam is minimized. The resulting spectrum shows sharp features corresponding to the natural line width rather than being broadened by thermal motion.\n\n4. **Detection**: A detector measures the transmitted intensity through the sample. The presence of a dip in the transmission curve indicates the resonant condition, allowing precise measurement of the spectral line without Doppler broadening.\n\nBy carefully aligning the lasers and ensuring high stability, this technique allows for highly accurate determination of the natural line width and other fine details of the spectral line.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a)(i) The Doppler line width is the broadening of a spectral line due to the thermal motion of atoms.} \\\\\n\\text{(a)(ii) The natural line width is the intrinsic broadening due to the finite lifetime of the excited state.} \\\\\n\\text{(b) Saturated absorption spectroscopy using counter-propagating beams eliminates Doppler broadening,} \\\\\n\\text{allowing for precise measurement of the natural line width.}\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]"}

For a circular aperture with diameter \\( D \\), the angular resolution limit (Rayleigh criterion) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of light.\n- \\( D \\) is the diameter of the aperture.\n\nFor visible light, let's take \\( \\lambda \\approx 550 \\text{ nm} \\).\n\nGiven:\n- Diameter \\( D = 10 \\text{ cm} = 0.1 \\text{ m} \\)\n- Wavelength \\( \\lambda = 550 \\text{ nm} = 550 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m} \\)\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = 1.22 \\frac{550 \\times 10^{-9}}{0.1} = 6.71 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nNext, we convert this angular resolution to linear size using the focal length \\( f \\):\n\n\\[\nd = f \\cdot \\theta\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- Focal length \\( f = 500 \\text{ cm} = 5 \\text{ m} \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nd = 5 \\times 6.71 \\times 10^{-6} = 3.355 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ m} = 33.55 \\mu\\text{m}\n\\]\n\nThus, the size of the image \"blob\" for a star on-axis is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{33.55 \\mu\\text{m}}\n\\]\n\n### Off-Axis Resolution\n\nOff-axis performance can be affected by several factors including coma, astigmatism, and field curvature.\n\n#### Coma:\nComa causes asymmetric blurring that increases as you move away from the center of the field. The amount of coma depends on the third-order theory and can be significant for large fields or high numerical apertures. However, since the relative aperture (\\( f/D \\)) is relatively low (in this case, \\( f/50 \\)), the effect of coma will be minimal but not negligible.\n\n#### Astigmatism:\nAstigmatism occurs because rays passing through different parts of the lens focus at different points along two perpendicular planes. This results in elongated images rather than sharp points. Again, for a well-designed parabolic mirror with a small relative aperture, the impact of astigmatism should be manageable but present.\n\n#### Field Curvature:\nField curvature means that the best focus position changes across the field of view. This can cause some areas of the image to appear out-of-focus if the film plane is flat. Parabolic mirrors typically have a curved focal surface, which must be matched by the detector or corrected optically.\n\nIn summary, while the on-axis resolution is primarily limited by diffraction, off-axis resolution suffers additional degradation due to various aberrations like coma, astigmatism, and field curvature. These effects become more pronounced as you move further from the center of the field. \n\nHowever, for a small relative aperture and careful design, these off-axis effects can often be minimized to acceptable levels for many astronomical applications."}

This represents the main lobe of the single-slit diffraction pattern.\n\n2. **Interference Fringes:**\n   - Within the central maximum, draw several equally spaced bright and dark fringes. These represent the double-slit interference pattern.\n   - Since \\(d/a = 5\\), there will be multiple interference maxima within the central diffraction maximum.\n\n3. **Secondary Minima:**\n   - Beyond the central maximum, draw secondary minima and smaller side lobes as dictated by the single-slit diffraction pattern. These will have decreasing intensities as you move away from the center.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe interference pattern on the screen at the focal point of the converging lens will consist of a broad central maximum surrounded by narrower secondary maxima and minima, all modulated by the finer structure of the double-slit interference fringes. The number of visible interference fringes within the central diffraction maximum will depend on the specific values of \\(d\\), \\(a\\), and \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{A broad central maximum with multiple interference fringes inside it, followed by weaker secondary maxima and minima}}\n\\]"}

Set up the Twyman-Green interferometer with the glass window as the test object.\n2. Align the system so that both the reference and test paths are equal in length.\n3. Observe the interference fringes on a screen or camera.\n4.

If the object moves closer or farther away from this focus point, the image becomes blurred due to defocusing. The amount of defocus blur can be quantified using the concept of depth of field (DOF).\n\nFor a thin lens with focal length \\( f \\), if the lens is focused at a distance \\( d_f \\), the hyperfocal distance \\( H \\) is given by:\n\\[ H = \\frac{f^2}{N c} + f \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( N \\) is the f-number (aperture),\n- \\( c \\) is the circle of confusion diameter,\n- \\( f \\) is the focal length.\n\nThe near and far limits of acceptable focus when focusing at infinity (\\( d_f \\to \\infty \\)) are approximately:\n\\[ D_{\\text{near}} = \\frac{H}{2}, \\quad D_{\\text{far}} = \\infty \\]\n\nHowever, since the lens is already focused at 15 meters, we use the formula for the DOF directly:\n\\[ \\text{DOF} = \\frac{d_f^2 - f^2}{N c d_f} \\]\n\nGiven that the lens is focused at 15 meters (\\( d_f = 15 \\) m):\n\\[ \\text{DOF} = \\frac{(15)^2 - (0.06)^2}{N c \\cdot 15} \\approx \\frac{225 - 0.0036}{15 N c} \\approx \\frac{225}{15 N c} = \\frac{15}{N c} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Understanding Diffraction Blur\n\nDiffraction occurs because light waves spread out after passing through small apertures. The size of the Airy disk, which represents the central bright spot in the diffraction pattern, gives us a measure of the diffraction blur.

Let's break down the steps:\n\n### Part (a): Equation of the Reflection Surface\n\nWhen a flat disk of mercury is rotated with angular velocity \\(\\omega\\) about a vertical axis, the free surface of the mercury will take on a parabolic shape due to the balance between gravity and centrifugal forces.\n\nConsider a small element of mass \\(dm\\) located at radius \\(r\\) from the center of rotation. The forces acting on this element are:\n- Gravitational force: \\(dmg = dm g\\)\n- Centrifugal force: \\(dm r \\omega^2\\)\n\nThe equilibrium condition requires these two forces to balance each other along the normal direction to the surface. For a differential height change \\(dz\\) corresponding to a radial distance \\(dr\\), the slope of the surface can be described as:\n\\[ dz = -\\frac{F_{cent}}{F_g} dr = -\\frac{\\rho dV r \\omega^2}{\\rho dV g} dr = -\\frac{r \\omega^2}{g} dr \\]\n\nIntegrating both sides from \\(z = z_0\\) at \\(r = 0\\) to some general point \\(z(r)\\):\n\\[ z(r) = z_0 + \\int_0^r -\\frac{r' \\omega^2}{g} dr' \\]\n\\[ z(r) = z_0 - \\frac{\\omega^2}{2g} r^2 \\]\n\nSince \\(z(0) = 0\\), we have \\(z_0 = 0\\).

What would the characteristics of the telescope lens and short-focus lens have to be to get a beam of angular width $10^{-6}$ radian (first minimum on one side to first minimum on the other)? You may assume a rectangular aperture at the objective if you wish. \n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "To achieve a highly collimated laser beam for reflecting off the Moon, we need to carefully design the optical system using both a large-aperture telescope and a short-focus lens. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Beam Divergence\nThe angular width \\( \\theta \\) of the diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is given by:\n\\[ \\theta = \\frac{1.22 \\lambda}{D} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of the laser,\n- \\( D \\) is the diameter of the aperture.\n\nFor a rectangular aperture, the formula changes slightly, but for simplicity, we will use the above equation as it provides a good approximation.\n\n### Step 2: Desired Angular Width\nWe want the angular width \\( \\theta \\) to be \\( 10^{-6} \\) radians. Therefore:\n\\[ 10^{-6} = \\frac{1.22 \\lambda}{D} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Solving for Aperture Diameter \\( D \\)\nRearranging the equation to solve for \\( D \\):\n\\[ D = \\frac{1.22 \\lambda}{10^{-6}} \\]\n\nLet's assume the laser has a typical wavelength of \\( \\lambda = 532 \\text{ nm} \\) (green laser). Converting this to meters:\n\\[ \\lambda = 532 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m} \\]\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\\[ D = \\frac{1.22 \\times 532 \\times 10^{-9}}{10^{-6}} \\]\n\\[ D = \\frac{648.04 \\times 10^{-9}}{10^{-6}} \\]\n\\[ D = 0.64804 \\text{ m} \\]\n\\[ D \\approx 0.65 \\text{ m} \\]\n\nSo, the diameter of the aperture should be approximately 0.65 meters.\n\n### Step 4: Using a Large-Aperture Telescope Lens\nA large-aperture telescope can serve as the primary focusing element. The focal length \\( f_1 \\) of the telescope lens determines the initial convergence of the laser beam. For optimal performance, the focal length should be chosen such that the beam waist (the narrowest part of the Gaussian beam) coincides with the focus of the telescope.\n\n### Step 5: Adding a Short-Focus Lens\nAfter passing through the large-aperture telescope, the beam needs to be further collimated using a short-focus lens. This lens should be placed at the focal point of the telescope to ensure minimal divergence. Let’s denote the focal length of the short-focus lens as \\( f_2 \\).\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Focal Lengths\nTo minimize divergence, the distance between the two lenses should equal the sum of their focal lengths:\n\\[ d = f_1 + f_2 \\]\n\nGiven that the desired output beam should have a very small divergence angle, the ratio of the focal lengths \\( f_1 \\) and \\( f_2 \\) should be optimized. A common approach is to choose \\( f_1 \\) much larger than \\( f_2 \\) to reduce the overall divergence.\n\nAssuming \\( f_1 \\) is significantly larger than \\( f_2 \\), let’s consider practical values:\n- If \\( f_1 = 10 \\text{ m} \\),\n- Then \\( f_2 \\) should be much smaller, say \\( f_2 = 10 \\text{ cm} \\).\n\nThis configuration ensures that the beam is well-collimated after passing through the short-focus lens.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe required characteristics of the telescope lens and short-focus lens to achieve a beam of angular width \\( 10^{-6} \\) radians are:\n- **Telescope lens**: Diameter \\( D \\approx 0.65 \\text{ m} \\), focal length \\( f_1 \\approx 10 \\text{ m} \\).\n- **Short-focus lens**: Focal length \\( f_2 \\approx 10 \\text{ cm} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Telescope lens: } & D &= 0.65 \\text{ m}, & f_1 &= 10 \\text{ m} \\\\\n&\\text{Short-focus lens: } & f_2 &= 10 \\text{ cm}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]"}

This condition translates into:\n   \\[\n   k d = 2\\pi m / \\lambda_d = 2\\pi n,\n   \\]\n   where \\(k\\) is the wave number, \\(m\\) is the order of diffraction, and \\(\\lambda_d\\) is the wavelength corresponding to the grating period \\(d\\).\n\n3. **Wave Number Relationship:**\n   The wave number \\(k\\) is related to the frequency \\(\\omega\\) and the angle \\(\\theta\\) relative to the normal of the grating by:\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{\\omega}{c} \\cos \\theta.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combining Conditions:**\n   Substituting \\(k\\) into the phase matching condition gives:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\omega d}{c} \\cos \\theta = 2\\pi n.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solving for Frequency:**\n   Solving for \\(\\omega\\):\n   \\[\n   \\omega = \\frac{2\\pi c n}{d \\cos \\theta}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the frequency of the emitted radiation depends on the direction \\(\\theta\\) as follows:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi c n}{d \\cos \\theta}}.\n\\]\n\n### Part (b): Transmission Grating vs. Metallic Grating\n\nWhen the metallic grating is replaced by a transmission grating, several qualitative changes occur in the nature of the emitted radiation:\n\n1. **Material Properties:**\n   - A metallic grating reflects most incident waves, leading to strong reflection and refraction effects.\n   - A transmission grating allows more light to pass through, reducing these effects but introducing new ones such as diffraction patterns within the transmitted light.\n\n2. **Efficiency of Emission:**\n   - Metal surfaces have high reflectivity, which enhances the coupling efficiency between the charged particles and the radiated fields.\n   - Glass or other transparent materials may not couple as efficiently, potentially resulting in weaker emissions unless optimized for specific wavelengths.\n\n3. **Diffraction Patterns:**\n   - Both types of gratings produce diffracted beams, but the intensity distribution differs.\n   - A transmission grating typically produces multiple orders of diffraction symmetrically around the central maximum, while a reflective metal grating might show stronger peaks in certain directions due to enhanced reflections.\n\n4. **Directionality:**\n   - The directionality of the emitted radiation remains governed by the same phase-matching conditions derived above, but the overall pattern and intensities differ due to material properties.\n\nIn summary, replacing the metallic grating with a transmission grating primarily affects the efficiency and intensity distribution of the emitted radiation, rather than fundamentally changing the directional dependence of the frequencies involved. However, the detailed characteristics of the diffraction pattern and the strength of the emitted signals will vary significantly.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Replacing the metallic grating with a transmission grating changes the efficiency and intensity distribution of the emitted radiation, but the fundamental frequency-direction relationship remains the same.}}\n\\]"}

When considering high temperatures \\( T \\), densities \\( n \\), and strong magnetic fields \\( B \\), several broadening mechanisms come into play:\n\n1. **Thermal Doppler Broadening**:\n   - This mechanism arises from the random motion of atoms or ions due to their thermal energy. As the temperature increases, the velocity distribution of the particles becomes broader, leading to a wider range of frequencies being emitted as seen by an observer.\n\n2. **Collisional (Pressure) Broadening**:\n   - At higher densities, collisions between particles become more frequent. These collisions perturb the energy levels of the emitting species, causing shifts and broadenings in the spectral lines.\n\n3. **Magnetic Field Broadening (Zeeman Effect)**:\n   - In the presence of a magnetic field, the degeneracy of atomic energy levels is lifted, resulting in multiple closely spaced transitions.

Explain.\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "Let's address each part of the problem systematically:\n\n### Part (a)\n**Objective:** Show how a frequency-independent molecular electric polarizability leads to a wavelength-dependent scattering of sunlight similar to what is observed. Also, discuss the angular dependence of the scattering.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. **Molecular Polarizability:**\n   The electric dipole moment \\( p \\) induced in a molecule by an external electric field \\( E \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   p = \\alpha E\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\alpha \\) is the molecular polarizability. Given that \\( \\alpha \\) is frequency independent, we can write:\n   \\[\n   p(\\omega) = \\alpha E(\\omega)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Scattering Cross Section:**\n   For Rayleigh scattering, which occurs when particles much smaller than the wavelength of light scatter it, the differential cross section per unit solid angle \\( d\\sigma/d\\Omega \\) is proportional to the fourth power of the inverse wavelength:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\left(\\frac{\\sin^2 \\theta}{\\lambda^4}\\right)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\theta \\) is the scattering angle.\n\n3. **Wavelength Dependence:**\n   Since the polarizability \\( \\alpha \\) is constant, the main contribution to the wavelength dependence comes from the term \\( \\lambda^{-4} \\). Therefore, shorter wavelengths (blue light) are scattered more strongly than longer wavelengths (red light), leading to the deep blue color of the clear sky.\n\n4. **Angular Dependence:**\n   The angular distribution of the scattered light depends on the polarization state of the incident light. For unpolarized light, the total scattering intensity integrated over all angles still follows the \\( \\lambda^{-4} \\) law but shows variations depending on the observation direction. Specifically, forward and backward scattering directions have different intensities due to the cosine factor in the scattering amplitude.\n\nFinal Answer for Part (a):\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{(a)} \\quad I_{\\text{scattered}} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\lambda^4}}\n\\]\n\n### Part (b)\n**Objective:** Show that no net scattering results if the mean number of molecules \\( N_0 \\Delta V \\) in each air volume element is large and there is no fluctuation about this mean number.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. **Mean Number of Molecules:**\n   Let \\( N_0 \\) be the average number density of molecules, and consider a small volume element \\( \\Delta V \\). The mean number of molecules in this volume is:\n   \\[\n   N = N_0 \\Delta V\n   \\]\n\n2. **No Fluctuations:**\n   If there are no fluctuations around this mean value, then every volume element contains exactly \\( N \\) molecules.\n\n3. **Interference Effects:**\n   In such a case, the phase relationships among the scattered waves from different molecules within the same volume element will lead to constructive or destructive interference patterns. However, because the phases are uniformly distributed and there is no preferred orientation, these interferences cancel out on average.\n\n4. **Net Scattering Intensity:**\n   As a result, the coherent sum of the scattered fields from all molecules in the volume element averages to zero, meaning there is no net scattering.\n\nFinal Answer for Part (b):\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{(b)} \\quad \\text{No net scattering}}\n\\]\n\n### Part (c)\n**Objective:** Show that if the root-mean-square fluctuation of the number of molecules equals the square root of the mean number, the net scattering intensity is as if each molecule scatters independently with no interference between molecules.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. **Fluctuation in Number Density:**\n   The root-mean-square fluctuation in the number of molecules \\( \\delta N \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (\\delta N)^2 = \\langle N^2 \\rangle - \\langle N \\rangle^2\n   \\]\n   For Poisson statistics, the variance is equal to the mean:\n   \\[\n   \\langle N^2 \\rangle - \\langle N \\rangle^2 = \\langle N \\rangle\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   \\delta N = \\sqrt{\\langle N \\rangle}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Independent Scattering:**\n   When the number of molecules varies randomly according to a Poisson distribution, the phase differences between the scattered waves become random. Each molecule effectively acts as an independent source of scattering.\n\n3. **Intensity Calculation:**\n   The total scattered intensity is the sum of the individual intensities from each molecule, without any significant coherence effects. Mathematically, this means:\n   \\[\n   I_{\\text{total}} = N \\cdot I_{\\text{single}}\n   \\]\n   where \\( I_{\\text{single}} \\) is the intensity scattered by one molecule.\n\nFinal Answer for Part (c):\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{(c)} \\quad I_{\\text{total}} = N \\cdot I_{\\text{single}}}\n\\]\n\n### Part (d)\n**Objective:** Explain why there is enhanced scattering when the relative humidity is near 100%.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. **High Relative Humidity:**\n   At high relative humidity, particularly close to 100%, water vapor condenses into tiny droplets known as aerosols.\n\n2. **Aerosol Formation:**\n   These droplets act as additional scattering centers. Unlike single molecules, these droplets are larger and their size becomes comparable to the wavelength of visible light.\n\n3. **Enhanced Scattering Mechanism:**\n   Larger particles cause stronger scattering through mechanisms like Mie scattering, which does not follow the \\( \\lambda^{-4} \\) dependence typical of Rayleigh scattering. Instead, Mie scattering can enhance the overall scattering efficiency across a broader range of wavelengths.\n\n4. **Effect on Sky Color:**\n   The presence of these larger droplets increases the amount of light scattered back towards the observer, making the sky appear whiter or less blue compared to conditions with lower humidity.\n\nFinal Answer for Part (d):\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{(d)} \\quad \\text{Enhanced scattering due to formation of water droplets (aerosols) causing Mie scattering}}\n\\]"}

Explain your reasoning.\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "To determine whether the fish sees the light source as blue-shifted, red-shifted, or unchanged in frequency, we need to consider the principles of refraction and the Doppler effect.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding Refraction:**\n   - When light travels from one medium to another, its speed changes due to the different indices of refraction of the media.\n   - The index of refraction \\( n \\) for water is greater than that of air (\\( n_{\\text{water}} > n_{\\text{air}} = 1 \\)).\n   - As light enters the water from the air, it slows down and bends towards the normal according to Snell's law:\n     \\[\n     n_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2)\n     \\]\n     where \\( n_1 \\) and \\( n_2 \\) are the indices of refraction of the initial and final media, respectively, and \\( \\theta_1 \\) and \\( \\theta_2 \\) are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\n2. **Frequency Change Due to Medium Transition:**\n   - The frequency of light does not change when it transitions between media; only the wavelength and speed change.\n   - In air, the speed of light is \\( c \\).\n   - In water, the speed of light is reduced to \\( v = \\frac{c}{n} \\).\n\n3. **Doppler Effect Consideration:**\n   - The Doppler effect describes how the observed frequency of a wave changes if there is relative motion between the source and the observer.\n   - However, in this scenario, both the light source and the fish are stationary. There is no relative motion along the line of sight.\n\n4. **Vertical Observation:**\n   - Since the fish is looking directly upwards (vertically), the angle of incidence and refraction are such that the light path is perpendicular to the interface.\n   - For vertical observation, the angle of incidence \\( \\theta_1 \\) is 0 degrees, and thus the angle of refraction \\( \\theta_2 \\) is also 0 degrees.\n   - This means the light ray continues straight without bending upon entering the water.\n\n5. **Conclusion on Frequency Shift:**\n   - Given that the frequency of light remains constant during the transition between media and there is no relative motion between the source and the observer, the frequency of the light seen by the fish will be the same as the frequency emitted by the source.\n\nTherefore, the fish sees the light source with no frequency shift. The frequency change is identically zero.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{No frequency shift}}\n\\]"}

This matches the condition where the maximum intensity is transmitted through both devices when the analyser transmission axis makes an angle of \\( 30^\\circ \\) with the x-axis.\n\nHowever, since the intensity should match the sum of the contributions from the polarized and unpolarized parts, we already determined that the fraction of unpolarized light is \\( f = 0.6 \\).\n\n### Final Answers for Part (b):\n\nMaximum intensity:\n\\[ \\boxed{1.125 I_0} \\]\n\nFraction of unpolarized light:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.6} \\]"}

Specifically, contrast:\n\n(a) Use of lenses.  \n(b) Use of mirrors.  \n(c) Chromatic resolving power of gratings of fixed width.  \n(d) Minimum resolvable angular separation of an image-forming system of fixed diameter.\n\n\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "To discuss the differences between optical systems operating at different wavelength regimes (specifically around 100 Å and 5000 Å), we need to consider several key aspects: the use of lenses, mirrors, chromatic resolving power of gratings, and minimum resolvable angular separation.\n\n### (a) Use of Lenses\n\n**At 100 Å (X-ray regime):**\n- **Materials:** At these short wavelengths, most materials are highly absorptive or reflective rather than transparent. Therefore, traditional refractive lenses made from glass or other common materials cannot be used.\n- **Alternatives:** X-rays can be focused using specialized techniques such as grazing incidence reflection off smooth surfaces or multilayer coatings that create constructive interference for specific wavelengths. These methods do not rely on refraction but instead on diffraction and reflection principles.\n\n**At 5000 Å (Visible light regime):**\n- **Materials:** In this range, many materials like glass, quartz, and plastics are transparent and have well-characterized indices of refraction.\n- **Lenses:** Traditional refractive lenses can be effectively used to focus visible light. The design and fabrication of these lenses are well-established and widely utilized in various applications such as cameras, microscopes, and telescopes.\n\n### (b) Use of Mirrors\n\n**At 100 Å (X-ray regime):**\n- **Reflection Angle:** Due to high absorption, X-rays require very shallow angles of incidence (grazing incidence) to reflect efficiently. This limits the geometry and size of mirrors that can be used.\n- **Surface Quality:** Extremely smooth surfaces are required to minimize scattering losses. Multilayer coatings may also be applied to enhance reflectivity at specific wavelengths.\n\n**At 5000 Å (Visible light regime):**\n- **Reflection Angle:** Visible light can be reflected over a wide range of angles without significant loss. Conventional mirrors with metallic coatings (e.g., aluminum, silver) are effective.\n- **Surface Quality:** While surface quality is still important, it does not need to be as stringent as in the X-ray regime. Standard polishing and coating techniques suffice for most applications.\n\n### (c) Chromatic Resolving Power of Gratings of Fixed Width\n\nThe chromatic resolving power \\( R \\) of a grating is given by:\n\\[ R = mN \\]\nwhere \\( m \\) is the order of diffraction and \\( N \\) is the number of lines per unit length.\n\n**At 100 Å (X-ray regime):**\n- **Grating Design:** X-ray gratings often use holographic or ruled patterns etched into metal substrates. The line spacing must be much smaller due to the shorter wavelength.\n- **Resolving Power:** For a fixed physical width, the number of lines \\( N \\) will be higher compared to longer wavelengths, leading to potentially better resolving power if the same number of orders \\( m \\) can be achieved.\n\n**At 5000 Å (Visible light regime):**\n- **Grating Design:** Visible light gratings can be more easily fabricated with larger line spacings, allowing for simpler manufacturing processes.\n- **Resolving Power:** For a fixed physical width, fewer lines are needed, which might result in lower resolving power unless higher-order diffractions are utilized.\n\n### (d) Minimum Resolvable Angular Separation of an Image-Forming System of Fixed Diameter\n\nThe minimum resolvable angular separation \\( \\theta \\) is given by the Rayleigh criterion:\n\\[ \\theta = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D} \\]\nwhere \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength and \\( D \\) is the aperture diameter.\n\n**At 100 Å (X-ray regime):**\n- **Angular Resolution:** \n  \\[ \\theta_{\\text{X-ray}} = 1.22 \\frac{100 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{m}}{D} \\]\n\n**At 5000 Å (Visible light regime):**\n- **Angular Resolution:** \n  \\[ \\theta_{\\text{visible}} = 1.22 \\frac{5000 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{m}}{D} \\]\n\nComparing the two:\n\\[ \\frac{\\theta_{\\text{visible}}}{\\theta_{\\text{X-ray}}} = \\frac{5000 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{m}}{100 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{m}} = 50 \\]\n\nThus, the minimum resolvable angular separation for visible light is 50 times worse than for X-rays when the aperture diameter \\( D \\) is the same.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) At 100 Å, lenses are impractical; alternatives include grazing incidence reflection and multilayer coatings.} \\\\\n&\\text{   At 5000 Å, conventional refractive lenses are effective.} \\\\\n&\\text{(b) At 100 Å, mirrors require extremely smooth surfaces and small angles of incidence.} \\\\\n&\\text{   At 5000 Å, standard polished and coated mirrors work well.} \\\\\n&\\text{(c) At 100 Å, gratings have finer line spacing and potentially higher resolving power.} \\\\\n&\\text{   At 5000 Å, gratings have coarser line spacing and generally lower resolving power.} \\\\\n&\\text{(d) The minimum resolvable angular separation for visible light is 50 times worse than for X-rays.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]"}

Since \\( d_i \\) is positive and \\( d_o \\) is positive, but \\( f_d \\) is negative:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{d_i} + \\frac{1}{f_o} = \\frac{1}{-f_d} \\]\nSolving for \\( d_i \\):\n\\[ \\frac{1}{d_i} = \\frac{1}{-f_d} - \\frac{1}{f_o} = -\\frac{1}{f_d} - \\frac{1}{f_o} = -\\left(\\frac{1}{f_d} + \\frac{1}{f_o}\\right) \\]\nSince \\( f_d = \\frac{f_o}{M} \\):\n\\[ \\frac{1}{d_i} = -\\left(\\frac{M}{f_o} + \\frac{1}{f_o}\\right) = -\\frac{M+1}{f_o} \\]\nThus,\n\\[ d_i = -\\frac{f_o}{M+1} \\]\n\nThe total length \\( L_d \\) of the telescope with the diverging eyepiece is:\n\\[ L_d = f_o + |d_i| = f_o + \\frac{f_o}{M+1} = f_o \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{M+1}\\right) \\]\n\n### Step 3: Ratio of the Lengths\n\nWe need to find the ratio \\( \\frac{L_c}{L_d} \\):\n\\[ \\frac{L_c}{L_d} = \\frac{f_o \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{M}\\right)}{f_o \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{M+1}\\right)} = \\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{M}\\right)}{\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{M+1}\\right)} \\]\n\nSimplifying the expression inside the fraction:\n\\[ \\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{M}}{1 + \\frac{1}{M+1}} = \\frac{\\frac{M+1}{M}}{\\frac{(M+1)+1}{M+1}} = \\frac{\\frac{M+1}{M}}{\\frac{M+2}{M+1}} = \\frac{(M+1)^2}{M(M+2)} \\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the lengths is:\n\\[ \\frac{L_c}{L_d} = \\frac{(M+1)^2}{M(M+2)} \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe ratio of the lengths of the two telescopes is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{(M+1)^2}{M(M+2)}}\n\\]\n\n### Reason for Choosing the Longer Telescope:\n\nOne might choose to use the longer telescope (with the converging eyepiece) for a given magnification \\( M \\) because it provides more physical separation between the objective lens and the eyepiece. This can make the telescope easier to handle and align, especially if the observer needs to adjust their position or if there are mechanical constraints that require additional space. Additionally, a longer tube may reduce stray light and improve contrast, which can enhance the overall viewing experience."}
