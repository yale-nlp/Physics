This results in a highly directional beam of light with a narrow spectral bandwidth.\n\n### (c) How is the output produced in the Free-Electron Laser (FEL)?\n\nIn a Free-Electron Laser (FEL), the output is produced through the following steps:\n1. **Electron Beam Generation**: A high-energy electron beam is generated using an accelerator such as a linear accelerator or synchrotron.\n2. **Undulator Magnet Array**: The electron beam passes through a periodic magnetic field created by an undulator magnet array. As electrons pass through this alternating magnetic field they oscillate transversely due to Lorentz force.\n3. **Radiation Production**: These oscillations cause the emission of electromagnetic radiation via Bremsstrahlung process. Due to the periodicity of the undulator, these emissions interfere constructively leading to amplification of specific wavelengths.\n4. **Energy Conversion**: Energy from the kinetic motion of the electrons is transferred into photons of coherent light. The wavelength of the emitted light can be tuned by adjusting either the energy of the electron beam or the strength/period of the undulator magnets.\n5. **Optical Cavity** : In some configurations, mirrors reflect the emitted light back along the path of the electron beam enhancing further stimulated emission and thus amplifying the intensity of the resulting laser pulse.\n\n### (d) Identify a particular advantage of the FEL over previous types of lasers\n\nOne significant advantage of the Free Electron Lasers (FELs) compared to conventional lasers is their tunability across a wide range of frequencies.

Can such a tube be used to distinguish between two photons whose energies differ by 50%?\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "### How a Photomultiplier Tube Works\n\nA photomultiplier tube (PMT) is a highly sensitive detector of light in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared ranges. Here's a brief description of its operation:\n\n1. **Photocathode**: The process begins when a photon strikes the photocathode, which is typically made of materials with low work functions like cesium or potassium compounds.\n2. **Photoelectric Effect**: If the energy of the incident photon exceeds the material’s work function, it ejects an electron from the surface via the photoelectric effect.\n3. **Electron Multiplication**:\n   - These electrons are then accelerated towards a series of dynodes using high voltage applied across them.\n   - Each time these electrons strike a dynode they release multiple secondary electrons due to the impact ionization phenomenon.\n4. **Amplification Cascade**: This multiplication cascade continues through several stages of dynodes until there is a large number of electrons produced for each initial photoelectron.\n\nThe resulting current pulse can be measured as output signal proportional to the intensity of incoming radiation.\n\n### Distinguishing Between Two Photon Energies Differing By 50%\n\nTo determine if a PMT can distinguish between two photons differing in energy by 50%, we need to consider the following factors:\n- **Energy Resolution** : The ability of the device to differentiate between different levels of input signals.\n- **Noise Levels**: Internal noise within the system that could obscure small differences in detected signals.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Signal Generation**:\n\n    Let \\( E_1 \\) and \\( E_2 = 1.5E_1\\) represent the energies of the two photons where \\( E_2 > E_1\\).\n\n2. **Number of Photoelectrons Generated**:\n\n    Assuming perfect quantum efficiency,\n     \\[ N_{e} = kE \\]\n      Where \\(k\\) is some constant related to conversion factor from energy into number of emitted electrons.\n\n    For our case,\n\n    \\[N_e^1=kE_1\\]\n    \\[N_e^2=1.5kE_1\\]\n\n3. **Gain Factor**:\n\n    Gain (\\(G\\)) refers to amplification provided by successive dynodes. Typically this gain varies exponentially over many orders of magnitude depending on design parameters but let us assume uniform gain per stage.\n\n    Thus total charge collected after all stages will be approximately given by:\n    \\[Q_i=N_e^i*G \\]\n\n4. **Distinguishability Condition**:\n\n    To discern difference effectively, the ratio \\(\\frac{Q_2}{Q_1}\\) should exceed certain threshold determined by inherent noise characteristics of detection setup.\n\n    Given \\( Q_2/Q_1=\\frac{N_e^2 * G }{N_e^1 * G } =\\frac {1.5kE_1}{kE_1}=1.5\\)\n\n    Therefore, ideally, the signal-to-noise ratio must allow distinguishing between values separated by more than 50%.\n\nIn practice, however, real-world limitations include dark currents, thermal noise etc., making exact differentiation challenging without sophisticated calibration techniques.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile theoretically possible under ideal conditions, practical constraints often limit the resolution achievable solely relying upon standard PMT configurations alone; thus additional measures might necessitate enhancing sensitivity further beyond basic operational capabilities.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Possible Theoretically}}\\]"}

(You need not be quantitative, but your answer should make clear that you understand the basic physics involved.)\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "### Part (a)\n\n#### (i) The Doppler Line Width:\n\nThe **Doppler line width** refers to the broadening of a spectral line due to the Doppler effect caused by the thermal motion of atoms or molecules. In a gas or plasma, particles move randomly with velocities determined by their temperature. This random motion results in a distribution of frequencies observed from different directions.\n\nWhen light emitted by these moving particles reaches an observer, it can appear shifted towards higher or lower frequencies depending on whether the particle is moving away from or toward the observer respectively. This frequency shift leads to a spread in the observed wavelengths around the central wavelength corresponding to the transition energy between two atomic levels. Therefore, the resulting spectral line appears broader than if all emitters were stationary relative to each other.\n\nMathematically, this broadening can be described using the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution of the emitting particles:\n\\[ \\Delta f_D = \\frac{f_0}{c} v_{\\text{rms}} \\]\nwhere \\(f_0\\) is the center frequency of the spectral line,\n\\(v_{\\text{rms}}\\) is the root mean square speed of the particles given by \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T}{\\mu}}\\), where \\(k_B\\) is Boltzmann's constant, \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature, and \\(\\mu\\) is the reduced mass of the emitter.\nThis broadening mechanism is particularly important in high-temperature gases such as those found in stars or laboratory plasmas.\n\n#### (ii) Natural Line Width:\n\nThe **natural linewidth**, also known as Lorentzian broadening, arises from the finite lifetime (\\(\\tau\\)) of excited states within individual atoms or molecules before they decay back to ground state via spontaneous emission. According to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, there exists an inherent uncertainty in both time and energy associated with any quantum mechanical process: \\[ \\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\geq \\hbar/2 \\]\n\nFor an atom in an excited state with average lifetime \\(\\tau\\), the uncertainty in its energy level is approximately \\(\\Delta E\\). Consequently, when photons are emitted during transitions out of this excited state, their energies will vary slightly about some mean value leading to a range of possible frequencies centered around the nominal transition frequency (\\(f_0\\)). Thus, the natural linewidth (\\(\\Gamma\\)) is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the excited state:\n\\[\\Gamma = \\frac{h}{\\pi\\tau}\\]\n\nWhere \\(h\\) is Planck's constant. This type of broadening occurs even without external perturbations like collisions or electric fields; hence it represents intrinsic property of isolated systems governed solely by quantum mechanics principles.\n\n### Part (b):\n\nTo measure “Doppler-free” spectra, we must eliminate the effects of Doppler broadening while still observing the natural linewidths accurately. One effective method involves utilizing techniques based upon counter-propagating laser beams interacting with atoms/molecules inside a vapor cell or beam setup.\n\nA common experimental approach employs **Saturated Absorption Spectroscopy**:\n\n1. **Setup**: A collimated laser beam passes through a sample containing the absorbing species (e.g., sodium vapor). Simultaneously, another identical laser beam travels in exactly opposite direction after being reflected off mirrors placed outside the absorption medium.\n\n2. **Interaction**:\n   - When the first laser beam interacts with the atoms traveling along its path, it excites them into upper energy levels causing absorption dips at specific resonant frequencies.\n   - Atoms moving perpendicularly experience no net Doppler shifts since equal numbers travel towards and against either beam direction thus canceling out overall Doppler contributions.\n\n3. **Detection**:\n   - By monitoring transmitted intensity variations across narrow ranges near resonance peaks, one observes sharp features representing true natural widths unaffected by Doppler motions.\n   - These signals correspond directly to hyperfine structures or isotope shifts which would otherwise remain obscured under broadened profiles seen conventionally.\n\n4. **Result Interpretation**:\n   - The resultant spectrum shows much narrower resonances compared to standard absorption spectroscopy because only zero-velocity class contributes significantly here eliminating bulk thermal broadening influences entirely.\n\nIn summary, saturated absorption spectroscopy allows precise measurement of fundamental properties related purely to internal dynamics rather than macroscopic environmental factors thereby providing valuable insights into underlying physical processes governing interactions among elementary constituents comprising matter itself.\n\n\\(\\boxed{}"}

The angular resolution due to diffraction for a circular aperture is given by the Rayleigh criterion:\n\n\\[ \\theta = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\theta\\) is the angular resolution,\n- \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of light,\n- \\(D\\) is the diameter of the aperture.\n\nGiven:\n- Diameter \\( D = 10 \\, \\text{cm} = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} \\),\n- Focal length \\( f = 500 \\, \\text{cm} = 5 \\, \\text{m} \\).\n\nAssuming visible light with a central wavelength around \\(\\lambda = 550 \\, \\text{nm} = 550 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m}\\),\n\nThe angular resolution is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = 1.22 \\cdot \\frac{550 \\times 10^{-9}}{0.1}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this,\n\n\\[\n\\theta = 6.71 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{radians}.\n\\]\n\nNext, convert this angle into linear dimensions using the focal length:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Diameter of Airy disk} = \\theta \\cdot f.\n\\]\nSubstituting values gives us:\n\n\\[\nd_{\\text{Airy}} = 6.71 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 5 = 3.355 \\times 10^{-5}\\, \\text{m}= 33.55\\, \\mu m.\n\\]\n\nThus, the size of the image blob for a star on axis for visible light is approximately $34$ micrometers.\n\n### Off-Axis Resolution\n\nOff-axis, additional factors such as coma and astigmatism become significant. For a well-designed paraboloid mirror, these aberrations can be minimized but not entirely eliminated. Coma, which causes point sources away from the optical axis to appear as comets or streaks, becomes more pronounced further from the center.\n\nHowever, since the problem specifies a small relative aperture, spherical aberration will also play some role. Spherical aberration occurs when rays passing through different zones of the lens focus at slightly different points along the optic axis. This effect increases with distance from the optical axis.\n\nIn summary, while diffraction limits the resolution on-axis, off-axis performance is degraded primarily by coma and secondarily by other aberrations like astigmatism and field curvature.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe size of the image “blob” for a star on axis for visible light is roughly \\[ \\boxed{34\\,\\mu m}. \\]"}

If there's no temporal coherence between them then it will result in random fluctuations rather than clear-cut interference fringes.\n\nSecondly, the wavelengths involved play a significant role: shorter wavelength leads to more closely spaced interference maxima/minima making detection easier; longer ones spread out these points requiring higher precision from our sensing apparatus. Additionally, path differences matter too - when observing interference phenomena like Young’s double-slit experiment, equal distances traveled by interfering beams ensure maximum visibility of fringe contrast due to perfect overlap leading towards bright/dark bands formation respectively depending upon whether crest meets trough or vice versa during superposition process itself!\n\nLastly but importantly, sensitivity & resolution capabilities of detecting equipment come into picture here as well since human senses alone may fall short especially while dealing with high-frequency sounds/ultraviolet lights etc., necessitating usage of specialized tools such as microphones/spectrometers accordingly based on specific application scenario being considered herein contextually speaking!"}
