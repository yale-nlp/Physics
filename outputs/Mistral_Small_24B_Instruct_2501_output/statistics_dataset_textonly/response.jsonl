This leaves us with $(60-80x)$ cals remaining.\n\nNow if y grams of water evaporates then it uses up 596*y calories from what remains after melting i.e., $(60-80x)-596y$\n\nFinally z grams of ice sublimes consuming 676z calories from whatever was left over after both previous steps.\n\nSo we have two equations based on conservation laws:\n\\[ 80x + 596y+676z = 60 \\]\nand \\[ x+y+z = 1 \\]\n\nSolving these simultaneous linear equations gives us values of x,y,z respectively.\n\nHowever, given the constraint that the sum must not exceed 1gram and the fact that the latent heats required far exceeds the available 60calories, it becomes clear that none of them could undergo complete transformation.\n\nThus, the best approximation under such conditions is that almost nothing happens because the energy provided isn't enough to drive significant mass transfer between states.\n\nTherefore, the masses remain approximately unchanged:\n\n\\[\\boxed{m_{ice}=1\\,g,\\, m_{water}=1\\,g,\\, m_{vapour}=1\\,g}\\]"}

Since each nucleus has two possible states (\\(\\uparrow\\),\\(\\downarrow\\)), there are \\(2^N\\) microstates leading to maximum entropy:\n\\[\nS_{\\max }=\\ln\\left(\\frac{N!}{((N / 2)!)^2}\\right)\\approx N k \\ln 2.\n\\]\n\nSince the entropy of the solid remains nearly constant regardless of temperature changes within our range of interest,\n\n#### Phase Transition Behavior Under Pressure:\n\nWhen considering the Gibbs free energy difference between the liquid and solid phases under different pressures and temperatures, we use the relation:\n\\[\n\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S + PV.\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(H\\) (enthalpy) change during transition is small compared to other terms, we focus primarily on the entropy term \\(TS\\).\n\nFor equilibrium conditions where both phases coexist, the chemical potentials must equalize:\n\\[\n\\mu_{L}(p,T)=\\mu_{S}(p,T).\n\\]\n\nUsing the Clausius-Clapeyron equation which relates the slope of the coexistence curve to enthalpies and volumes:\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{dT}=-\\frac{\\Delta S}{\\Delta V},\n\\]\nwe substitute the known values:\n\\[\n\\Delta S = S_{L}-S_{S}, \\\\\n\\Delta V = V_{L}-V_{S}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation gives us:\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{dT}=- \\left(S_{L}-\\gamma R T\\right)/\\left(V_{L}-V_{S}\\right)\n\\]\n\nAs \\(T\\rightarrow0\\), since \\(S_{L}\\rightarrow\\gamma R T\\) becomes negligible relative to \\(S_{S}\\), thus:\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{dT}\\propto -\\frac{S_{S}}{V_{L}-V_{S}}<0.\n\\]\n\nThus, increasing pressure will lower the melting point further, allowing cooling through adiabatic compression processes.\n\n### Semi-Quantitative Graph Description:\n\nBased on the analysis, the qualitative shape of the \\(p\\)-\\(T\\) phase diagram would show:\n\n* A negative slope indicating that higher pressures favor the solid phase even at very low temperatures.\n* As pressure rises, the system transitions towards the solid phase, releasing heat and lowering its overall temperature.\n\nIn conclusion, applying high pressure to a liquid-solid mixture of Helium-3 at extremely low temperatures results in a shift toward the solid phase, thereby reducing the temperature effectively.\n\n\\[\\boxed{}"}

Therefore,\n\nIf no work is done on either part nor heat exchanged externally then:\n\n\\(\\Delta S_B > 0\\)\n\nand similarly\n\n\\(\\Delta S_C > 0\\).\n\nThus, if neither subsystem undergoes significant changes internally while maintaining overall isolation, the net effect would still result in:\n\n\\[\\Delta S_A = \\Delta S_B + \\Delta S_C\\]\n\nwhich implies:\n\n\\[\\Delta S_A \\geqslant 0,\\]\n\nindicating that the total entropy of the entire system cannot decrease; it stays constant or increases depending upon whether interactions lead to further equilibration processes.\n\nTherefore, the entropy of an isolated system \\(A\\) will generally tend to stay constant or increase based on the above arguments.\n\nConclusion:\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Entropy of an isolated system } A \\text{ will remain constant or increase}}.\\]"}

To derive it, consider the following steps:\n\nFirstly, express the natural log of \\( n! \\):\n\\[\n\\ln n!= \\sum_{j=1}^n \\ln j\n\\]\n\nNext approximate the discrete sum via integration:\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^n f(j) \\approx \\int_1^n f(x)\\,dx + C\n\\]\n\nApplying this approach yields:\n\\[\n\\ln n!\\approx\\int_1^{n} d x \\ln x+\\mathcal{O}(1)\n\\]\n\nEvaluating the integral:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int_1^ndx\\, \\ln x &= [x \\ln x]_1^n-\\int_1^n dx \\\\\n&= n \\ln n - n + 1\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, we obtain:\n\\[\n\\ln n! \\approx n \\ln n - n + O(1)\n\\]\n\nSince constants do not affect derivatives, they're often omitted during calculations focusing primarily upon asymptotic behavior.\n\n#### Part (d): Using Stirling's Approximation\n\nUsing Stirling's approximation derived above, rewrite the entropy expression obtained previously:\n\n\\[\nS(n) \\approx k \\left[ N \\ln N-(N-n) \\ln(N-n)-n \\ln n+n \\right]+C\n\\]\n\nSimplify further:\n\\[\nS(n) \\approx k[N \\ln N-N+(N-n) \\ln(N-n)+n \\ln n]-C\n\\]\n\nNow differentiate w.r.t \\( n \\), setting derivative equal zero to locate maxima/minima points:\n\\[\n\\frac{dS}{dn}=\\frac{k}{\\ln e}[ -\\ln(N-n)+\\ln n]=0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( n \\),\n\\[\n\\ln(N-n)-\\ln n=0 \\implies N-n=n \\implies n^* =\\frac{N}{2}\n\\]\n\nHence, the most probable configuration occurs precisely halfway between extremes.\n\n#### Part (e): Negative Temperature\n\nGiven the internal energy relation:\n\\[\nU=(N/2)n\\cdot 2\\mu B=kT^2\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial U}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( T \\rightarrow \\infty \\) implies infinite heat capacity, suggesting unbounded absorption without limit.

Explain", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "Let's address each part of the question step-by-step:\n\n### (a) What causes the temperature rise in the stratosphere?\n\nThe temperature rise in the stratosphere is primarily caused by the absorption of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun by ozone ($O_3$) molecules. Here’s how it works:\n1. **Ozone Formation**: Ozone is formed when oxygen molecules ($O_2$) are split into atomic oxygen ($O$) by UV radiation.\n   \\[\n   O_2 + h\\nu \\rightarrow 2O\n   \\]\n   where \\(h\\nu\\) represents a photon of UV light.\n\n2. **Ozone Absorption**: Atomic oxygen then combines with molecular oxygen to form ozone.\n   \\[\n   O + O_2 \\rightarrow O_3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Heating Mechanism**: When UV photons interact with ozone molecules they can break them apart again releasing energy that heats up the surrounding air.\n    - This process absorbs significant amounts of solar UV radiation, converting this radiant energy into thermal energy.\n4. **Temperature Increase**: As more UV radiation is absorbed by ozone, the temperature increases, leading to the observed temperature rise in the stratosphere.\n\nThus, the primary cause of the temperature increase in the stratosphere is the absorption of UV radiation by ozone.\n\n### (b) Why does the warm stratosphere surround Earth permanently?\n\nThe warm stratosphere maintains its position around the Earth due to several factors:\n1. **Stable Temperature Gradient**: The temperature gradient between the troposphere and the stratosphere creates a stable layer known as the tropopause. Above the tropopause, temperatures start increasing because of the presence of ozone.\n2. **Atmospheric Circulation**: Atmospheric circulation patterns help maintain this structure. In particular, the Brewer-Dobson circulation transports air masses vertically within the stratosphere but also horizontally towards the poles, maintaining the overall stability of the system.\n3. **Radiative Balance**: The balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared radiation helps sustain the temperature profile. The absorption of UV radiation by ozone ensures continuous heating in the stratosphere while the lower layers remain relatively cool.\n4. **Chemical Stability**: The chemical processes involving ozone formation and destruction create a self-regulating mechanism that keeps the concentration of ozone relatively constant over time, ensuring consistent heating.\n\nThese combined effects ensure that the stratosphere remains warmer than the underlying troposphere, creating a stable atmospheric layer.\n\n### (c) How do sound waves propagate in the tropopause region?\n\nSound waves propagating through the tropopause experience unique behavior due to the specific temperature gradients present there:\n1. **Refraction Effects**:\n   - At the tropopause boundary, the sharp change in temperature affects the speed of sound. Since the speed of sound depends on temperature (\\(v = \\sqrt{\\gamma RT}\\), where \\(\\gamma\\) is the adiabatic index, R is the gas constant for dry air, T is absolute temperature).\n   - Because the temperature changes rapidly across the tropopause, sound waves refract or bend away from regions of higher temperature toward colder areas below.\n2. **Wave Guiding Effect** :\n   - Due to refraction, sound waves tend to be guided along the tropopause rather than dispersing outward. This guiding effect allows sound waves to travel long distances without dissipating quickly.\n3. **Intensity Decrease**:\n   - Although some attenuation occurs due to spreading outwards, the dominant factor affecting wave propagation is the decrease in amplitude proportional to distance traveled. For spherical waves, the intensity typically falls off inversely with distance squared (\\(\\frac{I}{R^2}\\)). However, under certain conditions such as those found near the tropopause, the effective fall-off rate may approximate linearly (\\(\\frac{I}{R}\\)) if the wavefronts become elongated parallel to the tropopause surface.\n\nTherefore, sound waves emitted by aircraft flying close to the tropopause can indeed travel considerable distances before their intensities diminish significantly.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{}\n\\]"}

Due to the anisotropy of graphite’s structure, phonons behave differently along the basal plane compared to perpendicular directions.\n    - We have two types of phonons: acoustic modes and optical modes. Acoustic phonons involve collective motion of all atoms while optical phonons involve relative motions of neighboring atoms.\n\n3. **Debye Model for 2D Layers**:\n     - For the in-plane vibrational modes, since they occur on a 2-dimensional surface, their density of states differs from those in bulk materials.\n     - The number of normal modes per unit area up to frequency \\(\\omega \\) scales as:\n       \\[\n        g(\\omega)d\\omega = C_{2d} \\cdot A \\cdot d\\omega,\n      \\]\n      where \\(C_{2d}\\) is a constant related to the dimensionality and material parameters, and \\(A\\) represents the area of the system.\n\n4. **Energy Contribution Per Mode**:\n    - Each mode contributes energy according to the Bose-Einstein distribution function:\n      \\[\n         E_{\\text{mode}} = k_B T^2 \\int_0^{\\infty} x e^x /(e^{x}-1)^2 dx,\n      \\]\n\n5. **Total Energy Calculation**:\n    - Integrating over all frequencies gives us total internal energy contribution due to these modes:\n      \\[\n          U(T)=k_B T^2\\int_0^\\frac{\\theta_D}{T}dx\\frac{x^2}{(e^x-1)(1-e^{-x})},\n      \\]\n      where \\(\\theta_D\\) is the characteristic temperature associated with the highest possible phonon frequency.\n\n6. **Low-Temperature Approximation**:\n    - At very low temperatures (\\(T\\ll\\theta_D\\)), the upper limit of integration becomes effectively infinite because most contributions come from small values of \\(x\\). Thus:\n      \\[\n           U(T)\\approx k_B T^2 \\int_0^\\infty dx\\frac{x^2}{e^x(e^x-1)}.\n      \\]\n7. **Simplifying Integral**:\n    - This integral evaluates to a known value:\n      \\[\n            \\int_0^\\infty dx\\frac{x^2}{e^x(e^x-1)}\\approx 2\\pi^2/15.\n      \\]\n8. **Specific Heat Calculation**:\n    - Specific heat capacity \\(c_V=\\partial U/\\partial T\\), thus:\n      \\[\n             c_v=U/T\\approx k_B\\cdot\\left[\\frac{T}{\\Theta_D}\\right]^2\\cdot 2\\pi^2/15.\n      \\]\n\n9. **Conclusion**: Since the specific heat depends linearly on temperature \\(T\\):\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{c_v \\propto T}\n\\]"}

In the dilute gas regime (\\(d >> λ\\)) the leading-order effect comes from two-particle interactions mediated through the Pauli exclusion principle or symmetry requirements for bosonic wavefunctions.\n\nHowever, since we're dealing with bosons here, the primary effect arises from the enhancement of occupancy probabilities near zero energy levels.

Therefore, the net result manifests itself predominantly within the lowest accessible energy level(s), contributing minimally to the overall energy balance relative to the extensive kinetic component already computed.\n\nConsequently, the first-order difference in average energy between the two scenarios (distinguishable vs. indistinguishable boson gases) remains relatively minor but positive owing to enhanced ground-level occupancies characteristic of bosonic behavior.\n\nFinally, summarising the findings, the first-order difference in average energy between a system of \\(N\\) non-identical spinless particles and a system of \\(N\\) identical spinless bosons when \\(d \\gg \\lambda\\) is approximately:\n\\[\n\\Delta U \\approx kT\n\\]\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\Delta U=kT}\\)"}

In a metal, most low-energy states are already occupied by electrons. Therefore, scattering events where one electron transfers energy or momentum to another must involve transitions into higher unoccupied states.\n\n2. **Phase Space Considerations**:\n   For an electron to scatter off another electron, it needs to find an available phase space for both particles after the interaction. At low temperatures, many of these final states may not be accessible due to their occupation by other electrons. This reduces the probability of such collisions occurring frequently.\n\n3. **Screening Effects**:\n   Electrons in a metal screen each other's electric fields effectively over short distances. This screening effect weakens the Coulomb interactions between electrons, reducing the likelihood of close encounters leading to significant deflections.\n\n### Qualitative Argument for Temperature Dependence\n\nAs the temperature increases:\n- More thermal excitations occur.\n- Higher energy levels become populated.\n- There will be more empty states near the Fermi level which allows for increased availability of final states for scattered electrons.\n\nThis increase in available phase space leads to a greater number of possible electron-electron scattering events per unit time, thereby decreasing the mean free path $\\lambda_{ee}$.\n\nTherefore, we expect the electron-electron mean free path to decrease with increasing temperature because of the enhanced availability of final states for scattering processes.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Temperature Increase Leads To Decrease In } \\lambda_{ee}}\\]"}

Classical theory assumes that electrons behave like gas molecules, leading to predictions of very large electronic contributions to the specific heat, which were not observed experimentally.\n\nThis discrepancy arises from the fact that MB statistics do not account for the wave nature of electrons nor does it take into consideration the Pauli Exclusion Principle. In contrast, FD statistics correctly describe the behavior of electrons in metals by incorporating the Pauli exclusion principle, which limits the number of electrons that can occupy higher energy states. As a result, only a small fraction of electrons near the Fermi surface contribute to the specific heat, leading to a much smaller value consistent with experimental observations.\n\nThus, FD statistics resolved this issue by providing a more accurate description of electron behavior in metals, aligning theoretical predictions with empirical data.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{FD statistics accurately describes the behavior of electrons in metals, resolving discrepancies with experimental specific heat values}}\\]"}

", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "### Part (a): Explanation of Boltzmann Statistics, Fermi-Dirac Statistics, and Bose-Einstein Statistics\n\n#### Boltzmann Statistics:\nBoltzmann statistics apply to distinguishable particles that do not interact significantly with each other. The key assumption here is that the particles occupy distinct states independently.\n\n- **Indistinguishability**: Not applicable since it assumes distinguishable particles.\n- **Occupation Number**: Any non-negative integer \\( n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...\\)\n- **Probability Distribution**:\n\\[ P(n_1,n_2,...n_k)=\\frac{e^{-\\beta E}}{Z} \\]\nwhere \\(\\beta=\\frac{1}{k_B T}\\) ,\\(E\\) is total energy, and Z is partition function.\n\n#### Fermi-Dirac Statistics:\n\nFermi-Dirac statistics describe fermions which obey Pauli's exclusion principle: no more than one particle may exist in any given state.\n\n- **Indistinguishability**: Applicable; Fermions are indistinguishable from each other.\n- **Occupation Number**: Only 0 or 1 (\\( n_i=0,1\\)) due to Pauli’s exclusion principle.\n- **Probability Distribution**:\n\n\\[ f(E)= \\frac {1}{e^{\\beta (E-\\mu)} + 1}\\]\n\nWhere \\(f(E)\\) is probability distribution for occupation of single-particle state with energy \\(E\\),\\(\\mu\\) is chemical potential.\n\n#### Bose-Einstein Statistics:\n\nBose-Einstein statistics govern bosons, which can share the same state without restriction.\n\n- **Indistinguishability**: Applicable; Bosons are indistinguishable from each other.\n- **Occupation Number**: Any non-negative integer including zero(\\( n_i=0,1,2...)\\).\n- **Probability Distribution** :\n\n \\[ g(E)= \\frac {1}{e^{\\beta (E-\\mu)} - 1}\\]\n\n Where \\(g(E)\\) is probability distribution for occupation of single-particle state with energy \\(E\\).\n\nThe fundamental difference lies in how these statistics account for the indistinguishability of identical particles. For example, if we swap two identical particles described by either Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein statistics, there would be no change in the overall wavefunction because the particles are fundamentally indistinguishable. This leads to different statistical distributions compared to classical Boltzmann statistics where swapping particles results in a new configuration.\n\n### Part (b):\n\nAt very low temperatures, the behavior of particles governed by quantum statistics deviates significantly from those predicted by classical Boltzmann statistics. However, as the temperature increases, the thermal energy \\( k_{B}T \\) becomes much larger than the characteristic spacing between energy levels (\\(\\Delta E\\)). Under such conditions, the distinctions among the various quantum statistics become less important.\n\nTo understand this intuitively consider the following points:\n\n1. **Thermal Energy Dominance:** At high temperatures, the average kinetic energy of the particles is large enough so that many energy levels are accessible. Therefore, the detailed nature of the occupancy rules (whether particles follow Fermi-Dirac, Bose-Einstein, or Boltzmann statistics) does not matter as much.\n\n2. **Classical Limit Approximations:**\n    - For fermions, when \\( e^{\\beta (\\epsilon -\\mu ) } >> 1 \\), then \\( f(\\epsilon) \\approx e^{-β\\epsilon}\\). Similarly,\n    - For bosons, when \\( e^{\\beta (\\epsilon -\\mu ) } << 1 \\), then \\( g(\\epsilon) \\approx e^{-βε}\\).\n\n3. **High Temperature Behavior:**\n\nIn both cases, the exponential terms dominate over unity, making the expressions similar to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Thus, the system behaves classically even though the underlying particles might still technically adhere to quantum statistics.\n\n4. **Quantum Degeneracy Pressure**\n\nFor fermionic systems like electrons in metals, degeneracy pressure arises only below certain critical temperatures known as the Fermi temperature \\(T_F\\). Above \\(T_F\\), the electron gas behaves almost ideally according to classical laws.\n\n5. **Critical Temperatures**\n    - For typical gases under standard conditions, the transition occurs around room temperature (~300 K). For dense neutron stars, however, the relevant temperature scale could be millions of Kelvin.\n\nTherefore, the distinction between the three types of statistics becomes negligible at sufficiently high temperatures where all particles behave similarly regardless of whether they are fermions or bosons.\n\n### Part (c):\nWe need to determine the temperature range within which quantum effects must be considered significant for a collection of neutrons confined to a two-dimensional plane with a density of approximately \\(10^{12}/\\text{cm}^2\\).\n\nFirstly, let us calculate the de Broglie wavelength associated with the neutrons:\n\nGiven:\nDensity \\(N/A = 10^{12}/\\text{cm}^{2}\\)\n\nAverage distance between neutrons \\(d\\approx\\sqrt{\\frac{A}{N}} =\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{(10^{8})}}=10^{-6}m\\)\n\nDeBroglie Wavelength \\(\\lambda_d = h/p\\)\n\nMomentum p can be approximated using Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n\n\\[\\Delta x\\Delta p\\geq\\frac{h}{2\\pi}\\],\n\nAssuming \\(\\Delta x=d\\):\n\n\\[p\\sim\\frac{h}{\\pi d}=\\frac{(6.6\\times10^{-34})}{π×10^{-6}}\\]\n\nThus, De broglie wavelenght \\(\\lambda_d ≈7 ×10^{−9} m\\)\n\nNext, compare this length scale to the interparticle separation \\(d\\):\n\nSince \\(\\lambda_d < d\\), the neutrons exhibit classical behavior most of time but quantum effects start becoming noticeable when the thermal de Broglie wavelength approaches the mean interparticle distance.\n\nUsing the relation for thermal de Broglie wavelength:\n\n\\[\\lambda_T = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\hbar^2}{mk_BT}\\right)^{1/2}\\]\n\nSetting \\(\\lambda_T \\approx d\\):\n\n\\[d = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\hbar^2}{m k_B T}\\right)^{1/2}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(T\\):\n\n\\[T = \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar^2}{m k_B d^2}\\]\n\nPlugging in values:\n\n\\[T = \\frac{2\\pi(1.054 \\times 10^{-34})^{2}}{(1.67 \\times 10^{-27})(1.38 \\times 10^{-23})(10^{-12})^2}\\]\n\nThis gives:\n\n\\[T \\approx 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}K\\]\n\nSo, Quantum statistics should be used for describing the behaviour of neutrons in the temperature range up to ~$10^{-3}$ K.\n\nConclusion:\n\n\\[\\boxed{T<10^{-3}K}\\]"}

For each value of \\(m\\), the corresponding energy is \\(\\epsilon(N-m)\\).\n\n6. **Constructing the Sum**:\nThus, the sum over valid configurations becomes:\n\\[Z=\\sum_{m=0}^{N}e^{-(N-m)\\beta\\epsilon}=\\sum_{j=N}^0e^{(-j\\beta\\epsilon)}.\\]\n\n7. **Simplifying the Expression** :\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[Z=e^{\\beta\\epsilon N}(1+e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}+... + e^{(-\\beta\\epsilon)(N))}=e^{\\beta\\epsilon N}\\frac{(1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon})}{(1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon})}.\\]\n\n8. **Final Form**:\nTherefore, the partition function is:\n\\[\\boxed{Z=(1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon})(1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon})^{N}}.\\]]\n\n### Part (b): Average Number of Open Links when \\(\\epsilon\\gg\\tau\\)\n\nTo determine the average number of open links in the high-energy regime (\\(\\epsilon \\gg T\\)), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Probability Distribution**:\nWe start by finding the probability distribution of having \\(k\\) open links out of \\(N\\):\n\\[P(k)= \\frac{e^{-\\beta\\epsilon k}}{Z}.]\nSince \\(Z\\approx e^ {-\\beta\\epsilon N}\\) for large \\(\\epsilon\\), we get:\n\\[ P(k) =\\left(e^\\beta\\right)^k\\left(1-e^\\beta\\right)^{N-k}]\\]\n\n2. **Average Value Calculation**:\nThe expected number of open links is calculated using the expectation formula:\n\\[<k>=\\sum_k kP(k).]\n\n3. **Approximating the Expectation**:\nGiven the exponential decay nature of probabilities, most contributions come near \\(k=0\\):\n\\[ <k>\\approx\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}k\\frac{\\exp(-\\beta\\epsilon k)}{Z}\\]].\n\n4. **Using Geometric Series Properties**:\nRecognize that the series sums up to a geometric progression:\n\\[<k>= \\frac{d}{d\\beta}(\\ln(Z)).]\n\n5. **Differentiate Logarithmic Term**:\nTaking derivative yields:\n\\[<k>= -\\frac{N}{\\beta\\epsilon}.\\]]\n\n6. **High-Energy Limit Approximations**:\nIn the limit \\(\\epsilon>>T\\), the term \\(\\beta\\epsilon\\) dominates:\n\\[<k>\\approx Ne^{-\\beta\\epsilon}.\\]\n\nConclusion: Therefore, the average number of open links in the high-energy limit is approximately:\n\\[\\boxed{k\\approx Ne^{-\\beta\\epsilon}}\\]"}
