What is the radius of the inner sphere such that the electric field near its surface is a minimum?", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "Let's solve each part of the problem step-by-step.\n\n#### Part (a): Capacitance\n\n1.

Solving these equations under boundary conditions leads to:\n\\[R_a=b\\sqrt{\\frac{V-1}{V}}. \\]\n\nHence, the radius of the inner sphere so that the electric field near its surface is minimal is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{R_a=b\\sqrt{\\frac{V-1}{V}}} \\)."}

Therefore, the only way out is that the electric field must behave like a polar vector so that the flux through the surface becomes negative when the entire configuration is reflected about the origin.\n\nSimilarly, one can show that the magnetic field behaves like a pseudo-vector under reflection symmetry operations.\n\nHence, under a spatial inversion operation, the charge density and current density do not change whereas the electric and magnetic fields undergo the following transformations:\n\n\\[\n\\rho(\\mathbf{r},t)\\rightarrow\\rho(-\\mathbf{r},t)=\\rho\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{r},t)\\rightarrow\\mathbf{J}(-\\mathbf{r},t)=-\\mathbf{J}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r},t)\\rightarrow\\mathbf{E}(-\\mathbf{r},t)=-\\mathbf{E}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r},t)\\rightarrow\\mathbf{B}(-\\mathbf{r},t)=\\mathbf{B}\n\\]\n\n#### (d)\n\nTime reversal invariance implies that the laws governing physical phenomena should look exactly same even if we run them backwards in time. This means that the differential operator \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\) should get replaced with \\(-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\). However, there is another subtlety associated with this kind of transformation; namely, how do vectors and scalars behave under time-reversal?\n\nTo see why let us first examine the behavior of the electromagnetic potentials under time reversal. The potential four-vectors \\((A^{\\mu})\\) transform according to\n\n\\[\n(A^0,A^x,A^y,A^z)\\rightarrow(-A^0,A^x,A^y,A^z).\n\\]\n\nThis tells us that the scalar potential \\(A^0=-\\phi\\) flips sign under time reversal whereas the three components of the vector potential \\(\\mathbf{A}=(A_x,A_y,A_z)\\) stay put.

Similarly, using the relation between the magnetic field and the curl of the vector potential, we obtain\n\n\\[\nB_j(x,t)\\rightarrow B_j(-x,-t)=-B_j(x,t),\n\\]\n\nindicating that the magnetic field stays intact during time reversal.\n\nFinally, note that the charge density and current density transform respectively as\n\n\\[\n\\rho(x,t)\\rightarrow\\rho(-x,-t)=\\rho(x,t),\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,J_k(x,t)\\rightarrow J_k(-x,-t)=-J_k(x,t).\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a)} \\quad \\begin{cases}\n    \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0} \\\\\n    \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0 \\\\\n    \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = 0 \\\\\n    \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} - \\mu_{0} \\epsilon_{0} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t} = \\mu_{0} \\mathbf{J}\n   \\end{cases}\\\\ \\\\\n\n\\text{(b)}\\\\\n\\quad \\mathbf{E} \\to -\\mathbf{E},\\quad \\mathbf{B} \\to \\mathbf{B}.\\\\ \\\\\n\n\\text{(c)}\n\\quad \\rho\\to \\rho ,\\, \\mathbf{J}\\to -\\mathbf{J},\\, \\mathbf{E}\\to -\\mathbf{E},\\,\\mathbf{B}\\to \\mathbf{B}.\\\\ \\\\\n\n\\text{(d)}\n\\quad \\rho\\to \\rho ,\\, \\mathbf{J}\\to -\\mathbf{J},\\, \\mathbf{E}\\to -\\mathbf{E},\\,\\mathbf{B}\\to \\mathbf{B}.\n\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]"}

The first stage involves the lens acting on the incoming rays from the left.\n2. The second stage involves the mirror reflecting the rays back through the lens again.\n\n### (c) Image Distance and Linear Magnification for Each Stage\n\n#### First Stage (Lens):\nUsing the thin lens equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{d_i} = \\frac{1}{f_{\\text{lens}}} - \\frac{1}{d_o}\n\\]\nwith \\( d_o = 84 \\, \\text{m} \\) and \\( f_{\\text{lens}} = 42 \\, \\text{m} \\),\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{d_{i1}} &= \\frac{1}{42\\, \\text{m}} - \\frac{1}{84\\, \\text{m}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{2}{84\\, \\text{m}} - \\frac{1}{84\\, \\text{m}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{84\\, \\text{m}}\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore,\n\\[\nd_{i1} = 84\\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nThe linear magnification \\( m_1 \\) is given by:\n\\[\nm_1 = -\\frac{d_{i1}}{d_o} = -\\frac{84\\, \\text{m}}{84\\, \\text{m}} = -1\n\\]\n\nThis means the intermediate image formed after passing through the lens will be at infinity.\n\n#### Second Stage (Mirror):\n\nSince the intermediate image is at infinity, the object distance for the mirror is also effectively infinite. Therefore, using the mirror equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{d_{o,\\text{mirror}}} + \\frac{1}{d_{i,\\text{mirror}}} = \\frac{1}{f_{\\text{mirror}}}\n\\]\nwith \\( d_{o,\\text{mirror}} = +\\infty \\)\n\nWe find:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\infty} + \\frac{1}{d_{i,\\text{mirror}}} = \\frac{-1}{21\\, \\text{m}}\n\\]\n\nSolving gives us:\n\\[\nd_{i,\\text{mirror}} = -21\\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nThe linear magnification \\( m_2 \\) for the mirror is:\n\\[\nm_2 = -\\frac{f_{\\text{mirror}}}{d_{o,\\text{mirror}}} = -\\frac{-21\\, \\text{m}}{\\infty}= 0\n\\]\n\nHowever since the image was already at infinity before hitting the mirror, the effective magnification would still be zero as no change occurs when reflected off the mirror.\n\n### (d) Final Image Location and Total Linear Magnification\n\nAfter reflection from the mirror, the ray passes back through the lens. Since the image is at \\(-21\\) meters behind the mirror which is equivalent to being inside the lens, the lens does not affect its location anymore.\n\nHence, the final image is located at $-21$ meters relative to the original object side.\n\nTotal linear magnification is calculated as follows:\n\\[\nM = M_1 * M_2 = (-1)*(-1)=1\n\\]\n\nThe final image is therefore:\nReal, Inverted, Same size as the initial object.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Final Image Position:}-21\\,\\text {meters},\\text{Magnification}:1}\\]"}

{"id": "Electricity and Magenetism/6-2", "questions": "It may have occurred to you that since parallel currents attract, the current within a single wire should contract into a tiny concentrated stream along the axis. Yet in practice the current typically distributes itself quite uniformly over the wire. How do you account for this?
