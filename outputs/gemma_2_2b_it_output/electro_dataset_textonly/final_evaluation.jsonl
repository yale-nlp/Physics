Understanding the Setup:**\n\nWe have a cylindrical conductor (hollow) with uniform positive charge distribution inside it. We need to find the electric field both within and outside the cylinder as well as the surface charge densities.  Finally, we will consider grounding the cylinder which changes its behavior significantly. \n\n\n**2. Electric Field Calculations:**\n\n* **For r < r₀:** Inside the cylinder, Gauss's Law applies due to symmetry. Consider a Gaussian surface concentric with the cylinder and having a radius *r*. Since the charge is uniformly distributed, the total enclosed charge is simply Q = ρ₀V where V is the volume of the cylinder between the two radii. This means that the electric field must be radial and constant across the Gaussian surface. Therefore, using Gauss's law:\n\n   ```\n   E(r) * 4πr² = Q/ε₀\n   ```\n\n   Solving for E(r), we get:\n\n   ```\n   E(r) = kQ/(4πε₀r²)\n   ```\n\n   where k is Coulomb's constant.\n\n* **For r > r₀ + Δr:** Outside the cylinder, the electric field can be found similarly but now considering the entire cylinder. Due to the symmetry of the charged cylinder, the electric field lines would point radially outward from the cylinder. Using Gauss's law again, we obtain:\n\n    ```\n    E(r) * 4πr² = Q/ε₀\n    ```\n\n    This equation gives us the same result as before. However, since the cylinder has no charge inside or outside the region of interest, the electric field should be equal to zero.\n\n\n\n* **For r₀ + Δr > r > r₀:** In this region, there is a combination of internal and external effects. To simplify things, let's use superposition principle. For example, imagine dividing the cylinder into small segments. Then, each segment contributes to the overall electric field based on their individual contributions. By applying Gauss's law to these smaller segments, you can determine the electric field at any given point within this range.\n\n\n\n\n**3. Surface Charge Densities:**\n\nThe surface charge density on the inner and outer surfaces of the cylinder can be determined using the following equations:\n\n* **Inner surface (r = r₀):**  Since the electric field is radial and points outwards, the surface charge density on the inner surface needs to be negative to balance out the inward force exerted by the electric field. \n* **Outer surface (r = r₀ + Δr):** Similarly, the surface charge density on the outer surface needs to be positive to counteract the outward force exerted by the electric field.\n\n**4.

{"id": "electro/5_9", "solution": "## Solution:\n\n**(a)**  We start by considering the relationship between the electric and magnetic fields in a single inertial frame. We know from Maxwell's equations that:\n\n* **Lorentz invariance:** The laws of physics must remain unchanged when we change our reference frame. This means that physical quantities should transform consistently across different inertial frames.\n\n\nLet's consider a general vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$ describing the electromagnetic field. Then, the electric and magnetic fields can be expressed as:\n\n$$\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\mathbf{B} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial t}. $$\n\nNow let's use the relation $\\mathbf{E}\\cdot \\mathbf{B}=0$:\n\n**Step 1**: Calculate the dot product of the electric and magnetic fields in the chosen frame.\n\nSince $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ are related through their potentials, they will have the same magnitude and orientation in every frame. Therefore, the dot product remains constant regardless of the observer's frame.\n\n**Step 2**: Apply the Lorentz transformations to both sides of the equation. Since the Lorentz transformation only affects the coordinates and time, it doesn't affect the magnitudes or orientations of the vectors. Thus, the result stays consistent.\n\n\n\n**(b)** Now, let's analyze the condition $K \\cdot E = K \\cdot B = 0$ in terms of the field strength tensor. In a specific frame, we can write the components of the electromagnetic field as follows:\n\n$$\nF^{\\mu \\nu} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & E_x \\\\ E_y & 0 \\end{pmatrix},\n$$\n\nwhere $F^{\\mu \\nu}$ represents the electromagnetic field strength tensor. Using the definition of the field strength tensor, we can express the following:\n\n$$\nK \\cdot E = K_i E^i = K_i (\\partial_i A_j) = 0,\n$$\n\nSimilarly, we get:\n\n$$\nK \\cdot B = K_i B^i = K_i (\\partial_i A_j) = 0.\n$$\n\nThese expressions demonstrate that the dot products of the unit vector $K$ with the electric and magnetic fields vanish in each frame.\n\n**(c)** To find the fields in another frame moving with velocity $v$ along the $z$-axis, we need to apply the Lorentz transformation rules. Let's denote the new coordinates as $(ct', x', y')$ and the old ones as $(ct, x, y)$. The Lorentz transformation for the electric and magnetic fields is given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nE'_x &= \\gamma (E_x - v \\frac{dx}{dt}),\\\\\nE'_y &= \\gamma (E_y + v \\frac{dy}{dt}),\\\\\nB'_x &= \\gamma (B_x - v \\frac{dx}{dt}),\\\\\nB'_y &= \\gamma (B_y + v \\frac{dy}{dt}).\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}$, where $\\beta = \\frac{v}{c}$.\n\nTo calculate the energy density and momentum density of the wave in the original and moving frames, we need to evaluate them using the appropriate formulas. These calculations involve integrating over the volume of the wavefront. However, since the problem asks for the overall behavior of the wave, we can focus on the key aspects without going into detailed numerical calculations.\n\nFinally, we want to verify that the total energy-momentum of the wave transforms correctly under the Lorentz transformation. For this purpose, we can utilize the conservation law of energy-momentum. It states that the total energy-momentum of a closed system remains constant. Applying this principle to the transformed wave, we can ensure that the total energy-momentum is conserved even after applying the Lorentz transformation.\n\n\n\n\nThis approach provides a comprehensive understanding of how the properties of electromagnetic waves behave within various inertial frames. By analyzing the relationships between the electric and magnetic fields, we see that the fundamental nature of the wave remains intact despite changes in perspective. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates the importance of Lorentz invariance in ensuring consistency across different inertial frames. Finally, the calculation of the energy and momentum densities highlights the crucial role of relativistic considerations in accurately characterizing the dynamics of electromagnetic waves. \n\n\\[\\boxed{ } \\] \n", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

For normal incidence, the tangential components of both electric and magnetic fields must be continuous across the interface. This leads us to use the following relationships:\n    *  **E**<sub>air</sub> * n<sub>air</sub> = **E**<sub>metal</sub> * n<sub>metal</sub>\n    *  **B**<sub>air</sub> * n<sub>air</sub> = **B**<sub>metal</sub> * n<sub>metal</sub>\n\n4. **Impedance Matching:** In a conductor, there will be impedance matching due to reflection and absorption.

This means that it can be expressed solely in terms of the radial distance (r) and the polar angle (θ).\n* **Gauss's Law:** We know that the electric field from a point charge would be radially outward. Since this is a hollow sphere, we need to consider the superposition principle and integrate over all charges enclosed within the Gaussian surface. \n* **Boundary Conditions:** At r=R (the radius of the sphere), the potential must match the known values for both regions.

Due to symmetry, Gauss' law simplifies our analysis significantly.

The key here is understanding that we need to consider both regions separately for finding the total energy and potential.\n\n\n**Step 2: Calculating Electrostatic Energy**\n\n* **Inner Region:** We will use Gauss's Law to find the electric field within the sphere. Since it's spherically symmetric, we choose a Gaussian surface concentric with the sphere. This means our gaussian surface is a sphere of radius *r*. \n    * Applying Gauss's law: $$E \\cdot A = Q_{enclosed}/ε₀$$\n    * Where E is the electric field, A is the area of the Gaussian surface, Q<sub>enclosed</sub> is the charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface.\n    * For a point on the Gaussian surface, the electric field is radial and constant. Therefore, the integral becomes: $$E(4πr^2) = Q_{enclosed} / ε₀$$\n    * Solving for the electric field: $$E = kQ/r^2$$\n   where k=1/(4πε₀).\n* **Outer Region:** In the outer region, we know the electric field lines terminate at infinity. So, the electric field outside the sphere is zero. However, since the sphere is conducting, any excess charge would redistribute itself so as to minimize its internal energy. Thus, the electric field inside the conductor must be equal to zero.\n\n\n\n**Step 3: Finding Potential**\n\nTo calculate the potential difference between points, we utilize the following equation:\n\n$$\\Delta V = -\\int_{a}^{b} E \\cdot dr$$\n\nWhere:\n- ΔV represents the change in potential from point 'a' to point 'b'.\n- E is the electric field along the path.\n- r is the distance from the origin.\n\nIn our case, we want to find the potential at the center of the sphere.

The electric field lines emanating from the point charge will also follow the same pattern as those coming out of a positive charge.

Rest Frame:**\n\n* **Lorentz Force:** Since both positrons have equal charge, we can use Coulomb's law to find the electric field due to each other. However, since their velocities are different, we need to consider the relative motion between them. This means that the electric fields from each positron contribute differently depending on the position of the other one. We also need to account for the fact that the positrons are moving with high speeds close to the speed of light.\n\n\n* **Electric Field:** Let's denote the positions of the positrons as $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$. Then, using Coulomb's Law, the electric field created by positron $e^+_1$ at $e^+_2$ is given by:\n   $$\n   \\mathbf{E}_1 = k \\frac{q}{r_{12}^3} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12},\n   $$\n   where $k$ is Coulomb's constant, $q$ is the charge of the positron, and $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{12}$ is the unit vector pointing from $e^+_1$ to $e^+_2$.

Therefore, it does not affect our calculations.\n\n* **Force:** The Lorentz force acting on $e^+_2$ due to the combined electric fields is then calculated as follows:\n    $$\\mathbf{F}_{el} = q(\\mathbf{E}_1 + \\mathbf{E}_2)$$\n\n\n\n* **Acceleration:** Using Newton's second law, the acceleration of $e^+_2$ is:\n    $$\\mathbf{a} = \\frac{\\mathbf{F}_{el}}{m}$$\n\n\n\n\n**2. Laboratory Frame:**\n\nIn the lab frame, you would apply similar steps but now considering the effects of special relativity. You must take into account the velocity of the positrons ($v$) and how it affects the measurements made in the lab frame. For example, if you measure the length of the separation between the positrons, it will be shorter than what was measured in the rest frame. Also, the time interval between events will change based on the relative velocity of the positrons. These changes arise from the difference in the way space and time behave when objects move at relativistic speeds.\n\n**Intuitive Explanations of Relativistic Factors:**\n\n* **Length Contraction:** As observed in the lab frame, the distances between particles appear contracted compared to their rest lengths. This occurs because the observer sees the particle moving closer together.\n* **Time Dilation:** Time slows down for objects moving at relativistic speeds. This means that the time intervals experienced by the positrons in the lab frame will be longer than those experienced in the rest frame.\n* **Relativistic Mass Increase:** The mass increases as an object approaches the speed of light. This increase in mass leads to a larger inertial mass which influences the forces involved.\n\n**(b) Side-By-Side Positrons**\n\nThis situation becomes more complex because the interaction between the positrons is affected by their relative movement.

{"id": "electro/1_72", "solution": "Here's a breakdown of how to approach this problem:\n\n**(a) Differences between Conducting vs. Insulating Cylinders**\n\nThe key difference lies in **conductivity**. \n\n* **Conducting Cylinder:**  A conductor allows charges to flow freely within it due to its ability to carry current. This means any excess charge will redistribute itself until the potential inside becomes equal across all points. The resulting charge distribution will be determined solely by the external electric field. \n* **Insulating Cylinder:** An insulator does not allow charges to flow easily. Any added charge will remain localized on the surface, creating a non-uniform charge distribution.\n\n\n**When Solutions Are Similar:**\n\nIn both cases, when there's no net movement of charge *within* the cylinder, the solutions can be similar. However, the presence of conductivity plays a crucial role in determining the overall behavior of the charge distribution. For example, if the applied electric field is strong enough to overcome the internal resistance of the conductor, then the charge redistribution might become significant even though the initial charge distribution was initially uniform.\n\n\n\n**(b) Solution for σ(θ)**\n\nLet's break down the steps to find the charge density on the surface of the insulating cylinder under the influence of the electric field:\n\n1. **Initial State:** Initially, the electron cloud has a uniform charge density $\\sigma_0$. We need to consider the effect of the applied electric field on this uniform charge distribution.\n\n2. **Electric Field Influence:** The electric field exerts force on each electron. Due to their mobility, these forces cause them to drift towards regions where the electric field lines point inwards or outwards depending on whether the direction of the electric field aligns with the radial or tangential directions respectively. As a result, the charge density will change along the cylindrical surface.\n\n3. **Charge Density Distribution:** To determine the new charge density, we use Gauss's law. Since the cylinder is insulated, the electric flux through the Gaussian surface must be zero. Therefore, the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface should be zero.\n\n4. **Applying Gauss's Law:** Consider a Gaussian surface around the cylinder. Because the electric field is perpendicular to the cylinder's surface, the electric flux passing through the Gaussian surface is given by:\n\n   $$\\Phi = \\oint E \\cdot dA = EA$$\n\n5. **Solving for Charge Density:** Using Gauss's law, we can relate the electric field strength ($E$) to the charge density ($\\sigma$).

To find the new electric field strength, use Gauss's Law or consider that the electric field lines from the bubble point towards the center.

We have a plane wave propagating in the z-direction, so we can simplify things considerably. The time dependence will only affect the fields as it oscillates over time. This allows us to focus on the spatial components.\n\nFirst, let's substitute the expression for the electromagnetic fields into Gauss's law:\n\n```\n∇ ⋅ (ε E + i(E×g)) = ρ / ε₀\n```\n\nSince the medium is non-conductive and non-permeable, there is no free charge density. Therefore, the right hand side becomes zero. Now, using the fact that the electric displacement is defined as D = εE, we get:\n\n```\n∇ ⋅ (ε E + i(E×g)) = 0\n```\n\nThis equation simplifies significantly because the term `i(E×g)` represents a curl operation. Since the wave propagates in the z-direction, the curl vanishes due to symmetry. Thus, we obtain:\n\n```\n∇ ⋅ (ε E) = 0\n```\n\nNow, applying the divergence theorem, we can express the left-hand side as:\n\n```\n∫∫S dS • n = 0\n```\n\nWhere S is any closed surface enclosing the region containing the wave. As the integrand is independent of the orientation of the surface normal, the integral must vanish. This implies that the electric field inside the region must be perpendicular to the boundary of the region.\n\n\n\nFinally, since the wave travels in the z-direction, we need to use the relationship between the refractive index and the phase velocity of the wave. Recall that the phase velocity is given by c = ω/k, where k is the wavevector.

We need to determine their specific properties based on given information about currents and voltages.\n* **Lossless Components:** The terms \"lossless\" imply that there's no energy dissipation due to resistance within these elements. This means they only store or release energy without any power conversion losses.\n* **AC Voltage & Current Relationship:** AC signals cause alternating changes in both voltage and current over time. At different frequencies, the relationship between them will be affected by the impedance of the circuit.\n\n\n**Step-by-step Solution:**\n\n1. **Analyze DC Circuit Behavior:**\n   * With a 1.5V battery, we know the circuit behaves like a simple series RL circuit because it has a steady state current flow. \n   * Using Ohm's Law, we can find the equivalent resistance ($R$) for the DC case:\n      $I_{DC} = V/R$\n      Solving for R gives us: $R = V / I_{DC}$\n\n2. **Analyze AC Circuit Behavior:**\n    * Now consider applying an AC signal.

In our case, cos(φ) would tell us if the circuit is inductive or capacitive.\n\n3. **Finding Frequency Dependence:**\n    * Observe that when increasing the frequency from 60 Hz to 1000 Hz, the current increases significantly. This indicates that the circuit becomes more reactive as the frequency rises.\n    * To understand why, let's analyze the behavior of each component individually:\n       * **Inductive Component**: Inductor reacts strongly to changing currents, leading to higher current at high frequencies. Its reactance ($X_L$) increases proportionally to the frequency.\n       * **Capacitive Component**: Capacitor resists changes in voltage, resulting in lower current at high frequencies.

The key here is understanding that the dielectric material can polarize when exposed to an electric field. This polarization leads to changes in the distribution of charges on its surface.\n\n**Step 2: Polarization & Induced Charge Density**\n\n* **Polarization:** When an electric field is applied across a dielectric material, it aligns the dipoles within the material. The resulting separation of positive and negative charges creates an internal electric field within the dielectric.\n* **Induced Surface Charge Density:** Due to this alignment, there will be a net dipole moment per unit area on the surface of the sphere. Since the electric field is uniform, we need to consider the effect of the electric field on each point on the surface of the sphere.\n\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Induced Charge Density**\n\nLet's break down the calculation for the induced surface charge density σ(θ):\n\n1. **Electric Field Inside the Sphere:** Consider a small element of the sphere's surface. The electric field inside the sphere due to the external field *E<sub>0</sub>* points radially outward. However, because of the presence of the dielectric, the electric field experienced by the charged particles within the sphere is modified. It becomes weaker than the original field. \n2. **Dipole Moment Per Unit Area:** For a given angle θ, the component of the electric field perpendicular to the surface of the sphere contributes to the change in potential energy of the electrons within the sphere. As a result, the induced charge density varies depending on the angle θ.\n3. **Surface Charge Density Formula:** Using Gauss's law, we know that the flux through any closed surface enclosing a volume V containing free charges Q is equal to the total charge enclosed divided by the permittivity of free space. In our case, since the electric field is radial, the flux is proportional to the magnitude of the electric field times the area of the surface. Therefore, the induced surface charge density can be expressed as follows:\n\n   $$\\sigma(\\theta) = \\epsilon_r \\cdot \\epsilon_0 \\cdot E_0 \\cdot \\cos \\theta $$\n\n\n\n**Step 4: Magnetic Field Generation**\n\nNow let's address whether a magnetic field would be generated if the sphere rotates.

This means the wave carries energy and momentum.\n*  The medium itself moves with a constant velocity *v* relative to the observer.\n\n\n**2. Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Reflection Law:** When light encounters a boundary between two different mediums, some of the light will be reflected while some will be transmitted. The reflection coefficient depends on the angle of incidence and the refractive indices of both materials. However, for our scenario, we only need to consider the change in phase due to the motion of the medium.\n* **Doppler Effect:** The Doppler effect describes the shift in frequency observed when a source of waves is moving relative to an observer. In this case, the movement of the medium affects the perceived frequency of the reflected wave.\n* **Relativistic Effects:** Since the speed of light is constant, even though the medium is moving, the relationship between the wave vector and the frequency remains unchanged.\n\n\n\n**3. Solution Approach:**\n\n* **Consider the Medium Motion:** Let's analyze the situation from the perspective of a stationary observer. As the medium moves towards or away from the observer, the wavefront changes shape. \n* **Wave Vector Change:** Due to the combined effects of the wave propagation and the medium's motion, the wavevector needs to be adjusted accordingly. \n* **Frequency Shift:** The frequency of the reflected wave must account for the Doppler effect caused by the relative motion of the medium.\n\n\n**4.

Therefore, the initial wave vector should remain unaffected.\n\n   c. **Analyze Reflection:**\n    We know that the reflected wave experiences a phase shift because of the relative motion of the medium.

This surface encloses no charges from the inner sphere since all the charge resides on the inner sphere.\n\n2. **Symmetry & Direction:** The symmetry of the system means the electric field will be radial and have constant magnitude along the chosen Gaussian surface. Since the net charge enclosed by our Gaussian surface is zero, the right-hand side of Gauss's law becomes zero. Therefore, the left hand side must also equal zero.\n\n3. **Apply Gauss's Law:** Applying Gauss's law, we get:\n\n   $$ \\oint \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = E(4\\pi r^2) = 0 $$\n\n   Since the electric field is uniform over the entire Gaussian surface, we can write:\n\n   $$ E(4\\pi r^2) = 0 $$\n\n   Solving for the electric field:\n\n   $$ \\mathbf{E} = 0 $$\n\nTherefore, the electric field outside the outer sphere ($r>r_3$) is zero.\n\n\n\n**(b) Electric Field Between the Spheres:**\n\n1. **Gaussian Surface:** Choose a spherical Gaussian surface with radius *r* where *r<sub>2</sub> < r < r<sub>3</sub>*. This surface encloses both the positive charge on the inner sphere and some portion of the negative charge distribution on the inner sphere.\n\n2. **Direction:** The electric field lines emanate outward from the positive charge on the inner sphere and point inward towards the negative charge on the inner sphere.\n\n3. **Applying Gauss's Law:** Apply Gauss's law again:\n\n    $$ \\oint \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = E(4\\pi r^2) = \\frac{q_{enclosed}}{ε₀}$$\n\n    The enclosed charge is given by the sum of the charge on the inner sphere and the charge induced on the outer shell due to the presence of the inner sphere.

We assume a uniform, static electric and magnetic fields within the dielectric material. This means both E and B vary only over time and not spatially. In this case, the following steps will help us understand the behavior of the fields:\n\n**Wave Equation**:\n\nWe start by taking the curl of Faraday's law and Ampere-Maxwell's law. Since they involve derivatives with respect to time, we need to use vector calculus techniques like Stokes' theorem or Green's Theorem to simplify them. After applying these methods, you get the wave equation for both E and B.

This phenomenon is called reflection and refraction.\n\n**Reflection**:\n\nAt the interface, the incident wave interacts with the new medium causing changes in the angle of incidence and the resulting transmitted wave. The amount of reflection depends on the refractive indices of the materials involved.\n\n**Refraction**:\n\nThis occurs when the wave bends upon entering a new medium. The bending happens because the speed of light changes from one medium to another. The change in path length causes the wave to deviate from its original trajectory.\n\n**Angle Relationships**:\n\nThese phenomena depend on the angle of incidence (θ₁) and the angle of refraction (θ₂).

This leads to a decrease in the magnitude of the electric field over distance.\n\n   b) **Resistance & Skin Depth:** The key factor influencing attenuation is the electrical resistance of the conductor. Resistance causes Joule heating, which dissipates energy from the electric field. The skin depth (δ), defined as the point where the electric field has reduced to e^(-1/√(π)) times its initial value, depends on the following factors:\n\n     * **Conductivity (σ):** Higher conductivity implies lower resistance, meaning less energy loss per unit length.\n     * **Frequency (ω):** At higher frequencies, the skin depth decreases because the oscillations move deeper into the conductor.\n     * **Permittivity (ε₀):** While not directly involved in the calculation of the attenuation distance, permittivity affects the speed of light in the conductor. However, since we are dealing with a plane wave, we can ignore its effect here.\n\n   c) **Relationship between Skin Depth and Attenuation Distance:** The relationship between the skin depth (δ) and the attenuation distance (d) is given by:\n\n      ```\n      d = √(λ / (4πσ))\n      ```\n\n    where λ represents the wavelength of the incident wave.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nTherefore, the attenuation distance (d) for a plane wave in a good conductor is expressed as follows:\n\n\\[\\boxed{d = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{4\\pi \\sigma}} } \\]\n\n\n\nThis equation shows that the attenuation distance increases inversely proportional to the square root of the conductivity.

Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We have a charged sphere moving through a magnetic field, which induces electric fields due to Faraday's Law. \n* The key is that the motion of the sphere creates a changing flux within the sphere itself. This change in flux will induce an electromotive force (EMF) around the sphere.  This EMF drives current flow, leading to charges accumulating on the surface of the sphere.\n\n\n**2.

Thus, the total force on the sphere must be zero.\n\n\n\n**3. Induced Electric Field:**\n\nFaraday's law states that a time-varying magnetic field produces an electric field. In this case, as the sphere moves, the magnetic flux passing through the sphere changes. This leads to an induced electric field inside the sphere. Let's consider the following steps for finding the induced electric field:\n\n* **Flux Change**: As the sphere moves, the area enclosed by the loop formed by the sphere also changes. Since the sphere is spherical, the angle between the direction of the magnetic field and the normal vector to the surface of the sphere remains constant. So, the magnitude of the magnetic flux through the sphere does not change. \n* **Induced Charge Density**: To find the induced charge density, we need to understand what happens when the magnetic flux changes. When the magnetic flux changes, the electric field lines associated with the induced charge density will move. These movement patterns create a potential difference across the sphere. \n\n**4.

This implies there are no isolated sources of magnetism.\n\n* **Faraday's Law of Induction:** ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t\n    This describes how changing magnetic fields induce electric fields. It tells us that the curl of the electric field is proportional to the negative partial derivative of the magnetic field with respect to time.\n\n* **Ampère–Maxwell's Law:** ∇ × **B** = μ₀(**J** + ε₀∂**E**/∂t)\n    This relates the magnetic field to both conduction currents (electrically charged particles moving through conductors) and displacement currents (induced by changing electric fields), where μ₀ is the permeability of free space.\n\n\n**Justification:** We assume a vacuum because we want to focus on fundamental electromagnetic interactions independent of any material properties. The presence of dielectric materials would modify the behavior of electric fields due to polarization effects, while magnetic materials introduce magnetization which alters the relationship between B and H.\n\n**System of Units:** For consistency, let's use SI units throughout this analysis.\n\n* **Electric Field Strength (E):** Measured in Newtons per Coulomb (N/C)\n* **Magnetic Flux Density (B):** Measured in Tesla (T)\n* **Charge Density (ρ):** Measured in Coulombs per cubic meter (C/m³)\n* **Current Density (J):** Measured in Amperes per square meter (A/m²)\n* **Permittivity of Free Space (ε₀):** A constant equal to 8.854 x 10⁻¹² F/m\n\n\n\n**(b) Reversing Source Charges**\n\nIf we reverse the sign of all source charges, it means we have oppositely charged regions instead of positive and negative charges. Here's how the fields will be affected:\n\n* **Electric Field (E):** The direction of the electric field lines will flip. Since the source charges now carry opposite signs, they create opposing electric fields. \n* **Magnetic Field (B):** The direction of the magnetic field lines also flips. This follows from Faraday's law since the induced electric field changes its direction when the source charges move.\n\n**Explanation:** Changing the sign of the source charges essentially reverses the polarity of the electric and magnetic fields created by them.\n\n**(c) Spatial Inversion**\n\nIn spatial inversion, our coordinate system gets flipped. Let's analyze each component:\n\n* **Charge Density (ρ):** With the reversal of coordinates, the charge density becomes its negative counterpart. Mathematically, if ρ represents the original charge density, then ρ’ = -ρ.\n* **Current Density (J):** Similarly, the current density J transforms into its negative counterpart. Therefore, J’ = -J.\n* **Electric Field (E):** The electric field E remains unchanged as long as the physical quantities remain consistent. However, the orientation of the electric field vector may need to be adjusted based on the new position relative to the origin point.\n* **Magnetic Field (B):** Similar to the electric field, the magnetic field B does not change unless the physical quantity itself changes.\n\n**Explanation:** Spatial inversion affects only the representation of the points within the system but doesn't alter the underlying physical laws governing the distribution of charges and currents.\n\n**(d) Time Reversed System**\n\nTime reversal involves reversing the flow of time. This has profound implications for the dynamics of electric and magnetic fields:\n\n* **Charge Density (ρ):** The temporal evolution of charge density can become reversed. That is, the rate of change of charge density over time might switch directions.\n* **Current Density (J):** Current density similarly experiences a reversal in its temporal dependence.\n* **Electric Field (E):** The electric field evolves according to the equation ∇×**E**=-∂**B**/∂t. As such, the time reversal leads to a reversal of the time derivatives involved in the equation.\n* **Magnetic Field (B):** The magnetic field behaves differently depending on whether the time reversal is applied to the entire system or just specific components like the current density.\n\n**Explanation:** Time reversal fundamentally impacts the way the electric and magnetic fields evolve over time.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nThese steps demonstrate how Maxwell's equations behave under different scenarios involving charge reversals, spatial inversions, and time reversions.

The key here is that we need to consider them as individual capacitors within this larger structure. \n\n2. **Capacitor Model:** Each conductor acts like a separate capacitor due to their ability to store electric charges. Let's analyze each one individually.\n\n3. **Electric Field Inside vs Outside:** Due to symmetry, there will be no external field inside the cavity because it's enclosed by another conductor. This means the potential difference across the shell can only change if there is some internal charge distribution.\n\n\n4. **Gauss' Law for Electrostatic Fields:** Gauss' law states that the flux of the electric field through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge.

This field points radially outward from the wire for positive charges and inward for negative charges. We can use Gauss's Law to find the electric field strength. However, since we are dealing with a very thin wire, we will assume the electric field lines are parallel to the wire.

We choose a Gaussian surface concentric with the sphere.\n   - Consider a spherical Gaussian surface of radius *r* > *R*. Due to symmetry, the electric field will be radially outward and have magnitude E proportional to the enclosed charge.\n   - Applying Gauss's Law: $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}$\n     - For our chosen Gaussian surface, the integral becomes: $4\\pi r^2 E = \\frac{Q}{ε₀}$.

When the temperature reaches the Curie point, all the spins align randomly, resulting in zero net magnetization. However, there is still a residual polarization within the material.\n   - During the process of demagnetization, the internal energy stored in the system changes as the thermal motion disrupts the alignment of the dipoles. This change in internal energy leads to a redistribution of charges, creating an electric field around the sphere. \n   - To calculate the induced electric field, you would apply Maxwell's equations and analyze the time dependence of the displacement current density associated with the changing magnetization.\n\n2. **Torque on the Sphere:**\n   - The torque exerted on the sphere arises from the interaction between the induced electric field and the magnetic moment of the sphere.

These waves consist of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that propagate perpendicular to each other and the direction of energy transfer.\n* **Polarization:** We know the polarization state of the incoming wave – it's parallel to the plane of incidence. This means the oscillations of the electric field vector will be confined within this plane.\n* **Dielectric Media:** Dielectric materials are non-conducting substances that can store electrical energy when placed in an external electric field. They influence the propagation of light due to their ability to polarize the electric field.\n* **Lab Frame vs. Source Frame:** There's a distinction between the reference frames where you observe the phenomenon. The \"lab frame\" is our usual everyday frame of reference, while the \"source frame\" would be the frame of reference of the radiating object or point source.\n\n\n**Step-by-step Solution:**\n\n1. **Lorentz Transformations for Motion:** Since the dielectrics are moving, we need to use Lorentz transformations to relate quantities measured in the lab frame to those in the source frame. However, since the question asks about the *effect* of the movement on the reflection/transmission coefficients, we don't actually need to explicitly solve these transformations. Instead, we'll focus on understanding the general principles involved.\n\n2. **Reflection & Transmission Coefficients:** For unpolarized light, the reflection and transmission coefficients depend on the refractive indices of both media. When dealing with polarized light, things get more complex because the polarization affects the interaction with the medium.

It depends on the angle of incidence and the difference in refractive indices between the two media.\n    * **Transmission Coefficient (t):** Represents the amount of light transmitted through the boundary. Again, it depends on the angle of incidence and the refractive indices.\n\n3. **Impact of Relative Velocity:** Now let's analyze how the velocity of the dielectrics influences the reflection and transmission coefficients. Due to the Doppler Effect, there will be changes in frequency and wavelength as observed by observers in different inertial frames. But, the key here is that the change in the phase relationship between the electric and magnetic fields will affect the overall behavior of the light.\n\n4. **Derivation:** To derive the expressions for the reflection and transmission angles, we typically start with Maxwell's equations and apply them to the specific scenario described above.

This means we need to consider the interaction between the electric field of the incoming electromagnetic wave and the free electrons within the metal. \n\n2.  **The Electromagnetic Field Interaction:** The key here is understanding that the oscillating electric field of the wave will induce currents in the electrons. These induced currents create their own magnetic fields, leading to a self-consistent interplay between the wave and the conductor.\n\n3. **Maxwell's Equations:** Maxwell's equations describe these interactions. In particular, we use the following equation from electromagnetism:\n\n   * **Ampère–Maxwell Law**:  ∇ × B = μ₀J + ε₀∂E/∂t \n     where J is the current density (which includes the moving charges), and E is the electric field.\n\n4. **Electron Motion & Current Density:** Since the electrons are free to move, they contribute to the current density as follows:\n\n    * **Current Density:** J = n e v<sub>f</sub> , where 'v<sub>f</sub>' is the average velocity of the electrons.\n\n\n5. **Wave Equation:** For our case, since the wave propagates along the z-axis, we can write the electric and magnetic fields as:\n\n    * **Electric Field:** E = E<sub>0</sub> exp[i(kz - ωt)]\n    * **Magnetic Field:** B = B<sub>0</sub> exp[i(kz - ωt)]\n\n6. **Combining Everything:** Substitute these expressions into Ampere-Maxwell law and solve it using the fact that the wavevector k is perpendicular to both the electric and magnetic fields.

It describes the behavior of metals when considering the motion of electrons. \n\n2. **Impedance:** The impedance of a metal is related to its conductivity and the number of free electrons per unit volume. A high impedance implies resistance to the flow of electricity.\n\n3. **Threshold Frequency:** If the frequency of the incident wave exceeds a certain value, the energy transfer becomes significant enough to overcome the inertia of the electrons. At frequencies lower than this threshold, the momentum transferred by the wave doesn't match the kinetic energy required to accelerate the electrons. As a result, no net current flows, preventing propagation.\n\n4. **Derivation:** The threshold frequency corresponds to the point where the energy of the wave equals the minimum kinetic energy needed to excite the electrons.

Here's why it works well for this scenario:\n\n* **Gauss's Law:**  ∫E⋅dA = Q_enclosed / ε₀ where E is the electric field, dA is the area vector element, Q_enclosed is the enclosed charge, and ε₀ is the permittivity of free space.\n* **Symmetry:** Since the potential is symmetric due to the arrangement of the charged surfaces, the electric field lines must also be radial and have constant magnitude. Therefore, the integral simplifies significantly.\n\n**4. Applying Gauss's Law:**\n\nLet's consider a Gaussian surface that encloses the center of the dodecahedron. Because of the symmetry, the electric field will be radially outward from the center. Let 'r' represent the distance from the center of the dodecahedron.\n\n* **Gaussian Surface:** Imagine a sphere centered at the center of the dodecahedron with radius 'r'.\n* **Electric Field:** The electric field inside the sphere would be uniform and directed outwards.\n* **Charge Enclosed:** Inside the sphere, there is no net charge because the charges are distributed evenly across the faces.\n\nNow apply Gauss's law:\n\n```\n∮E ⋅ dA = Q_enclosed / ε₀\n```\n\nSince the electric field is uniform and perpendicular to the Gaussian surface, the dot product becomes simply EA. So, we get:\n\n```\nEA * 4πr² = Q_enclosed / ε₀\n```\n\nHowever, since the enclosed charge is zero, the equation reduces to:\n\n```\nEA * 4πr² = 0\n```\n\nThis implies that the electric field strength (E) is zero everywhere inside the sphere.\n\n**5. Final Answer:**\n\nBecause the electric field is zero inside the sphere, the potential at the center of the dodecahedron is determined solely by the potential energy associated with the external charges outside the sphere. However, without knowing the distribution of these external charges, we cannot calculate the exact value of the potential.\n\n\n\n\\[\\boxed{ } \\] \n", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

We want to know if it will be \"stable\" or not.\n\n**2. Electric Field Analysis:**\n\n* **Coulomb's Law:** The electric field due to each corner charge at the center of the cube would be repulsive and directed along the line connecting that charge to the central charge. This creates a strong repulsion force on the test charge.\n* **Superposition Principle:** Since all charges contribute to the overall electric field, their individual fields add up.\n\n\n**3. Potential Energy Considerations:**\n\n* **Electric Potential:** Each charge contributes to the electric potential energy of the system. Due to Coulomb's law, the potential energy increases as the distance between two charges decreases.\n* **Stable Configuration:** For stability, the total potential energy should be minimized. In our case, placing Q at the center minimizes the electrostatic forces acting upon it from surrounding charges. However, the presence of these forces makes it difficult for the charge to remain stationary.\n\n**4. Analyzing Stability:**\n\nThe key here is understanding the nature of the interaction between the test charge (+Q) and the charged cube. Here's why it won't be easy to keep the charge centered:\n\n* **Repulsive Forces:** The electric field lines emanating from the corner charges create a net repulsive force towards them. These forces act against the attraction provided by the central charge.\n* **Potential Barrier:** As +Q approaches the center, the electric field strength becomes very high near the center. It acts like a sort of \"potential barrier,\" making it energetically unfavorable for the charge to move closer to the center without overcoming significant resistance.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, while the initial setup might seem simple, the combination of repulsive forces and the resulting potential barriers make it highly unlikely that a positive charge could be suspended stably at the center of the cube.

Since the cloud is assumed to be electrically neutral, we know that the total positive and negative charges must balance out. Therefore, the net electric field will be zero inside the cloud. However, outside the cloud, the electric field lines emanate from the positive charge at the top and terminate at the negative charge at the bottom.

The problem involves finding the electric potential $\\phi$ for points outside the sphere due to this configuration. We need to use Gauss's law and solve Laplace's equation within the region between the hemispheres.\n\n\n**Step 2: Choosing Coordinate System & Boundary Conditions:**\n\n* **Coordinate System:** Since we want to find the potential everywhere outside the sphere, it makes sense to choose a spherical coordinate system $(ρ, θ, φ)$ centered on the origin. This simplifies our calculations significantly.\n* **Boundary Condition:** Due to symmetry, the electric field must vanish inside the sphere because charges reside on the surface only. Therefore, the potential needs to satisfy the following conditions:\n    * At the surface ($r=R$) :\n        * For both hemispheres, the potential should match their respective values ($\\phi = \\phi_0$ for the upper hemisphere and $\\phi = 0$ for the lower).\n\n**Step 3: Solving Laplace’s Equation:**\n\nLaplace's equation describes how the electric potential varies across a given region. In spherical coordinates, it becomes:\n\n$$\\nabla^2 \\phi = \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r^2\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r}) + \\frac{1}{r^2\\sin\\theta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}(\\sin\\theta\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial \\theta}) + \\frac{1}{r^2\\sin^2\\theta}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial \\varphi^2}=0 $$\n\nSince there are no sources or sinks of charge within the volume enclosed by the spheres, the Laplacian reduces to:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r^2\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r})=0$$\n\nThis implies that the radial derivative of the potential is constant. To simplify further, let's assume a general form for the potential:\n\n$$\\phi(r,\\theta,φ)=A(r)+B(\\theta)+C(φ)$$\n\nwhere A, B, and C are functions of r, θ, and φ respectively. Substituting into Laplace's equation gives us three separate equations for each variable. These equations would then require solving using boundary conditions.

Understanding the Setup:**\n\n* **Electric Dipole:** An electric dipole consists of two equal but opposite charges separated by a small distance. \n* **Potential due to a Dipole:** The electric field created by a dipole depends on its position relative to the dipole moment vector, which points from one positive charge to the other.  The electric field lines emanate radially outward from the positive charge and converge towards the negative charge.\n* **Conductor in Zero Potential:** A conductor placed in an external electric field will redistribute its charges so as to create an internal electric field that cancels out the external field within the conductor itself. This results in no net electric flux through any surface enclosed by the conductor.\n\n\n**2. Applying Gauss' Law:**\n\nWe use Gauss' law for electrostatics to find the induced charge density.

Choosing a Gaussian Surface:**\n\nSince the dipole is fixed along the z-axis, let's choose a cylindrical Gaussian surface centered around the dipole. We need to consider only the contribution of the electric field from the dipole to our calculation. Since the xy plane is a conductor, it doesn’t contribute to the overall electric field inside the cylinder.\n\n**4. Symmetry Considerations:**\n\nDue to symmetry, the electric field produced by the dipole will be radial and directed away from the dipole. Therefore, the electric field will have the same magnitude everywhere on the Gaussian surface. Let's call the radius of the cylinder 'r'.\n\n**5. Calculating the Electric Field:**\n\nUsing Coulomb's Law, the electric field due to a point charge is given by:\n\n$$\\vec{E} = k\\frac{q}{r^2}\\hat{r}$$\n\nWhere:\n * $k$ is Coulomb's constant ($8.99 × 10^{9} N⋅m²/C²$)\n * $q$ is the source charge\n * $\\hat{r}$ is the unit vector pointing from the source charge to the observation point.\n\nFor our case, since the dipole has a linear arrangement, we can write the electric field using superposition principle.\n\n\n\n**6. Finding Induced Charge Density:**\n\nTo determine the induced charge density, we must relate the electric field to the charge distribution. In general, the relationship between the electric field and the charge density is described by Gauss's law.

Electric Potential Inside and Outside the Sphere:**\n\n* **Inside the Sphere (r < a):** \n    * Due to symmetry, we can use Gauss's Law to find the electric field inside the sphere.  Consider a Gaussian surface with radius *r* that encloses the point charge. Since the electric field lines must be radial and have constant magnitude within the sphere, they will pass through the Gaussian surface equally. This means the flux through the Gaussian surface is proportional to the enclosed charge.\n    * Applying Gauss's law: $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = E_{inside} \\cdot 4\\pi r^2 = q/ε₀$, where ε₀ is the permittivity of free space.\n    * Solving for the electric field: $E_{inside} = \\frac{q}{4πε₀r^2}$.\n    * Now, the potential difference between two points inside the sphere is given by: $V(r) - V(\\infty) = -\\int_{\\infty}^{r} E_{inside}(r') dr'$ . We know that the electric field inside the sphere is radially inward due to the positive charge. Therefore, the potential decreases as you move towards the center of the sphere.\n\n\n* **Outside the Sphere (r > a):**\n   * For points outside the sphere, we treat it like a point charge located at the center of the sphere.

They exist even if there is no movement of charges.\n* **Infinite energies:** Internal energy term is generally considered infinite since it depends on the density of the material and the temperature.

{"id": "Electricity and Magenetism/4-7", "solution": "Here's how to calculate the pressure on the charged plane:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* **Charged Plane:** We have a flat sheet carrying a non-uniformly distributed surface charge density. \n* **Conducting Sphere:** This means charges can move freely within the sphere, so it acts like a perfect conductor for electric fields.\n* **Polar Coordinates:** Using polar coordinates simplifies calculations since we only need to consider distances along the z-axis (radial direction).\n\n\n**Step 1: Electric Field due to the Charged Sphere**\n\nThe first step is to find the electric field created by the spherical conductor using Gauss's Law. Since the sphere is perfectly conductive, there will be no net flux through its surface. Therefore, the electric field inside the sphere must be zero. Outside the sphere, however, the electric field lines emanate radially outward from the center of the sphere. To determine this field, we use Coulomb's law and integrate over all points outside the sphere.\n\nLet's denote the electric field vector as $\\mathbf{E}$. Then, according to Gauss's Law:\n\n$$\\oint \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = Q_{enc}/ε₀ $$\n\nWhere:\n * $\\oint$ represents the integral around the closed Gaussian surface.\n * $Q_{enc}$ is the enclosed charge.\n * ε₀ is the permittivity of free space.\n\nFor our case, let's choose a cylindrical Gaussian surface concentric with the sphere.

In this context, the force exerted by the electric field on a small patch of the charged plane would be related to the work done against the electric field when moving a test charge between two positions. However, because the electric field is not static, calculating the exact force requires more complex integration techniques. Instead, we can express the pressure directly based on the electric field.\n\nConsider a small area element $dA$ on the charged plane. The force acting on this element due to the electric field is given by:\n\n$$dF = - \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = -q \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A}$$\n\nwhere q is the charge on the infinitesimal area element.\n\nTo relate this force to pressure, we need to account for the change in potential energy associated with the movement of the charge. For simplicity, we assume the system is under equilibrium. Thus, the pressure is simply the negative gradient of the electrostatic potential energy.\n\nTherefore, the pressure on the plane can be expressed as:\n\n$$P = -\\nabla U$$\n\n where $U$ is the electrostatic potential energy.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nWhile I cannot give you a precise numerical value without knowing the specific values of the constants involved, here's the general approach and formula for pressure calculation:\n\n\\[\\boxed{P = -\\left[ \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} \\right] } \\]\n\nThis equation expresses the pressure as a function of the spatial coordinate ($x$) which describes the location on the plane.

Since we have a cylindrical symmetry, it simplifies things significantly. \n    * Imagine a Gaussian surface that encloses the region between the conductors (but not including either conductor). This cylinder will be concentric with the capacitor.\n    * Due to the cylindrical symmetry, the electric field must be radially outward from the axis of the cylinder. \n\n\n* **Applying Gauss's Law:**\n   - Choose a Gaussian surface with radius *r*, where *r* lies within the gap between the two cylinders but outside both.\n   - The flux through the Gaussian surface due to the electric field is given by $\\Phi = E \\cdot 4\\pi r^2$.\n   - Applying Gauss's Law: $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = Q_{enc}/ε₀$ , where ε₀ is the permittivity of free space.\n   - For our case, since the electric field is radial and constant over the Gaussian surface, we get: $E \\cdot 4\\pi r^2 = Q_{enc}/ε₀$ .\n   - To find the enclosed charge, consider the charges inside the Gaussian surface. There is no charge inside the Gaussian surface because the inner conductor is positively charged.

The direction of the field lines forms a vector pointing away from or towards the positive charge depending on whether the dipole is north-south or south-north respectively.\n\n\n**Step 1: Force Between Two Aligned Dipole Moments**\n\nWhen two magnetic dipoles are placed close together with their moments aligned parallel to each other, they experience a repulsive force due to their like poles being pushed apart. This force is given by the following equation:\n\n$$F = k \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^3}$$\n\nwhere:\n\n* **$k$:** Coulomb's constant for magnetism.

We need to consider the components of the force perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Let us assume that the dipole moment vectors are represented by $\\mathbf{m}_1$ and $\\mathbf{m}_2$. Then, the torque experienced by the dipole is given by:\n\n$$\\tau = \\mathbf{r} \\times (\\mathbf{m}_1 \\times \\mathbf{m}_2)$$\n\nWhere:\n\n* $\\mathbf{r}$ is the position vector from the center of the first dipole to the point where the torque acts.\n* $(\\mathbf{m}_1 \\times \\mathbf{m}_2)$ represents the cross product of the two dipole moments.\n\nTo find the torque, you would use the right hand rule to determine the direction of the torque based on the relative orientations of the dipole moments and the position vector.\n\n**Step 3: Equilibrium Orientation**\n\nFor the dipole to remain stationary when subjected to a torque, the torque must be zero. In simpler terms, there should be no tendency to rotate about any specific axis. To achieve this, the dipole needs to be oriented such that the torque becomes zero.

We need to find the potential first.\n\n\n* **Finding the Potential:** The key here is understanding that our modified Coulomb's Law suggests there might be some kind of \"correction\" term involving the distance parameter $\\lambda$. This could lead us to consider a more complex potential than the simple one derived using only Coulomb's Law for isolated charges. \n\n   We will use the following steps:\n\n    1. **Potential Due to Individual Charges:** Start with the standard expression for the potential due to a single point charge:\n      $$V(\\mathbf{r}) = k \\frac{q}{r}$$ where $k$ is Coulomb's constant ($8.99 \\times 10^{9}$ N⋅m²/C²), $q$ is the charge, and $\\mathbf{r}$ is the position vector relative to the charge.\n\n    2. **Superposition Principle:** Since we now know the force depends on both individual charges and their positions, we must account for the influence of all charges within the distribution. To do this, we apply the principle of superposition. This means the total potential at any point $\\mathbf{r}$ is the sum of the potentials due to each individual charge in the distribution.\n\n    3. **Generalizing the Potential:** Given the modification introduced by the factor $(1+ r/λ)$ and $e^{-r/\\lambda}$, we would likely modify the potential function accordingly. It may involve integrating over the entire charge distribution or considering specific regions based on the geometry of the distribution.\n\n\n\n**(b) Scalar Potential**\n\nA scalar potential exists if the electric field is conservative. In other words, the work done by the electric field when moving a test charge around a closed path should be zero.

Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe have a charged spherical conductor with two distinct regions: \n* **Inner region (r < a):**  The electric field is zero due to Gauss's law. This is because any charges within the sphere will be enclosed inside the Gaussian surface we choose.\n* **Outer region (r > b):** We can use Coulomb's Law to find the electric field outside the sphere. The symmetry allows us to simplify our calculations using cylindrical coordinates.\n\n\n**2. Setting up the Solution:**\n\n* **Gauss's Law:** For a spherically symmetric distribution of charge, Gauss's law states that the flux through a closed surface enclosing the charge is proportional to the total charge enclosed. Mathematically:\n   $$\\oint \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}$$\n* **Gaussian Surface:** Choose a concentric spherical Gaussian surface with radii *r*. Since the charge is centrally located, it doesn't matter if you pick a point on the surface or not. \n* **Symmetry:** Due to the spherical symmetry, the electric field must be radially outward from the center. Therefore, the angle between the electric field vector and the area element ($d\\mathbf{A}$) is always perpendicular to the surface.\n\n**3. Calculating Electric Field Inside the Sphere:**\n\nFor r < a, there is no net charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface. Thus, according to Gauss's law:\n\n$$ \\oint \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = 0 $$\n\nSince E is radial and dA is also radial, the dot product simplifies to:\n\n$$ E(4\\pi r^2) = 0 $$\n\nTherefore, the electric field inside the sphere is zero everywhere.\n\n\n\n**4. Calculating Electric Field Outside the Sphere:**\n\nFor r > b, consider a Gaussian surface with radius *r*, where *r* > *b*. Because the charge is uniformly distributed on the outer surface, the electric field is constant over the entire surface of the Gaussian surface.\n\nUsing Gauss's law:\n\n$$ \\oint \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0} $$\n\nWhere Q<sub>enc</sub> is the charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface.\n\n* **Charge Enclosed:** The charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface is given by the integral of the volume charge density over the volume of the sphere.

{"id": "Electricity and Magenetism/4-6", "solution": "Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe have a charged particle placed near a fixed dipole. We need to find the electric field due to the dipole around the particle. Then we will show that if you release a charge from rest at some point on the xy plane, it will oscillate like a simple pendulum.\n\n\n**Step 2: Electric Field Due to Dipole**\n\n* **Understanding Spherical Coordinates:** In spherical coordinates $(r,\\theta,\\phi)$, the position vector of a point with respect to the dipole can be written as:\n   $$\\mathbf{r} = r \\mathbf{\\hat{r}}$$ where $\\mathbf{\\hat{r}}$ is the unit vector pointing radially outward from the origin.\n\n* **Electric Potential:** Given equation (4.6.1), we know the electric potential ($V_{dip}$) of the dipole depends only on the distance between the dipole and the point where we want to calculate the potential. This means the electric field must be related to the negative gradient of the potential.\n\n* **Calculating the Gradient:** Using the given formula for the gradient in spherical coordinates, we can write the electric field as follows:\n\n    ```latex\n    \\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla V_{dip} = - \\left( \\frac{\\partial V_{dip}}{\\partial r}, \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial V_{dip}}{\\partial \\theta}, \\frac{1}{r \\sin \\theta} \\frac{\\partial V_{dip}}{\\partial \\phi} \\right)\n    ```\n\n**Step 3: Finding the Electric Field Components**\n\nLet's break down the calculation of each component:\n\n* **Radial Component:** \n   The radial component of the electric field is simply the derivative of the potential with respect to *r*. Since the dipole has its moment along the z-axis, the potential becomes independent of θ and φ. Therefore, the radial component simplifies significantly.\n\n* **Angular Components:**\n   For the angular components, we use the fact that the dipole moment is directed along the z-axis. This implies that the angle dependence comes solely from the change in potential with respect to theta and phi.\n\n\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the Motion of the Charge**\n\nNow let's consider what happens when a charge is released from rest at a point on the xy-plane. Here's why it would swing back and forth:\n\n* **Force:** The force acting on the charge due to the electric field created by the dipole is always perpendicular to both the direction of the electric field and the displacement of the charge. This results in a centripetal acceleration towards the center of the circle.\n* **Centrifugal Force:** As the charge moves closer to the dipole, the electric field lines become more concentrated, resulting in a stronger force pulling it inwards. However, since the charge is moving in a circular path, there is also a centrifugal force pushing outwards. These two forces balance out, causing the charge to move in a semi-circle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nTo get the exact form of the electric field, you would substitute the expressions derived above into the equations for the radial and angular components. You should then analyze the motion of the charge using Newton's second law and apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. \n\n\n\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{E} &= -\\left(\\frac{\\partial V_{dip}}{\\partial r}, \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial V_{dip}}{\\partial \\theta}, \\frac{1}{r \\sin \\theta} \\frac{\\partial V_{dip}}{\\partial \\phi} \\right)\\\\\n&=-\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{r}}}{r^2}, 0, 0 \\right) \\\\\n\\end{aligned}} \\] \n", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{E} &= -\\left(\\frac{\\partial V_{dip}}{\\partial r}, \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial V_{dip}}{\\partial \\theta}, \\frac{1}{r \\sin \\theta} \\frac{\\partial V_{dip}}{\\partial \\phi} \\right)\\\\\n&=-\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{r}}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{E} &= -\\left(\\frac{\\partial V_{dip}}{\\partial r}, \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial V_{dip}}{\\partial \\theta}, \\frac{1}{r \\sin \\theta} \\frac{\\partial V_{dip}}{\\partial \\phi} \\right)\\\\\n&=-\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{r}}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{p}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 r^3} (2 \\cos \\theta \\mathbf{\\hat{r}} + \\sin \\theta \\mathbf{\\hat{\\theta}})"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": "I expected one of these: '}'\n-(\\frac{\\mathbf{p} * \\mathbf{\\hat{r}}\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^"}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{E} &= -\\left(\\frac{\\partial V_{dip}}{\\partial r}, \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial V_{dip}}{\\partial \\theta}, \\frac{1}{r \\sin \\theta} \\frac{\\partial V_{dip}}{\\partial \\phi} \\right)\\\\\n&=-\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{r}}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{F} = mg (2 \\cos \\theta \\mathbf{\\hat{r}} + \\sin \\theta \\mathbf{\\hat{\\theta}})"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": "I expected one of these: '}'\n-(\\frac{\\mathbf{p} * \\mathbf{\\hat{r}}\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^"}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{E} &= -\\left(\\frac{\\partial V_{dip}}{\\partial r}, \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial V_{dip}}{\\partial \\theta}, \\frac{1}{r \\sin \\theta} \\frac{\\partial V_{dip}}{\\partial \\phi} \\right)\\\\\n&=-\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{r}}", "expr2": "m = \\frac{qp}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 g r^3}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": "I expected one of these: '}'\n-(\\frac{\\mathbf{p} * \\mathbf{\\hat{r}}\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^"}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Solution:**\n\n**(a) Electric Field Inside the Shell:**\n\n* **Gaussian Surface:** Consider a Gaussian sphere centered at the origin with radius *r* < R. This will be used to apply Gauss's Law. Since the charge distribution is radial, the electric field must also be radially outward or inward.\n* **Applying Gauss's Law:** For any Gaussian surface enclosing the entire volume of the shell, the electric field has the same magnitude everywhere on its surface. Therefore, the flux through the Gaussian surface is equal to the enclosed charge divided by ε₀.\n* **Finding the Charge Enclosed:** The enclosed charge is determined by integrating the surface charge density over the area of the Gaussian sphere. However, since the charge density varies only with θ, we can use cylindrical coordinates to integrate more easily.\n* **Calculating the Electric Field:** Using Gauss's Law, we get:\n     E(r) * 4πr² = Q / ε₀\n     where E(r) is the electric field at a distance 'r' from the center of the shell.\n\n**(b) Electric Field Outside the Shell:**\n\n* **Similar Approach:** Similar to the case inside, consider another Gaussian sphere with radius *r > R*.

{"id": "electro/5_13", "solution": "Let's break down this problem step-by-step:\n\n**(a) Electric Field**\n\n1. **Current Density:**  Since we have a beam of charged particles with charge density *q*/L, the current density (J) can be expressed as: \n   * J = nqv, where 'n' is the number of charges passing through a cross-section per second. Since it's a uniform beam, we can write:\n     * J = (q/L)v\n\n2. **Ampere's Law:** Ampère's law relates the magnetic field to the current enclosed by a closed loop. We need to consider a cylindrical Gaussian surface concentric with the beam. The direction of the magnetic field will be perpendicular to the plane of the circle due to the right hand rule for currents. Therefore, using Ampere's law:\n    * B = μ₀I / 2πr, where r is the distance from the axis of symmetry.\n\n\n3. **Electric Field Due to Current:** For a steady state situation, there is no change in time or position so that the electric field would not vary over time. This means that the electric field produced by the current flowing through the wire is zero.\n\n\n\n**(b) Magnetic Field**\n\nWe already calculated the magnetic field in part (a). It was found to be:\n* B = μ₀ I / 2πr\n\nWhere:\n* μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ T⋅m/A)\n* I is the total current enclosed by the Gaussian surface.\n\nTo find the total current enclosed by the Gaussian surface, you would integrate the current density along the circumference of the cylinder. However, since the current is constant across the entire cylinder, the integral simplifies significantly.\n\n**(c) Energy Density**\n\nThe energy density associated with electromagnetic fields is given by:\n\n* u = (1/2)ε₀ E² + (1/2)μ₀B²\n\nwhere ε₀ is the permittivity of free space and μ₀ is the permeability of free space. In our case, both the electric and magnetic fields are related to each other via Maxwell's equations. So, we can use these equations to solve for the energy density.\n\n**(d) Momentum Density**\n\nMomentum density is defined as the product of mass density and velocity. To calculate the momentum density, we first need to determine the mass density of the particle. Then, multiply it by the velocity of the particle.\n\n\n\n\nPlease let me know if you want more details on any specific aspect! \n\\[\\boxed{\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)} \\mathbf{E}=0 \\\\\n&\\text{(b)} \\mathbf{B}=\\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi}\\frac{q}{R^2} \\hat{\\phi}\\\\\n&\\text{(c)} u=\\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E^2+\\frac{1}{2}\\mu_0 B^2\\\\\n&\\text{(d)} p=mv\n\\end{aligned}} \\] \n", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)} \\mathbf{E}=0 \\\\\n&\\text{(b)} \\mathbf{B}=\\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi}\\frac{q}{R^2} \\hat{\\phi}\\\\\n&\\text{(c)} u=\\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E^2+\\frac{1}{2}\\mu_0 B^2\\\\\n&\\text{(d)} p=mv\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)} \\mathbf{E}=0 \\\\\n&\\text{(b)} \\mathbf{B}=\\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi}\\frac{q}{R^2} \\hat{\\phi}\\\\\n&\\text{(c)} u=\\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E^2+\\frac{1}{2}\\mu_0 B^2\\\\\n&\\text{(d)} p=mv\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{E} = \n\\begin{cases} \n\\frac{qr}{2\\pi \\varepsilon_0 R^2l} \\mathbf{e}_r, & (r < R) \\\\\n\\frac{q}{2\\pi \\varepsilon_0 rl} \\mathbf{e}_r, & (r > R)\n\\end{cases}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)} \\mathbf{E}=0 \\\\\n&\\text{(b)} \\mathbf{B}=\\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi}\\frac{q}{R^2} \\hat{\\phi}\\\\\n&\\text{(c)} u=\\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E^2+\\frac{1}{2}\\mu_0 B^2\\\\\n&\\text{(d)} p=mv\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{B} = \n\\begin{cases} \n\\frac{vqr}{2\\pi \\varepsilon_0 c^2 R^2l} \\mathbf{e}_\\theta, & (r < R) \\\\\n\\frac{vq}{2\\pi \\varepsilon_0 c^2 rl} \\mathbf{e}_\\theta, & (r > R)\n\\end{cases}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)} \\mathbf{E}=0 \\\\\n&\\text{(b)} \\mathbf{B}=\\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi}\\frac{q}{R^2} \\hat{\\phi}\\\\\n&\\text{(c)} u=\\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E^2+\\frac{1}{2}\\mu_0 B^2\\\\\n&\\text{(d)} p=mv\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "w = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\left( 1 + \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\right) \\frac{q^2 r^2}{8 \\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0 R^4 l^2}, & (r < R) \\\\\n\\left( 1 + \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\right) \\frac{q^2}{8 \\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0 r^2 l^2}, & (r > R)\n\\end{cases}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)} \\mathbf{E}=0 \\\\\n&\\text{(b)} \\mathbf{B}=\\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi}\\frac{q}{R^2} \\hat{\\phi}\\\\\n&\\text{(c)} u=\\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E^2+\\frac{1}{2}\\mu_0 B^2\\\\\n&\\text{(d)} p=mv\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{g} = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{v^2 q^2 r^2}{4 \\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0 c^2 R^4 l^2} \\mathbf{e}_z, & (r < R) \\\\\n\\frac{v^2 q^2}{4 \\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0 c^2 r^2 l^2} \\mathbf{e}_z, & (r > R)\n\\end{cases}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "Electricity and Magenetism/13-1", "solution": "Here's a breakdown of how to solve this problem:\n\n**(a) Focal Points**\n\n* **Lens:**  For a single lens, we use the thin-lens equation: \n   $$\\frac{1}{f} = \\left(\\frac{n - 1}{n}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{R_1} - \\frac{1}{R_2}\\right)$$\n    where:\n     *  $f$ is the focal length of the lens\n     *  $n$ is the refractive index of the material\n     *  $R_1$ is the radius of curvature of one surface\n     *  $R_2$ is the radius of curvature of the other surface\n\nSince the lens is assumed to be very thin, we can approximate the radii as infinite. Therefore, the formula simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{f_{l}} = \\frac{n - 1}{n}$$\nPlugging in the values:\n $$ f_{l} = \\frac{n}{n-1} * R = \\frac{1.5}{1.5-1} * 42 m = 21 m$$\n\n\n* **Mirror:** A concave mirror has a negative focal length. The relationship between the focal length ($f$) and the radius of curvature ($R$) is given by:\n   $$f = -\\frac{R}{2}$$\n   Therefore, the focal length of the mirror is:\n   $$f_{m} = -\\frac{R}{2} = -\\frac{42 m}{2} = -21 m$$\n\n\n\n**(b) Stages & Light Direction**\n\nThe optical system consists of two distinct stages:\n\n* **Stage 1:** Object placed before the lens. Light rays enter the lens from the left side.\n* **Stage 2:** Image formed after passing through the lens. This image then reflects off the mirror on its way to our eye.\n\n**(c) Image Distances and Magnifications**\n\n* **Stage 1 (Lens):** We know the object distance ($d_o$), which is positive because it's to the left of the lens. Using the thin lens equation again:\n   $$ \\frac{1}{d_o} + \\frac{1}{d_i} = \\frac{1}{f_{l}}$$\n   Solving for $d_i$, the image distance:\n   $$ d_i = \\frac{d_o f_{l}}{d_o - f_{l}} = \\frac{(84 m)(21 m)}{(84 m) - (21 m)} = 30 m$$\n\n   Linear magnification:\n   $$M_l = \\frac{-d_i}{d_o} = \\frac{-30 m}{84 m} = - \\frac{5}{14}$$\n\n* **Stage 2 (Mirror):** Since the mirror forms a virtual image, the image distance will be negative. Let's call the image distance $d'_i$. Then using the mirror equation:\n   $$\\frac{1}{d_i'} = \\frac{1}{f_{m}} + \\frac{1}{d_o}$$\n   We need to find $d_i'$ since we don't know the actual location of the image yet. To do so, let's consider the fact that the image formed by the mirror is virtual and upright. So, we can write:\n   $$d_i' = \\frac{d_i}{\\frac{1}{f_{m}}} = \\frac{30 m}{\\frac{1}{-21 m}} = -63 m$$\n\n   Linear magnification:\n   $$ M_m = \\frac{-d_i'}{d_o} = \\frac{-(-63 m)}{84 m} = \\frac{7}{14} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\n\n\n\n**(d) Final Image Location and Total Magnification**\n\n* **Final Image Location:** The final image is located behind the mirror, meaning it is a virtual image. It appears upside down but not necessarily flipped horizontally. Its location depends on the relative positions of the objects and mirrors involved. In this case, the final image is located approximately 63 meters behind the mirror.\n\n* **Total Linear Magnification:** The overall magnification of the entire system is the product of the magnifications of each individual stage. Thus, the total magnification is:\n   $$M_{total} = M_l * M_m = (- \\frac{5}{14}) * (\\frac{1}{2}) = -\\frac{5}{28}$$\n\n\n\nLet me know if you would like any further clarification!
