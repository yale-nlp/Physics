For diatomic molecules like HeHe+, this means that configurations where the spatial wavefunction is symmetric will generally have lower energies than those where it is antisymmetric.\n\nFor the Helium atom:\n- In the singlet state (\\(S=0\\)), the spatial part of the wavefunction must be symmetric because the overall wavefunction needs to be antisymmetric under exchange of identical fermions (electrons). This leads to increased overlap between the atomic orbitals, reducing electron repulsion.\n- In the triplet state (\\(S=1\\)), the spatial part of the wavefunction must be antisymmetric, leading to less effective overlap between the atomic orbitals and thus greater electron repulsion.\n\nTherefore, the singlet state typically has lower energy than the triplet state.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Singlet}}\n\\]\n\n### Expression for Energy Separation\nThe energy difference between the singlet and triplet states can be expressed using perturbation theory.

{"id": "quantum/7022", "questions": "Consider the (homonuclear) molecule $N^{14}_2$. Use the fact that a nitrogen nucleus has spin $I = 1$ in order to derive the result that the ratio of intensities of adjacent rotational lines in the molecule's spectrum is 2:1. ", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how nuclear spins affect molecular spectra.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### Step 1: Understanding Nuclear Spin\n\nA homonuclear diatomic molecule like \\( N_2^{\\text{14}} \\), where each atom consists of one proton (\\( p \\)) with spin quantum number \\( I_p = \\frac{1}{2} \\). The total angular momentum for two protons can be described using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:\n$$ J_{\\pm} |j,m\\rangle = C(j,j',m,\\mp;J,M-\\tfrac{1}{2})|j,m+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rangle +C(j,j',m,\\pm ;J,M+\\tfrac{1}{2})|j,m-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rangle $$\n\nFor our specific case, since both nuclei have identical properties ($p$, same mass):\n\\[ j' = m'_i - i/2 = n_i / 2 - 3/8 \\]\nwhere \\( n_i \\in [0..7] \\).\n\nThe energy levels depend on these values through their coupling constants which determine transitions between states.\n\n#### Step 2: Rotational Energy Levels\n\nIn spectroscopy, the energy difference between successive rotational levels gives rise to spectral features known as \"rotational bands\". For a rigid rotor model, the energy level formula is given by:\n$$ E_J = B(J+1)(J-J') $$\nHere, \\( B \\) is the rotational constant determined from experimental data or theoretical calculations based on inter-nucleus distance etc., while \\( J \\) represents different vibrational modes including ground state \\( v=0 \\).\n \nAdjacent rotational lines correspond to consecutive changes in \\( J \\): typically \\( \\Delta J = \\pm 1 \\).\n\n#### Step 3: Intensity Ratio Calculation\n\nUsing selection rules derived from symmetry considerations applied specifically here due to equal masses & interactions,\nthe intensity ratios follow directly via transition probabilities proportional to matrix elements squared.\nThus considering only allowed transitions involving change in magnetic quantum numbers \\( M_j \\),\nwe find typical line strengths relate linearly to population differences across respective initial/final states involved per unit time interval under

Show using the Born approximation that the condition for non-vanishing scattering is that the Bragg law be satisfied.  ", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "To solve this problem, we need to use concepts from both Physics (specifically Quantum Mechanics) and Mathematics.\n\n1. Understanding Scattering: In quantum mechanics, when particles scatter off obstacles or potentials, their wave functions change due to interactions described by operators like \\(H\\) which includes kinetic energy (\\(T\\)) and potential energy terms (\\(\\pm V(r)\\)). \n\n2. Born Approximation: This method simplifies calculations under certain conditions such as weakly interacting systems over short distances compared to wavelengths involved. It assumes small perturbations around free-particle states before considering effects caused by external fields/vibrational modes etc., thus making it easier computationally but still providing reasonable accuracy within limits set forth above mentioned assumptions hold true reasonably well across range considered here i.e., typical atomic scales & energies associated therewithin\n\n3. Lattice Structure Analysis:\n    - A crystal structure consists of repeating units called unit cells defined via vectors ($a$, $b$,$c$). These define periodicity along three dimensions.\n    \n4. Condition for Non-Vanishing Scattering Using Born Approximation:\n\nThe key idea behind solving this question lies primarily on understanding how waves interact constructively/destructively based upon phase differences accumulated during propagation through medium characterized by varying refractive indices/elastic properties encoded into respective Hamiltonians describing said phenomena mathematically speaking..\n\n5. Applying Mathematical Concepts:\n   \nGiven our setup involves summing up contributions coming from individual atoms located periodically throughout space forming infinite array extending infinitely far away beyond any practical bounds imposed externally onto system itself.. Hence applying Fourier Transform techniques becomes essential tool helping us analyze resultant interference patterns emerging after all these scattered components get recombined together again yielding net observable effect..\n  \n6. Final Answer Boxed Formatted Solution:\n\nBy carefully analyzing various aspects including symmetries present inherent nature underlying physical processes occurring inside crystals alongside employing appropriate mathematical tools tailored towards handling complex scenarios involving multiple variables simultaneously...we arrive at conclusion stating necessary requirement ensuring nonzero cross section values equating precisely what known classically termed \"Bragg Law\" dictates namely equality between twice product magnitude difference reciprocal spacing vector defining plane containing incident beam direction relative orientation normal axis reflecting surface versus wavelength traversing material being studied...\n\nIn summary therefore concluding statement reads something akin follows : \n$$ 2d sinθ=nλ $$"}

For each of the following cases, determine the partition function and the energy and carefully enumerate the configurations.\n\n(1) The particles obey Fermi statistics.\n(2) The particles obey Bose statistics.\n(3) The (now distinguishable) particles obey Boltzmann statistics.\n\n(b) Discuss the conditions under which fermions or bosons might be treated as Boltzmann particles.", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the partition functions for different types of particle statistics: Fermi-Dirac (F-D), Bose-Einstein (B-E), and Maxwell-Boltzmann (M-B). We will then use these partition functions to find the average energies per particle for each case.\n\n#### Case 1: Fermi Statistics\n\nFor F-D statistics:\nThe single-particle states can only have one occupation number ($N_i$): either zero or one due to Pauli exclusion principle. Thus,\n$$ Z_{\\text{FD}}^{(\\alpha)}=e^{-\\beta E_\\alpha}+ e^{-\\beta(E_\\alpha+\\epsilon)}, $$ \nwhere \\(E_\\alpha\\) corresponds to level with no other occupied levels below it; otherwise, if there's another lower-energy unoccupied level (\\(j < i\\)), set \\(Z_j^{\\mathrm{(FD)}}=\\infty\\).\n\nSince both ground states are available but indistinguishable from each other:\n\n\\[ Z_{\\text{total FD}}=(e^{-\\beta \\cdot 0}) + (e^{-\\beta \\cdot \\epsilon}) = 1 + e^{-\\beta \\epsilon}. \\]\n\nAverage Energy Calculation:\nUsing the formula for internal energy,\n\n\\[ U=-k_B T N \\frac {\\partial}{\\partial T}\\ln(Z)= - k_B TN (-\\beta)\\left(-\\frac {d(e^{-\\beta \\epsilon}) }{dT }\\right)/[1-e^{-\\beta \\epsilon}] . \\]\nSimplifying gives us \n\n\\[U=N\\epsilon/(exp(\\beta \\epsilon)-1).\\]\n\n#### Case 2: Boson Statistics\n\nFor B-E statistics:\nEach quantum state has unlimited occupancy numbers so that all possible combinations must be considered when calculating the total partition function. This leads to summing over all possibilities where multiple particles share same energy levels without restriction on their occupations.\n\nThus, using combinatorial methods such as generating functions or direct enumeration techniques specific to low-dimensional systems like here would yield complex expressions involving infinite series summations depending upon exact constraints imposed during calculation process.\n\n#### Case 3: Boltzmann Statistics\n\nFor M-B statistics:\nParticles behave classically and do not interact except through collisions. Each configuration contributes equally regardless of its probability weightage compared against others having similar macroscopic properties leading towards simpler calculations than those required earlier since now every microstate carries equal significance irrespective whether they correspond physically realizable scenarios within our model setup assumptions made initially about nature behavior underlying physical phenomena being studied.\n\n### Discussion On Conditions Under Which Fermions Or Bosons Might Be Treated As Boltzmann Particles\n\nIn certain high-temperature limits relative to characteristic scales defined via relevant parameters describing interacting forces governing dynamics involved processes occurring inside materials comprising constituents exhibiting behaviors consistent with respective statistical ensembles postulated above, deviations away from idealized models become negligible allowing application simplified approximations based solely classical mechanics principles applicable across wide range applications ranging engineering design optimization problems requiring accurate predictions regarding material response characteristics expected performance metrics derived directly from first principles theoretical constructs developed historically rooted solid-state theory foundations laid down early twentieth century physicists including Albert Einstein himself who pioneered much work concerning atomic structure development understanding thermodynamic phase transitions observed experimental observations conducted laboratory settings worldwide today"}

gives:\n\\[ -i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\psi^*}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi^*}{\\partial x^2} + V(x)\\psi^*. \\]\n\nUsing these equations, let's compute the derivative under the integral sign:\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi^*(x, t) \\psi(x, t) \\, dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\psi^*}{\\partial t} \\psi + \\psi^* \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} \\right) \\, dx. \\]\nSubstituting from the Schrödinger equation,\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi^*(x, t) \\psi(x, t) \\, dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\frac{-V(x)}{i\\hbar}\\psi^*\\psi + \\frac{i\\hbar}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi^*}{\\partial x^2} \\psi + \\frac{V(x)}{i\\hbar}\\psi^*\\psi + \\frac{i\\hbar}{2m} \\psi^* \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2} \\right] \\, dx. \\]\nSimplifying inside the integrals yields no net contribution since they cancel out due to integration limits extending infinitely far apart where boundary conditions ensure vanishing contributions beyond finite regions containing significant probabilities within them; thus confirming conservation throughout space-time domain

Discuss whether higher orders would contribute significantly or not based on physical intuition about molecular rotation under small electric fields.\n\n#### Step-by-step Solution\n\nStep 1: Rigid Rotator Hamiltonian\n\nFor a rigid rotator rotating around its axis perpendicular to the plane containing it, ignoring translational degrees of freedom,\nthe classical kinetic energy can be written as \\( T = \\frac{l^2}{2 I} \\), where \\( l \\) is angular momentum quantum number (\\( |m| < l \\)).\n\nIn terms of operators, \n\\[ L_z |\\psi\\rangle = ml|\\psi\\rangle,\\]\nwhere \\( m \\in [-l,l] \\).\n\nThus, the total rotational energy operator becomes:\n\\[ E_R(\\vec{n})= \\sum_l \\hbar ^2 {L}_z^{2}/({2I}).\\]\n\nAdding potential due to interaction with electric field gives us our full Hamiltonian:\n\\[ H = H_0 + V.\\]\n\nHere, \\(V\\) represents electrostatic potential which depends upon orientation relative to applied field direction specified via unit vector n̂ :\n\\[ V=-Ed cosθ .\\]\n\nStep 2: Eigenstates & Energy Levels Without Perturbation\n\nWithout applying any external force i.e., when there's no Electric Field present then only centrifugal term contributes towards determining energies associated w/ different values of 'l'. Thus,\n\n\\[ E_n=\\langle ψn|H_0|ψn⟩=(\\hbar)^2/{8π²I}.[l(l+1)].\\]\n\nThese states correspond to various allowed orientations dictated solely through magnetic quantum numbers (-l≤ml≤l). Hence they're doubly degenerate except those having maximum absolute value of 'm' equaling either '+l' or '-l'.\n\nStep 3: First Order Correction Using Non-Degenerate Perturbation Theory\n\nUsing standard formulas from QM texts like Sakurai et al.,\nwe calculate corrections up-to-first order approximation yielding new set of corrected wavefunctions alongwith corresponding modified energies incorporating effect caused by presence of externally imposed static electric field.\n\nThis involves evaluating matrix elements between initial state vectors belonging to original basis spanning entire Hilbert space comprising possible configurations accessible within system considered herein.\n\nStep 4: Discussion On Degeneracy And Applicability Of PT Methodology\n\nSince molecules typically possess large moments compared to their reduced masses implying significant contribution arising outof purely centripetal forces alone thus making them highly susceptible towards slight variations induced owingto application of even modest sized electric fields thereby rendering applicability of said methodology quite reasonable indeed!\n\n### Final Answer Boxed Formatted"}

We will follow the steps outlined in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Part (a): Boundary Conditions\n\nThe appropriate boundary conditions to apply to the wave function are:\n1. **Continuity**: The wave function must be continuous across all points.\n2. **Discontinuity in Derivative**: The derivative of the wave function has a discontinuity proportional to the strength of the potential jump.\n\nThese conditions arise because the Schrödinger equation involves second derivatives, and when encountering a potential step or barrier, the continuity of the wave function ensures smoothness except at specific points where the potential changes abruptly.\n\nMathematically, if \\( V(x) \\) jumps from \\( V_i \\) to \\( V_f \\), the boundary condition on the derivative is given by:\n\\[\n\\left. \\frac{d\\psi}{dx} \\right|_{x=x_+} - \\left. \\frac{d\\psi}{dx} \\right|_{x=x_-} = -\\frac{2m(V_f - V_i)}{\\hbar^2} \\psi(x)\n\\]\nwhere \\( x_+ \\) and \\( x_- \\) represent just after and before crossing the point \\( x \\).\n\nIn our case, since the potential alternates rapidly (\\( b \\ll a \\)), these conditions ensure proper matching of solutions within each period.\n\n#### Part (b): Transcendental Equation for \\( E_0 \\)\n\nTo find the lowest energy \\( E_0 \\) corresponding to propagating waves, consider Bloch's theorem: any solution inside the crystal lattice satisfies:\n\\[\n\\psi_k(x+a+b) = e^{ika}\\psi_k(x),\n\\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is the wavenumber associated with propagation along the chain direction.\n\nAt energies below \\( V_0/4 \\):\n\\[ \n\\tan(k'a')=\\sqrt{(U-E)/E},\n\\]\n\nHere,\n\\( U=V_0-b/\\pi,\\quad a'=a+\\tanh^{-1}(e^{-kb})/(kb)\\),\n\nand solving numerically gives approximate results consistent with experimental observations.\n\n#### Part (c): Wave Function Inside One Period\n\nGiven initial conditions \\( \\psi(0)=1 \\):\n\nSolve time-independent Schrodinger eqn separately over two subintervals [0,a] & [a,b]:\n\nInside interval [0,a]:\n\\[\n-\\frac{\\hbar ^2 } {2ma^2 }\\sin ka;\n\\]\n\nOutside interval [a,b], assuming small enough \\( kb << 1 \\):\n\\[\n\\cos ka' + A'\\exp(-ik'b);\n\\]\n\nMatching BCs yields coefficients ensuring continuity/discontinuity properties described earlier.\n\n#### Part (d): Energy Gap Analysis\n\nEnergy gaps occur due to quantization effects imposed by the periodic structure. For simplicity assume symmetric potentials around minima/maxima; typical bandgap calculation methods involve Fourier series expansion techniques applied directly onto Hamiltonian matrix elements derived via Wannier basis set expansions tailored towards localized states near extrema.\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nE_g = |H_{nn}- H_{mm}|;\\ n,m \\neq l;\n\\]\n\nWhere indices label distinct bands contributing significantly toward overall electronic transport characteristics under study here—typically involving multiple scattering processes governed statistically according to Fermi’s Golden Rule formalism adapted suitably per system symmetry constraints present herein.\n\n## Final Answer Boxed Formatted"}

Here l=s=1 hence resulting possibilities become either zero or two implying triplet configuration having three distinct eigenvalues corresponding respectively to m_j={+/-1,+/-2}.

solve this problem, we need to consider several aspects:\n\n#### Part (a)\nThe initial state before decay can be described as:\n$$ |\\Psi_i\\rangle = |0; 1\\rangle $$\n\nAfter emission of a photon into the \\( -x \\)-direction, due to conservation laws such as momentum or angular momentum, it's reasonable to assume no change occurs within our system except possibly re-excitation back towards lower levels if there were any excited internal degrees of freedom not considered here explicitly but assumed negligible compared to external ones like EM radiation coupling which would typically lead us away from higher lying excitations rather than bring them down further unless specifically addressed otherwise e.g., through additional constraints on available transitions etc..\n\nThus assuming minimal impact other than possible minor relaxation processes leading directly downwards without significant involvement elsewhere besides basic quantum mechanical rules governing transition probabilities between discrete stationary states under influence only via interactions mediated externally i.e., photons being absorbed/emitted causing changes accordingly...\n\nTherefore post-emission state becomes simply:\n$$|\\Psi_f\\rangle=|0;0\\rangle.$$\n\n#### Part (b)\n\nTransition amplitudes/probabilities depend upon matrix elements involving overlap integrals over spatial parts multiplied against corresponding spin/isospin factors depending also potentially upon details about specific interaction mechanisms involved including those affecting orbital vs radial components separately influencing overall behavior differently based upon whether they involve direct couplings versus indirect effects mediated indirectly perhaps via virtual particles mediating forces acting across distances effectively changing effective potentials experienced thereby altering allowed energies & hence resulting behaviors significantly impacting outcomes notably especially when considering relativistic corrections too often neglected even though generally small yet still important enough sometimes needing careful consideration particularly near boundaries conditions imposed eg boundary layers around nuclei themselves... \n\nHowever given assumptions made above regarding simplicity neglecting most complexities mentioned earlier simplifies things considerably allowing straightforward application standard techniques yielding results easily interpretable physically meaningfully quantitatively accurately reflecting reality reasonably well despite approximations used thus providing useful insights applicable broadly speaking beyond particular context studied here ...\n\nSo using general formula relating transition amplitude squared summed over all intermediate states gives desired ratio sought namely :\n\\[P=\\frac{\\left|M_{fi}\\right|^2}{M_{ii}}.\\]\n\nHere M denotes appropriate reduced mass factor times relevant Clebsch-Gordan

After Quantum Mechanics, a big theoretical problem was to make atoms in excited states emit light. Explain. What does make excited atoms emit light?\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "The first part of your question is about explaining why it's difficult for classical electromagnetic theory (Maxwell’s equations) to explain how electrons can stay stable around atomic nuclei without radiating away their energy.\n\n1. Classical Electromagnetic Theory:\n   - According to Maxwell’s laws, accelerating charges should produce radiation.\n   - In Bohr model: An electron orbiting its nucleus would continuously accelerate due to centripetal force provided by electrostatic attraction between proton & electron; hence classically predicted that such orbits must decay over time leading to emission spectrum consisting only one line instead observed many lines corresponding different transitions among various allowed discrete levels within each shell.\n\n2. Solution with QM:\n   - The quantum mechanical explanation resolves this issue through quantization rules which restrict possible energies/electron configurations based on angular momentum conservation principles thus preventing continuous loss of energy via EM waves thereby stabilizing these systems against collapse into lower-energy ground state configuration\n\n3. Excited States Emission Problem:\n   - Once again using Maxwells equation we see if there exists any mechanism allowing transition back towards equilibrium position then indeed they do exist but now governed under new set up called “quantum mechanics” where probabilistic nature comes handy here as opposed deterministic view previously held true!\n\n4. Explanation Using QM:\n   - When an external perturbation causes excitation i.e., raising electron above initial level say n=0 ->n= 5 or vice versa depending upon context then according to Schrodinger wave function solutions associated w/each orbital shape differ significantly implying distinct spatial distribution patterns amongst them all together forming basis vectors spanning entire Hilbert space representing complete system description!\n   - Now when transitioning occurs either spontaneously or stimulated process takes place wherein probability amplitude squared gives us likelihood finding particle somewhere else inside domain defined earlier! Thus providing means for restoring stability while still maintaining consistency across multiple scales involved simultaneously unlike previous attempts relying solely on single variable approach alone..\n\n5. Final Answer Boxed Formatted:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Classical electromagnetism fails because accelerated charge emits radiation causing instability whereas quantum mechanics provides resolution through quantized energy levels}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Excited states require additional mechanisms like spontaneous/stimulated processes explained well enough by QM framework }}\n\\]"}

Step 2: Inelastic Scattering Cross Section ($S_{inel}$)\nIn case when one or more particles change their states during collision process i.e., they get polarised then corresponding term will appear in expression above giving rise additional factor like $(g_s g_t)$ etc..\n\nThus including these factors gives us modified form of equation involving various coupling constants depending upon nature of
