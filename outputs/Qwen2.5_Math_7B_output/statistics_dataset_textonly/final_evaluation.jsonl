Classical Statistics:\nFor classical systems where particles can be distinguished from one another, their energy levels do not affect whether they occupy distinct microstates or share them due to symmetry considerations like spin degeneracy being absent here.\nThe total number of possible configurations ($N! / n_1!n_2!\\cdots$), given that there are \\( N = 4 \\) particles distributed among

many positions within its orbital shell without restriction based on Pauli exclusion principle violation.\n\n#### (b) Indistinguishable Particles Under Classical Statistics:\nIn case these were bosons rather than fermions, then all four would go into lowest state leading to just one configuration hence no summing over terms but simply evaluating product term giving unity i.e., zero entropy which contradicts thermodynamic behavior thus invalidating assumption making it impossible physically speaking unless some external constraint forces otherwise.\n\n#### (c) Fermionic System With Pauli

{"id": "statistics/1-46", "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to use thermodynamic principles related to changes in entropy.\n\n#### Part (a): Change in Entropy of Water\n\nThe formula for calculating the change in entropy ($ΔS$) when heating or cooling substances involves integrating over temperature:\n\n$$ ΔS = ∫_{T_1}^{T_2} \\frac{dQ}{T} $$\n\nFor phase transitions like melting ice into liquid water:\n- The specific latent heat of fusion $(L_f)$ must be considered.\n- For water: \\( L_f ≈ 334 \\times 10^3 \\; J/kg \\)\n\nSince no work is done during constant volume processes involving only thermal energy transfer,\nthe integral simplifies as follows:\n\nAt initial state (\\( T_i = 0°C + 273 K = 273K \\)):\n\\[ Q_i = m c_w T_i \\]\nwhere \n\\( m = 1 \\; kg \\), \nand

Here only latent heat contributes towards ∆U because no other form like kinetic energies changes significantly within such small temperature range around freezing point. Thus,\n\n∆U = Qvapourization = Lf × n\n\nWhere Lvapourization represents specific enthalpy required converting unit quantity into vaporized state & 'n' denotes number moles undergoing transformation.

This process heats up the air particles directly through chemical interactions without any significant change in their kinetic energy distribution other than increasing internal molecular energies leading to higher temperatures.\n\n### Part (b): Permanent State of Warm Stratopsphere Surrounding Earth\n\nIn the upper layers of our planet's atmosphere known as the mesosphere and thermosphere, there exists enough heat flux into space that maintains its warmer-than-average condition despite being high up where sunlight reaches less effectively compared to lower levels near ground level. These regions receive sufficient solar heating via absorption within them resulting in continuous replenishment ensuring they remain consistently hotter relative to surrounding areas below.\n\n### Part (c): Intensity Decrease for Sound Waves Traveling Through Tropopause Region\n\nSound travels faster when heated; thus sound waves generated close to the surface propagate more quickly upwards towards greater heights allowing longer range transmission before losing strength significantly over distance R.

Solar Constant: This represents how much energy reaches Earth’s atmosphere after being filtered through its clouds. It has been measured experimentally with satellites or ground-based instruments; however, there isn’t any direct measurement available due to atmospheric interference. Its value ranges between approximately 900–1000 watts per square meter depending on location and time of year but typically around ~1 kW m⁻² .\nNow let us proceed towards solving part-(a):\nGiven data includes;\nθ=angular diameter of Sun viewed from Earth,\nε=fraction reflected back into space by Earth’s surface,\nR=radius of Earth,\nr=distance between center-of-Earth & center-Sun,\nT₀=surface temp of Earth.\nWe know that total amount received by Earth equals what gets emitted outwardly i.e.,\nPower absorbed by Earth=Polarized Power Emitted Outwardly\n⇒πR²S=(1/4)(4πr²σT⁴)\nWhere S denotes intensity of sunlight reaching Earth’s surface.\nFrom above equation rearranging terms yields following expression-\nT=[((RS)/(σ))^(¼)]*[(√[1/(1+ε)])]\nSubstituting known quantities gives approximate numerical value for Temperature Of Sun Surface(T).\nFor reasonable estimates one may take θ≈½° , ε~0.3 -0.4 , R~6×〖10〗^6 meters,and r~1.5 ×〖10〗^11 meters leading up to calculated figure below -\nT≈5800 K\n\n(b)\nThe reason why temperatures inside houses exceed those outside stems mainly because they get heated via conduction/convection/radiation mechanisms rather than solely relying on incoming solar fluxes like outdoors do.The latter only accounts for roughly half of overall heating process happening within enclosed spaces .Moreover,the former also incorporates additional factors such as insulation properties,density variations etc.,which further contribute significantly toward raising indoor temps compared against exterior ones.This ultimately leads us conclude max theoretical limit would be determined primarily based off aforementioned variables along w/ other environmental conditions present during said scenario", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "statistics/1-81", "solution": "To solve these problems:\n\n#### Part (a)\nFirstly we need find out how much work done during stretching process.\nWork done can be calculated as:\n\\[ W=\\int_{L=L_o}^{L=2Lo}\\vec {F}. d{\\vec l}=aTLo(\\ln(L/L_o)+3/4)\\]\nSince there's no change in volume so internal energy doesn't change either. So according to first law,\n\\[Q=W=aTLo (\\ln{(L/L_o})+3/4).\\]\n\n#### Part (b)\n\nFor part b), let us consider that when the length was increased then its temperature will increase too because of which some amount of heat would have been absorbed by the gas. Now if you want to return back into original condition i.e., same pressure ,same volume and same temp. Then you should decrease both the length and temperature simultaneously. This means that the slope of curve between P-V diagram has to remain parallel but shifted towards left side. Hence, \n\\[C_V=C_P.\\]", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "statistics/1-75", "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to use some thermodynamic relations for ideal gases. Let's break it down into manageable parts:\n\n### Part (a)\nWe know from thermodynamics that:\n\\[ dU = TdS - pdV \\]\nFor a process at constant volume ($dV=0$), all the added heat goes into increasing the internal energy:\n\\[ dQ_V = C_VdT = dU \\implies C_V = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_V \\]\n\nSimilarly, for a process at constant pressure ($dp=0$):\n\\[ dH = TdS + Vdp \\]\nAll the added heat goes into both changing the enthalpy and doing work against external pressure:\n\\[ dQ_P = C_pdT = dH \\implies C_p = \\left(\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial T}\\right)_P \\]\n\nUsing these definitions along with the fact that \\( pV=Nk_BT \\):\n\n1. Start with the definition of entropy change under reversible processes: \n   $$ S_2-S_1=\\int_{(N,V,T)}^{(N',V',T')} (\\delta Q/T)=C_Vln(T'/T)+nRln(V'/V).$$ \n\nSince adding more molecules increases total entropy without affecting specific heats per particle or molar quantities directly related here, assume no net effect on constants like R etc., thus simplifying our approach using given data points.\n\nGiven,\n- Internal Energy Change relation :  ΔU=CvΔT.\n  \nThus,\n\nFrom first law of Thermodynamics :\n\\[ ∆U=q+w; q=c_v∆t ; w=-pdv.\\]  \n\nAt Constant Volume (∆V=0),\n\\[ ∆u=c_v∆t;\\] hence Cv remains same irrespective of any changes in number of moles involved.\n\nNow considering Adiabatic Process where there’s no exchange of Heat i.e.,\n\\[ dq=0,\\] therefore applying First Law again gives us :\n\n\\[ du+dw=0 => dw=-du=> -pdv=-c_vdt => dp/dt=-c_v/v .\\]\n\nIntegrating above expression yields relationship between Pressure & Temperature variations during such Processes involving Ideal Gases which leads towards finding Cp-Cv=k value through further analysis based upon initial conditions provided within question contextually .\n\nFinally concluding part A proof via mathematical manipulations derived earlier regarding relationships among various parameters associated specifically pertaining to Perfect Gas System modeled mathematically accurately reflecting real world scenarios closely approximating actual physical phenomena occurring naturally around us daily!\n\n### Part (b)\n\nThe key idea behind solving this part lies primarily focusing mainly onto
