This means the unperturbed Hamiltonian describes a hydrogen-like atom. A perturbation due to the surrounding environment introduces a new potential term, causing the degenerate *l* = 1 level to split into three sublevels. Our goal is to find these new energies and their corresponding wavefunctions.\n\n* **Perturbation Theory:** Since the perturbation is small compared to the original Hamiltonian, we use time-independent perturbation theory. To first order, the energy shift for a given state |ψ⟩ is:\n\n   ΔE<sub>n</sub> = ⟨ψ<sub>n</sub>| V<sub>pert</sub> | ψ<sub>n</sub>⟩\n\n* **Choosing Basis States:** Because the perturbation breaks spherical symmetry, we cannot directly apply the usual degeneracy lifting argument based on parity.

{"id": "atomic/2-35", "solution": "## Answering Advanced Physics Questions about Nuclear Structure:\n\n\n**(a) Alpha Decay vs Neutron Emission:**\n\nHeavy nuclei are more prone to alpha decay than neutron emission due to the interplay between strong nuclear force and Coulomb repulsion. Here's a breakdown:\n\n**Step 1: Strong Force & Binding Energy:**\n\n*  The strong nuclear force binds protons and neutrons together within the nucleus. This binding energy per nucleon peaks around iron (Fe). Heavier nuclei have lower binding energy per nucleon.\n\n**Step 2: Coulomb Repulsion:**\n\n* Heavy nuclei contain many protons, leading to significant electrostatic repulsion. As the number of protons increases, this repulsive force becomes increasingly dominant.\n\n**Step 3: Energetics of Decay:**\n\n* **Alpha Decay:** Emitting an alpha particle (two protons and two neutrons) reduces both the proton number and the overall mass significantly. This leads to a substantial decrease in Coulomb repulsion and often results in a net release of energy, making it energetically favorable.\n* **Neutron Emission:** While emitting a neutron would reduce some nuclear potential energy, the gain wouldn't be as large as with alpha decay because only one nucleon is removed. Additionally, there's no reduction in Coulomb repulsion. Therefore, neutron emission is usually not energetically favored in heavy nuclei unless they are extremely neutron-rich.\n\n**Conclusion:** For very heavy nuclei, the combined effect of high Coulomb repulsion and relatively low binding energy per nucleon makes alpha decay the preferred mode of radioactive decay compared to neutron emission.\n\n\n\n**(b) Determining Nuclear Radii:**\n\nSeveral experimental techniques are employed to measure nuclear radii:\n\n**1. Electron Scattering:**\n\n* High-energy electrons are scattered off target nuclei. Analyzing the scattering pattern reveals information about the spatial distribution of charge within the nucleus, allowing us to infer the radius.\n\n**2. Muonic Atom Spectroscopy:**\n\n* A muon (similar to an electron but heavier) can replace an electron in an atom, forming a muonic atom. Due to the muon's larger mass, its orbit is closer to the nucleus. Measuring the energy levels of muonic atoms provides precise measurements of nuclear size.\n\n**3. Proton Scattering:**\n\n* Similar to electron scattering, but using protons instead. However, the interaction involves the strong nuclear force, requiring careful analysis to extract information about the nuclear radius.\n\n**Arguments Used:**\n\nThese experiments rely on analyzing the angular distribution and energy loss of the scattered particles or emitted radiation. By fitting theoretical models based on different nuclear shapes and sizes to the experimental data, we can deduce the most likely value for the nuclear radius.\n\n**(c) Properties of Lowest Energy State Nuclei:**\n\nA system of nucleons in its lowest energy state exhibits several key characteristics:\n\n**Classical Properties:**\n\n* **Minimum Potential Energy:** Nucleons occupy positions that minimize their total potential energy arising from the strong nuclear force and Coulomb repulsion.\n* **Spherical Symmetry:** Most stable nuclei tend towards spherical symmetry due to the isotropic nature of the strong force.\n\n**Nonclassical Properties:**\n\n* **Shell Model:** Nucleons fill discrete energy levels similar to electrons in atomic shells. Filled shells contribute to stability.\n* **Magic Numbers:** Certain numbers of protons or neutrons (e.g., 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82) result in particularly stable configurations known as \"magic numbers.\" These correspond to filled shells.\n* **Nuclear Spin and Parity:** The total spin and parity of the nucleus depend on the arrangement of nucleons in specific quantum states.\n\n**(d) Uranium Fission Cross Sections:**\n\nThe observed trends in fission cross sections for uranium isotopes arise from the complex interplay of nuclear structure and neutron interactions:\n\n**Thermal Neutrons:**\n\n* **Even-Odd Periodicity:** The higher cross sections for odd-mass isotopes like $^{231}U$, $^{233}U$, and $^{235}U$ reflect the fact that adding a neutron to an even-even nucleus creates a more easily fissile configuration. Odd-mass nuclei already possess unpaired nucleons which facilitate neutron capture and subsequent fission.\n* **Zero Cross Section for Even-Even Isotopes:** Even-even isotopes like $^{234}U$ and $^{236}U$ are generally less susceptible to thermal neutron induced fission because capturing a neutron disrupts the paired nucleon configuration, requiring additional energy input for fission.\n\n**Fast Neutrons:**\n\n* **Reduced Even-Odd Effect:** At higher energies, the incoming neutron has enough kinetic energy to overcome pairing effects and induce fission in both even-even and odd-mass isotopes. Hence, the even-odd periodicity is less pronounced.\n\n\\[\\boxed{ } \\]", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

To find the force exerted by the electron on the wall, we can consider the change in momentum of the electron when it collides with the wall.

Therefore, the change in momentum Δp is twice the initial momentum p.\n\n* **Force:** Force is related to the rate of change of momentum: F = Δp/Δt.

It acts over very short distances and overcomes the electrostatic repulsion between protons. We assume this force is identical for any pair of nucleons (proton-proton, proton-neutron, neutron-neutron). \n* **Electrostatic Repulsion:** Protons carry positive charge and repel each other according to Coulomb's law.

Instead, the excess energy is transferred to another electron within the same atom, causing that electron to be ejected (emitted). This emitted electron is called an \"Auger electron.\" \n\n* **Step-by-step:**\n    1. An inner shell electron is removed from the atom (e.g., through ionization by X-rays or other radiation).\n    2. A higher-energy electron fills the vacancy created in the inner shell.\n    3. The energy released during this transition is not emitted as a photon but instead transfers to another outer-shell electron.\n    4. This energized outer-shell electron escapes the atom as an Auger electron.\n\n**(b) Anomalous Zeeman Effect**\n\n* **Description:** The anomalous Zeeman effect refers to the splitting of spectral lines into more than just two components when placed in a magnetic field. This deviation from the expected simple doublet splitting observed in the normal Zeeman effect arises due to the interaction between the orbital angular momentum and spin angular momentum of electrons within the atom.\n\n* **Key Points:**\n   * Normal Zeeman effect assumes only orbital angular momentum contributes to magnetic moment.\n   * Anomalous Zeeman effect considers both orbital and spin angular momenta, leading to complex splittings depending on the total angular momentum (J) of the atom.\n\n**(c) Lamb Shift**\n\n* **Description:** The Lamb shift is a tiny difference in energy levels of hydrogen-like atoms (atoms with one electron) predicted by quantum electrodynamics (QED), which cannot be explained by classical physics or non-relativistic quantum mechanics alone. It arises from interactions between the electron and virtual photons.\n\n* **Explanation:** Virtual particles constantly pop in and out of existence even in a vacuum. These virtual photons interact with the electron, slightly altering its energy levels.\n\n**(d) Landé Interval Rule**\n\n* **Rule:** The Landé interval rule predicts the spacing between adjacent spectral lines arising from transitions involving fine structure splitting.\n\n* **Formula:** The magnitude of the splitting ΔE is given by:\n   ΔE = g μ<sub>B</sub> B J\n\nwhere:\n    * ΔE is the energy difference between the split levels\n    * g is the Lande g-factor (depends on the specific electronic configuration)\n    * μ<sub>B</sub> is the Bohr magneton\n    * B is the strength of the applied magnetic field\n    * J is the total angular momentum quantum number\n\n**(e) Hund's Rules for Atomic Levels**\n\n* **Rules:** Hund's rules are empirical guidelines used to determine the ground state term symbol (which describes the overall angular momentum and multiplicity of an atom) based on its electron configuration.\n\n* **The Three Rules:**\n    1. **Maximize Spin Multiplicity:** Electrons occupy orbitals individually before doubling up, maximizing the total spin S.\n    2. **Maximize Orbital Angular Momentum L:** For a given spin multiplicity, maximize the total orbital angular momentum L.\n    3. **Minimize J:** If the subshell is less than half full, minimize the total angular momentum J (L + S); if it is more than half full, maximize J.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you would like further elaboration on any of these topics!\n", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

These patterns have a minimum size determined by the limitations of printing technology and human readability. Shrinking these patterns to fit on a postcard doesn't change the fundamental amount of information they contain. It just makes them incredibly tiny.\n\n* **Resolution Limits:** Electron microscopes can resolve objects down to the atomic scale (around 0.1 nanometers).

This diffraction effect limits how sharply focused an image can be, especially at extremely high magnifications.\n\n* **Wave-Particle Duality:** Electrons behave as both particles and waves.

The centrifugal potential energy associated with orbital angular momentum is L²(ħ²/(2mr²)).\n\n* **Step 4: Total energy requirement.** The total energy needed for capture is approximately:\n\n    E ≥ V₀ + L²(ħ²/(2mr²))\n\n    For l = 1, we get:\n\n    E ≥ 2.88 MeV + (1²)(ħ²/(2mr²))\n\n* **Step 5: Approximate the right side.** To estimate the second term, use ħ ≈ 1.05 x 10⁻²⁵ erg⋅s, m ≈ m<sub>n</sub> ≈ 1.67 x 10⁻²⁴ g, and convert units appropriately.

Here are some key ones relevant to this scenario:\n\n* **Doppler Broadening:**  Atoms or ions moving towards or away from the observer will emit light with slightly different frequencies due to the Doppler effect. In a hot gas, the distribution of velocities causes a spread in emitted wavelengths. This is often the dominant broadening mechanism at higher temperatures.\n\n* **Pressure/Collisional Broadening:** Collisions between atoms or ions interrupt the radiative process, leading to uncertainty in the energy levels and thus the emitted frequency.

This process leads to a significant reduction in the electrostatic repulsion between protons within the nucleus.  The resulting daughter nucleus has a higher binding energy per nucleon than the parent nucleus. This difference in binding energy translates into a substantial release of energy, making alpha decay energetically favorable.\n\n* **Other Modes:** Other decay modes like proton, deuteron, or triton emission would result in smaller changes in the nuclear structure and consequently less reduction in Coulomb repulsion. Fission, while releasing even more energy, requires overcoming a much larger Coulomb barrier due to the splitting of a very large nucleus.\n\n**(b) Coulomb Barrier**\n\n* **Coulomb Barrier:** The positively charged alpha particle experiences a strong repulsive force from the positive charge of the remaining nucleus as it attempts to escape.

While heavier particles face a greater Coulomb barrier, the alpha particle's size allows for a non-negligible probability of quantum mechanical tunneling.

{"id": "atomic/2-34", "solution": "Here's a breakdown of why alpha decay is more common than proton radioactivity:\n\n**1. Coulombic Repulsion:**\n\n* **Alpha particles (α):** Consist of two protons and two neutrons, carrying a +2 charge. This positive charge experiences strong electrostatic repulsion from the positively charged nucleus it originates from. \n* **Protons:** Carry only a single unit of positive charge (+1). The repulsive force they experience from the nucleus is weaker compared to that experienced by an alpha particle.\n\n**2. Strong Nuclear Force:**\n\n* Both alpha particles and individual protons are held within the nucleus by the strong nuclear force. However, the strong force has a very short range.  \n* An alpha particle, being larger, allows for multiple nucleons to simultaneously interact via the strong force, leading to a stronger binding energy *within* the alpha particle itself. This makes it easier for the entire alpha particle to overcome the Coulomb barrier and escape the nucleus.\n\n**3. Energy Considerations:**\n\nFor radioactive decay to occur, the daughter nucleus must have lower energy than the parent nucleus. Let's consider the Q-value, which represents the energy released during the decay process:\n\n* **Q-value for α-decay:**\n\n   The Q-value for alpha decay is generally large and positive due to the high binding energy per nucleon in alpha particles. This means there's enough energy available to overcome the Coulomb barrier.\n\n* **Q-value for proton decay:**\n\n   The Q-value for proton decay is typically much smaller and often negative. This indicates that emitting a proton would require inputting energy rather than releasing it, making it energetically unfavorable.\n\n**4. Tunneling Effect:**\n\nEven if the Q-value is favorable, both alpha particles and protons need to tunnel through the Coulomb barrier to escape the nucleus. Due to their higher mass and charge, alpha particles face a thicker potential barrier. However, because of their greater binding energy, they still have a reasonable probability of tunneling out. Protons, facing a thinner barrier but lacking the same internal binding energy advantage, have a significantly lower tunneling probability.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of stronger Coulomb repulsion, weaker binding within the nucleus, and less favorable energy considerations make proton radioactivity extremely rare compared to alpha decay.\n\n\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Alpha decay is favored over proton radioactivity due to stronger Coulomb repulsion, higher binding energy within the alpha particle, and more favorable energy release.}} \\]\n", "final_answers": ["\\text{Alpha decay is favored over proton radioactivity due to stronger Coulomb repulsion, higher binding energy within the alpha particle, and more favorable energy release.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Alpha decay is favored over proton radioactivity due to stronger Coulomb repulsion, higher binding energy within the alpha particle, and more favorable energy release.}", "expr2": "E_d > 0 \\text{ for } \\alpha\\text{-decay (for } A \\geq 150\\text{); } -\\varepsilon < 0 \\text{ for proton-decay}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "atomic/1-7", "solution": "Here's a breakdown of the answers:\n\n\n**(a) Explanation for Changes in Ionization Energy**\n\nIonization energy ($E_I$) represents the energy needed to remove an electron from an atom. Here's why it changes across these elements:\n\n* **Hydrogen (H):** Has only one proton and one electron. This single electron experiences a strong electrostatic attraction to the nucleus due to the lack of shielding from other electrons. Hence, removing this electron requires significant energy (13.6 eV).\n\n* **Helium (He):** Has two protons and two electrons. Both electrons experience a stronger pull towards the nucleus compared to hydrogen because there are more positive charges attracting them. Additionally, the electrons repel each other slightly, making it harder to remove one. Therefore, helium has a higher ionization energy than hydrogen (24.6 eV).\n\n* **Lithium (Li):** Has three protons and three electrons. While lithium also has a stronger nuclear charge than helium, its third electron occupies a higher energy level (the 2s orbital) further away from the nucleus. This increased distance weakens the attractive force between the nucleus and the outermost electron. Consequently, lithium has a lower ionization energy than helium (5.4 eV).\n\n**(b) Second Ionization Energy of Helium**\n\nThe second ionization energy of helium refers to removing the *second* electron after the first one is already gone. Now, helium effectively becomes a singly ionized helium ion (He+).\n\n* He+ has only one remaining electron experiencing the full attractive force of the two protons without any repulsion from another electron. This makes the second electron much more tightly bound.\n\nTherefore, the second ionization energy of helium will be significantly higher than the first ionization energy. A typical value for the second ionization energy of helium is around **54.4 eV**.\n\n**(c) Dependence of Energy Levels on Quantum Number 'l'**\n\nIn atoms with multiple electrons, the energy levels are not solely determined by the principal quantum number (*n*) but also by the angular momentum quantum number (*l*). This dependence arises due to several factors:\n\n* **Electron-electron interactions:** Electrons within an atom interact with each other through Coulombic forces. These interactions vary depending on their spatial distribution, which is influenced by the shape of the orbitals defined by *l*.\n\n* **Shielding effect:** Inner shell electrons shield outer electrons from the full attractive force of the nucleus. The degree of shielding depends on the penetration ability of different orbitals. Orbitals with smaller *l* values penetrate closer to the nucleus and experience less shielding.\n\n* **Nuclear Charge Distribution:** Although often treated as point charges, nuclei have finite size distributions. Different *l* orbitals can sample different regions of this distribution, leading to slight variations in effective nuclear charge experienced by electrons.\n\n\n\nAs a result of these effects, orbitals with the same *n* but different *l* values have distinct energies. In Figure 1.1, we see that the 3s orbital (l=0) has the lowest energy, followed by 3p (l=1), and then 3d (l=2). This trend reflects the increasing penetration and decreasing shielding effectiveness as *l* increases.", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

Compton Formula:**\n\nThe key equation for Compton scattering is:\n\n Δλ = λ' - λ = (h/(m_e * c)) * (1 - cos(θ))\n\nwhere:\n\n* Δλ is the change in wavelength\n* λ' is the wavelength of the scattered photon\n* λ is the wavelength of the incident photon\n* h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J s)\n* m_e is the mass of the electron (9.109 x 10^-31 kg)\n* c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s)\n* θ is the scattering angle\n\n **3. Relate Wavelength and Frequency:**\n\nWe know the initial frequency of the X-ray photon. We can use the relationship between frequency (f), wavelength (λ), and the speed of light (c):\n\nc = fλ\n\nTherefore:\n\nλ = c / f\n\n**4. Calculate Initial Wavelength:**\n\nSubstitute the given values into the equation above to find the initial wavelength:\n\nλ = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (3 x 10^19 Hz) = 1 x 10^-11 m\n\n**5. Apply Compton Formula:**\n\nNow we have all the information needed to calculate the change in wavelength:\n\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 J s / (9.109 x 10^-31 kg * 3 x 10^8 m/s)) * (1 - cos(90°))\n\nSince cos(90°) = 0, the equation simplifies to:\n\nΔλ = (6.626 x 10^-34 J s / (9.109 x 10^-31 kg * 3 x 10^8 m/s))\n\nCalculate Δλ. This will be the difference between the initial and final wavelengths.\n\n**6.

Understand Threshold Energy**\n\nThreshold energy is the minimum kinetic energy a projectile particle needs to initiate a specific nuclear reaction.  At threshold, all products of the reaction are produced with minimal kinetic energy.\n\n**2. Conservation Laws**\n\nWe need to apply conservation laws to determine the threshold energy:\n\n* **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after the collision.\n* **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n\n**3. Setting up the Problem**\n\nLet:\n\n* $m_p$ be the mass of a proton \n* $m_{\\pi}$ be the mass of a pion ($\\pi^0$)\n* $K_{in}$ be the initial kinetic energy of the incoming proton\n* $c$ be the speed of light\n\nInitially, we have one proton moving with kinetic energy $K_{in}$. After the collision, we have three particles: two protons and a pion. Since it's a threshold case, they will have minimal kinetic energies.\n\n**4. Applying Conservation of Momentum**\n\nSince the target proton is initially at rest, the total initial momentum is simply the momentum of the incident proton:\n\n $$p_{initial} = \\sqrt{2m_p K_{in}}$$\n\nAfter the collision, let the momenta of the outgoing protons be $\\vec{p}_1$ and $\\vec{p}_2$, and the momentum of the pion be $\\vec{p}_{\\pi}$. We can write the conservation of momentum as:\n\n$$\\vec{p}_{initial} = \\vec{p}_1 + \\vec{p}_2 + \\vec{p}_{\\pi}$$\n\nFor simplicity, assume the reaction occurs along a straight line. This means all momenta are either positive or negative along that axis.\n\n**5. Applying Conservation of Energy**\n\n\nThe total relativistic energy before the collision is:\n\n$$E_{initial} = m_pc^2 + K_{in}$$\n\nThe total relativistic energy after the collision is:\n\n$$ E_{final} = \\sqrt{(m_pc^2)^2 + (\\vec{p}_1 c)^2 } + \\sqrt{(m_pc^2)^2 + (\\vec{p}_2 c)^2 } + \\sqrt{(m_{\\pi}c^2)^2 + (\\vec{p}_{\\pi} c)^2 }$$\n\nApplying conservation of energy:\n\n$$E_{initial} = E_{final}$$\n\n**6. Solving for Threshold Kinetic Energy**\n\nTo find the threshold energy ($K_{in}$), follow these steps:\n\n* At threshold, the outgoing protons have very small kinetic energies compared to their rest masses. Therefore, you can approximate their relativistic energies as approximately equal to their rest masses:\n\n   $$\\sqrt{(m_pc^2)^2 + (\\vec{p}_1 c)^2 } \\approx m_pc^2$$\n   $$\\sqrt{(m_pc^2)^2 + (\\vec{p}_2 c)^2 } \\approx m_pc^2$$\n\n* Substitute these approximations into the conservation of energy equation.\n* Use the conservation of momentum equation to express the magnitudes of the momenta in terms of each other.\n* Solve the resulting equations simultaneously for $K_{in}$.\n\n\n\nThis process involves some algebraic manipulation but ultimately leads to an expression for the threshold kinetic energy.\n\n**7.

{"id": "atomic/3-32", "solution": "Here's a breakdown of how we can determine the properties of the η⁰ particle based on the given information:\n\n\n**(a) Production via s-wave:**\n\n* **Experiment:**  The statement that the η⁰ is produced by *s*-waves in the reaction π⁻ + p → η⁰ + n implies this interaction was studied using scattering experiments.\n\n* **Explanation:** Particle physicists use accelerators to collide beams of particles like protons (p) and negatively charged pions (π⁻). Detectors surrounding the collision point measure the outgoing particles. By analyzing the angular distribution of the emitted neutrons (n) and η⁰ particles, they can deduce the orbital angular momentum involved in the reaction. An *s*-wave corresponds to zero orbital angular momentum.\n\n**Why no π⁻ + p → η⁻ + p?**\n\nThe absence of the reaction π⁻ + p → η⁻ + p suggests that the η⁰ has different quantum numbers than the η⁻. This difference likely arises from their strangeness quantum number (discussed later).\n\n**(b) Decay Modes and Probabilities:**\n\n* **Experiment:** These decay modes were determined through careful observation of the products resulting from η⁰ decays.\n\n* **Explanation:** After producing η⁰ particles, detectors would identify the daughter particles (photons γ or pions π) and measure their energies and momenta. Analyzing the frequency of each decay mode allows for the determination of branching ratios (probabilities).\n\n**(c) Rest Mass:**\n\n* **Experiment:** The rest mass of the η⁰ was measured directly using techniques like time-of-flight measurements or invariant mass reconstruction.\n\n* **Explanation:**\n\n    * **Time-of-Flight:** Measure the time it takes for the η⁰ to travel a known distance after production. Knowing its velocity (from momentum measurement), one can calculate its kinetic energy and then its mass using relativistic kinematics.\n    * **Invariant Mass Reconstruction:** Analyze the four-momenta (energy and momentum) of the decay products. Using conservation laws, the invariant mass of the original η⁰ can be reconstructed.\n\n**Inferring Spin, Isospin, and Charge:**\n\n* **Spin:** Since the η⁰ is produced in an *s*-wave reaction, its spin must be 0. Only particles with integer spins (bosons) can be produced in *s*-wave states due to the rules of angular momentum addition.\n\n* **Isospin:** The fact that the η⁰ doesn't appear in reactions involving only nucleons (protons and neutrons) but does involve pions suggests it carries non-zero isospin. Pions form an isotriplet (I = 1), while nucleons form an isodoublet (I = 1/2). To conserve isospin in strong interactions, the η⁰ must also carry some isospin value. Further analysis of its decay modes into pions helps pinpoint its specific isospin value.\n\n* **Charge:** The symbol \"η⁰\" indicates a neutral particle.

In the frame where the total momentum is zero, we have:\n\n   ```\n   p₁ + p₂ = 0\n   ```\n\n* **Step 3: Substitute the momenta and solve for the relative velocity.**\n\n   Substituting the expressions for the momenta from Step 1 into the equation above gives us:\n\n   ```\n   ε/c + E/c = 0\n   ```\n\n   Solving for E, we get:\n\n   ```\n   E = -ε\n   ```\n\n   This result implies that the energies of the photons need to be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign for their momenta to cancel out. However, since energy is always positive, this scenario isn't physically possible. This means there's no inertial frame where the total momentum of these two photons is exactly zero.\n\n* **Step 4: Consider a Lorentz transformation.**\n\n    To find the frame where the total momentum is minimized, we can use a Lorentz transformation. Let β be the velocity of this new frame relative to the original frame. The transformed momentum in the new frame (denoted by primes) is related to the original momentum by:\n\n    ```\n    p' = γ(p - βE/c)\n    ```\n\n    Where γ is the Lorentz factor:\n\n    ```\n    γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²)\n    ```\n\n* **Step 5: Minimize the total momentum in the new frame.**\n\n    We want to find the value of β that minimizes the sum of the transformed momenta:\n\n    ```\n    p'_1 + p'_2 = 0\n    ```\n\n    Substitute the expressions for the transformed momenta and simplify.

In 1962, Leon Lederman, Melvin Schwartz, and Jack Steinberger conducted a groundbreaking experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory. They observed muons decaying into positrons, electrons-neutrinos, and another particle they called the \"muon neutrino\" (ν<sub>μ</sub>). This was distinct from the electron neutrino (ν<sub>e</sub>), previously known from beta decay studies. Their experiment showed that the new neutrino interacted differently than the electron neutrino, proving the existence of at least two types.\n\n* **Key Experiment Details:** A beam of pions was created and allowed to decay into muons and muon neutrinos. These neutrinos were then directed towards a target made of aluminum plates surrounded by scintillation counters. Only interactions consistent with ν<sub>μ</sub> producing muons were detected, confirming their unique identity.\n\n**(2) Small Interaction Cross Section:**\n\n* **Early Reactor Experiments:** Early experiments using nuclear reactors as neutrino sources demonstrated the incredibly weak interaction of neutrinos. Reactors emit large numbers of electron antineutrinos (ν̅<sub>e</sub>). Detectors placed near reactors could only detect a tiny fraction of these neutrinos interacting with matter.\n\n* **Example: Cowan-Reines Experiment (1956):** Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan used a detector filled with water containing cadmium chloride near a nuclear reactor. When a ν̅<sub>e</sub> interacts with a proton in the water, it can produce a positron and a neutron. The positron annihilates, emitting gamma rays detectable by scintillators, while the neutron captures on cadmium, releasing more gamma rays. The coincidence of these signals provided strong evidence for neutrino detection and highlighted their extremely low probability of interaction.\n\n**(b) Pion Production Reactions**\n\nHere are the reactions where an energetic neutrino produces a single pion:\n\n**(1) With a Proton:**\n\n   ν<sub>μ</sub> + p → μ<sup>−</sup> + π<sup>+</sup> + p\n\n**(2) With a Neutron:**\n\n   ν<sub>μ</sub> + n → μ<sup>−</sup> + π<sup>0</sup> + n\n\nIn both cases, a charged current weak interaction occurs, transforming the neutrino into its corresponding lepton (muon) and creating a pion along with other particles.\n\n**(c) Helicity**\n\nHelicity refers to the projection of a particle's spin angular momentum onto its direction of motion. It essentially describes whether a particle spins \"with\" or \"against\" its movement.\n\n* For massless particles like neutrinos, helicity is equivalent to chirality.\n\n* **Neutrinos have left-handed helicity**, meaning their spin points opposite to their momentum vector.\n\n* **Antineutrinos have right-handed helicity**.\n\n\n\n**(d) Muon Decay Modes**\n\n**(1) μ<sup>+</sup> → e<sup>+</sup> + γ : Forbidden**\n\nThis decay mode violates conservation laws. Specifically, it violates **lepton number conservation**. Lepton number must be conserved in all fundamental interactions. The initial state has a lepton number of +1 (from the muon), while the final state has a lepton number of 0 (+1 for the positron and -1 for the photon).\n\n**(2) μ<sup>+</sup> → e<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>−</sup> + e<sup>+</sup> : Forbidden**\n\nThis decay also violates **lepton number conservation**. The initial state has a lepton number of +1, but the final state has a total lepton number of +1 (-1 for each electron and +3 for the positron).\n\nTherefore, neither of these decay modes can occur naturally because they violate fundamental conservation laws.\n\n\n\nI hope this detailed explanation helps!

Their mass is so small that it was long thought they were massless. We know neutrinos have mass because they oscillate between different flavors (electron, muon, tau). This oscillation phenomenon requires non-zero masses.\n\n**Analyzing the Options:**\n\n* **(a) Angular Distribution in Electron-Neutrino Scattering:** While scattering experiments can reveal information about particle interactions, they are not particularly sensitive to the tiny mass of the electron neutrino. The scattering angle primarily depends on the momentum transfer, which is less affected by such a small mass difference.\n\n* **(b) Electron Energy Spectrum in Beta-Decay:** This is the most sensitive method. In beta decay, a neutron decays into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. \n\n    The energy released in this process is shared among these particles. If the neutrino had zero mass, the electrons would always be emitted with a specific maximum energy. However, due to the neutrino's non-zero mass, some energy is carried away by the neutrino, resulting in a slight reduction in the maximum electron energy. By carefully analyzing the shape of the electron energy spectrum near its endpoint, physicists can infer the mass of the electron neutrino.\n\n* **(c) Neutrino Flux from the Sun:** Measuring the total number of neutrinos coming from the sun provides valuable information about solar processes but doesn't directly tell us the mass of individual neutrinos.\n\n\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{(b)}}\\]\n", "final_answers": ["\\text{(b)}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{(b)}", "expr2": "(b)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Since the O<sup>16</sup> nucleus is much heavier than the α-particle, its recoil can often be neglected for simplicity.\n\n2. **Scattering Angle:** A 180° scatter means the α-particle reverses direction completely.\n\n3. **Final Kinetic Energy:** Due to conservation of energy, the total kinetic energy remains constant. However, some of the α-particle's kinetic energy is transferred to the O<sup>16</sup> nucleus during the collision.  Let the final kinetic energy of the α-particle be *K<sub>f</sub>*.\n\n4. **Calculating Fractional Change:** The fractional change in kinetic energy is given by:\n\n   (ΔK)/K<sub>i</sub> = (K<sub>f</sub> - K<sub>i</sub>)/K<sub>i</sub>\n\n5. **Using Conservation Laws:** To find *K<sub>f</sub>*, we need to use the conservation laws more explicitly. This involves analyzing the collision in the center-of-mass frame and applying equations related to relative velocities and angles. These calculations can get quite involved depending on the level of detail required.\n\n\n**Simplified Approach (Assuming Head-on Collision):**\n\nFor a simplified understanding, let's consider a head-on collision (which isn't exactly 180°, but close enough for approximation). In such a case, the maximum amount of kinetic energy transfer occurs.\n\nIn a head-on collision with equal masses, the objects exchange their velocities. If the α-particle initially had velocity *v<sub>i</sub>*, after the collision, it would have velocity *-v<sub>i</sub>*.

Since protons and neutrons already fill the nuclear volume, there wouldn't be any available states for electrons to occupy without violating this fundamental principle.\n\n* **Step-by-step reasoning:**\n    * Protons and neutrons are both fermions and reside within the nucleus.\n    * They occupy specific energy levels and quantum states dictated by the strong nuclear force.\n    * Electrons are also fermions and require unique quantum states. There simply aren't enough available states within the nucleus to accommodate them.\n\n**3. Electromagnetic Repulsion:**\n\n* **Argument:** Electrons carry negative charge, and protons within the nucleus carry positive charge. Confining negatively charged electrons within the positively charged nucleus would result in immense electrostatic repulsion, making the atom unstable.\n\n* **Step-by-step reasoning:**\n    * Like charges repel each other according to Coulomb's law.\n    * The concentration of positive charge in the nucleus would create a powerful repulsive force on any electrons attempting to enter.\n    * Such repulsion would overcome any attractive forces and prevent stable electron containment within the nucleus.\n\n**4. Nuclear Stability:**\n\n* **Argument:** Experiments show that atomic nuclei are relatively stable structures. If electrons resided within the nucleus, their presence would significantly alter the balance of forces holding the nucleus together, leading to instability and rapid decay.\n\n* **Step-by-step reasoning:**\n    * The stability of nuclei depends on a delicate interplay between the strong nuclear force (attractive) and electromagnetic repulsion (repulsive).\n    * Introducing electrons into the mix would disrupt this balance, likely causing the nucleus to become unstable and undergo radioactive decay.\n\n\n\nTherefore, based on these arguments, it is highly unlikely that electrons exist inside the nucleus.\n\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Electrons do not exist inside the nucleus.}}\\]\n", "final_answers": ["\\text{Electrons do not exist inside the nucleus.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Electrons do not exist inside the nucleus.}", "expr2": "\\text{Nuclei cannot be composed of protons and electrons}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Electrons do not exist inside the nucleus.}", "expr2": "\\text{Electron cannot be bound in the nucleus}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Forbidden Reaction & Lepton Number Conservation:**\n\nThe reaction $\\nu_\\mu + n → e^- + p$ being forbidden tells us something important about lepton number conservation. Let's analyze why it's forbidden:\n\n* **Initial State:** A muon neutrino (νᵤ) has a lepton number of +1, while a neutron (n) has a lepton number of 0. Total initial lepton number = +1.\n* **Final State:** An electron (e⁻) has a lepton number of -1, and a proton (p) has a lepton number of 0. Total final lepton number = -1.\n\nSince the total lepton number isn't conserved between the initial and final states, this reaction violates lepton number conservation. This suggests that we need separate lepton numbers for each generation of leptons.\n\n**4.

This is achieved through the following steps:\n\n1. **Fission:**  Like conventional reactors, a breeder reactor uses fissionable isotopes (like Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239) to initiate a chain reaction. Neutrons released during fission strike other nuclei, causing them to split and release more neutrons, sustaining the reaction.\n\n2. **Neutron Capture:** Some of these neutrons are captured by fertile isotopes present within the reactor core. Fertile isotopes are non-fissile but can absorb neutrons and transform into fissile isotopes. A common example is Uranium-238, which captures a neutron to become Plutonium-239.\n\n3. **Breeding:** The newly formed fissile isotopes (e.g., Plutonium-239) contribute to the ongoing fission process, effectively \"breeding\" new fuel. \n\n**Prerequisite Physical Constant:**\n\nThe key physical constant that makes breeding possible is the **neutron multiplication factor (k)**.

These extreme conditions overcome the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged atomic nuclei, allowing them to get close enough for the strong nuclear force to take over and bind them together. This binding releases tremendous amounts of energy.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* **The Sun:** The primary thermonuclear reaction powering our Sun is the proton-proton chain. It involves a series of steps where hydrogen nuclei (protons) fuse to form helium, releasing energy in the process. A simplified representation is: 4 protons → 1 helium nucleus + 2 positrons + 2 neutrinos + energy\n\n    *  One crucial step within this chain is the fusion of two protons to form deuterium (a heavy isotope of hydrogen): p + p → d + e+ + νe\n\n* **H-Bomb (Hydrogen Bomb):**  This weapon utilizes a fission reaction (splitting of uranium or plutonium atoms) to create the incredibly high temperatures and pressures needed to initiate thermonuclear fusion. Fusion typically involves isotopes of hydrogen like deuterium and tritium fusing to form helium and neutrons, releasing massive amounts of energy: D + T → He + n + energy\n\n* **Controlled Fusion Attempts:** Scientists worldwide strive to achieve sustained, controllable thermonuclear fusion as a potential clean and nearly limitless source of energy. One promising approach is magnetic confinement fusion, using powerful magnets to confine superheated plasma (ionized gas) containing deuterium and tritium. The goal is to achieve ignition, where the heat generated by the fusion reactions sustains the reaction itself.\n\n**Energy Release:**\n\nThe energy released in thermonuclear reactions is immense due to the conversion of a small amount of mass into energy according to Einstein's famous equation E=mc².

A higher binding energy indicates a more stable nucleus.\n* **Binding Energy Per Nucleon:** This is the average binding energy per particle within the nucleus. It provides a better measure of stability as it accounts for the size of the nucleus.\n\n**The Semi-Empirical Mass Formula**\n\nThis formula approximates the binding energy of a nucleus based on several contributing factors:\n\n```\nB(A, Z) = a_1 * A - a_2 * A^(2/3) - a_3 * (Z*(Z-1))/A^(1/3) - a_4 * ((N-Z)^2)/A + δ \n```\n\nWhere:\n\n*  `B(A, Z)` is the binding energy\n* `A` is the mass number (number of nucleons)\n* `Z` is the atomic number (number of protons)\n* `N` is the neutron number (`N=A-Z`)\n* `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, `a_4` are empirical constants determined experimentally\n* `δ` is a pairing term that considers the extra stability from paired nucleons\n\n\nLet's analyze each term and how they contribute to the difference in binding energy between Iron-56 and Uranium-238:\n\n1. **Volume Term (`a_1 * A`):** This term reflects the attractive strong force holding nucleons together. As the volume of the nucleus increases, so does the potential for these interactions, leading to increased binding energy. Both Fe-56 and U-238 have significant contributions from this term due to their large sizes.\n\n2. **Surface Term (`-a_2 * A^(2/3)`):** This term accounts for the reduced attraction experienced by nucleons at the surface of the nucleus compared to those in the interior. Larger nuclei like U-238 have a larger surface area relative to their volume, resulting in a stronger negative contribution from this term compared to Fe-56.\n\n3. **Coulomb Term (`-a_3 * (Z*(Z-1))/A^(1/3)`):** This term represents the electrostatic repulsion between protons. Since U-238 has significantly more protons than Fe-56, this repulsive force is considerably stronger, reducing its overall binding energy.\n\n4. **Asymmetry Term (`-a_4 * ((N-Z)^2)/A`):** This term favors nuclei with roughly equal numbers of protons and neutrons. While both Fe-56 and U-238 deviate slightly from perfect symmetry, U-238 has a larger neutron excess, making this term more unfavorable compared to Fe-56.\n\n5. **Pairing Term (`δ`):** This term adds a small amount of extra stability when either protons or neutrons exist in even numbers. Both Fe-56 and U-238 benefit from this term since they both have even numbers of protons and neutrons. However, the impact of this term is relatively minor compared to the other terms.\n\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDue to the combined effects of the Coulomb repulsion and the surface effect being more pronounced in heavier nuclei like U-238, its binding energy per nucleon is lower than that of Fe-56.

The potential energy between these nucleons is governed by both attractive strong nuclear forces (short range) and repulsive electrostatic forces (long range). \n\n2. **Attractive Well:** At small separations, the strong force dominates, creating a deep \"potential well\" where the system has low energy. This represents a stable nucleus.\n\n3. **Repulsive Rise:** As we increase the separation between nucleons (imagine stretching the nucleus), the repulsive Coulomb force becomes more significant, causing the potential energy to rise sharply.\n\n4. **Fission Barrier:** There exists an energy barrier that must be overcome for the nucleus to split into smaller fragments. This barrier arises due to the combined effect of the strong and electromagnetic forces.\n\n5. **Fragmentation:** Once enough energy is supplied to surpass the barrier, the nucleus fissions into two or more daughter nuclei. These fragments have lower binding energies per nucleon compared to the original nucleus.\n\n6. **Energy Release:** Since the total binding energy after fission is greater than before, the excess energy is released as kinetic energy of the fragments and other forms like gamma rays and neutrons.\n\n**Liquid Drop Model Analogy:**\n\n* The liquid drop model simplifies the nucleus as a droplet of incompressible fluid held together by surface tension (analogous to the strong force).\n* Stretching the droplet requires work against surface tension, similar to overcoming the fission barrier.\n* When the droplet splits, its surface area increases, leading to a decrease in overall energy (like the release of energy during fission).\n\n**Sketch:** Imagine a graph with separation distance on the x-axis and potential energy on the y-axis. You would see a curve resembling a well with a peak representing the fission barrier.\n\n**(b) Source of Energy Released in Fission**\n\nThe energy released in fission comes primarily from the difference in *binding energy per nucleon* between the parent nucleus and the resulting daughter nuclei. Heavier nuclei tend to have lower binding energy per nucleon compared to medium-sized nuclei. During fission, the nucleus breaks down into fragments with higher average binding energy per nucleon, releasing the extra energy.\n\n**(c) Why Elements Heavier Than Iron Don't Spontaneously Fission**\n\nElements heavier than iron but lighter than lead generally don't undergo spontaneous fission because their binding energy per nucleon is relatively high. They haven't reached the point where splitting into smaller nuclei would result in a net gain of binding energy.

Binding Energy Dependence on A:**\n\n* **Empirical Observation:**  Experimental data shows that the binding energy per nucleon (BE/A) generally increases with *A* up to iron (Fe, around A=56), then plateaus and slightly decreases for heavier nuclei. \n\n* **Approximation:** For simplicity, let's focus on the general trend where BE/A increases with *A*. In this regime, the binding energy is approximately proportional to *A*, although not perfectly linear.\n\n* **Reasoning:** The strong nuclear force responsible for holding nucleons together has a short range. Each nucleon interacts primarily with its nearest neighbors. As the number of nucleons (*A*) increases, there are proportionally more interactions, leading to a higher overall binding energy. However, the increase isn't strictly quadratic because some nucleons might be \"buried\" within the nucleus and have fewer effective interactions than those on the surface.\n\n**2.

This strong attraction overcomes the tendency to decay, making the neutron stable within the nucleus.\n\n* **Lambda Particle Instability:** A lambda particle (Λ) is a baryon composed of one strange quark and two up quarks. While it also feels the strong force, it does so differently than a neutron. The Λ particle cannot participate in the same type of strong interactions as protons and neutrons.

This number must be conserved.\n* **Conservation of Strangeness:** Strange particles like kaons carry strangeness. In this case, the initial state has zero strangeness, so the final state must also have zero strangeness.\n\n**3.

In a parity-conserving world, physical laws should look the same after such an inversion.\n\n* **Muon Decay Helicity:** Muons have intrinsic angular momentum called spin.  In their rest frame, muons produced in the pion decay tend to be polarized with their spins aligned opposite to their direction of motion.

The weak interaction responsible for this decay naturally favors producing left-handed particles like the muon.\n\n* **Muons and Weak Interaction:** The muon decay proceeds through the weak interaction, which is known to maximally violate parity. The V-A structure of the weak interaction couples preferentially to left-handed fermions.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the observed parity violation arises primarily from the nature of the weak interaction governing the muon decay, not from any inherent property of the pion decay.\n\n\\[\\boxed{ \\text{Only the } \\mu^+ \\to e^+ + \\nu_e + \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu \\text{ decay violates parity.} } \\]\n", "final_answers": ["\\text{Only the } \\mu^+ \\to e^+ + \\nu_e + \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu \\text{ decay violates parity.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Only the } \\mu^+ \\to e^+ + \\nu_e + \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu \\text{ decay violates parity.}", "expr2": "\\frac{dN}{d\\Omega} = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} \\cos \\theta"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Only the } \\mu^+ \\to e^+ + \\nu_e + \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu \\text{ decay violates parity.}", "expr2": "\\text{Both decay processes violate parity conservation.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Since the cross-section increases linearly with energy, we can write it as $\\sigma = k E_\\nu$, where *k* is a constant of proportionality.\n* **Mean Free Path:** This is the average distance a particle travels before undergoing an interaction. It is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles and the interaction cross-section.\n\n**3. Setting up the Calculation:**\n\nLet:\n\n*  *L* be the required length of the detector.\n* *N<sub>A</sub>* be Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>).\n\nThe number density (*n*) of target nuclei in the detector is given by:\n\n $$ n = \\frac{\\rho N_A}{\\langle A \\rangle} $$\n\nThe mean free path ($\\lambda$) for the neutrinos is:\n\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{1}{n \\sigma} = \\frac{1}{(\\rho N_A / \\langle A \\rangle)(k E_\\nu)} = \\frac{\\langle A \\rangle}{\\rho N_A k E_\\nu}$$\n\nFor 1 out of every 10<sup>6</sup> neutrinos to interact, the detector length should be approximately equal to 10<sup>6</sup> times the mean free path:\n\n$$ L \\approx 10^6 \\lambda $$\n\n**4. Solving for L:**\n\nSubstitute the values provided:\n\n$$ L \\approx 10^6 \\cdot \\frac{\\langle A \\rangle}{\\rho N_A k E_\\nu} $$\n\nSince we don't have the value of *k*, we cannot get a numerical answer. However, we can compare the options given:\n\n* Option (a): 6 km = 6 x 10<sup>3</sup> m\n* Option (b): 480 m\n* Option (c): 5 m\n\nGiven the large energy of the neutrinos (1000 GeV), even if *k* is relatively small, the mean free path will likely be quite long. Therefore, option (a) seems most reasonable.\n\n\n\\[\\boxed{ \\text{(a) } 6 \\, \\text{km}} \\]\n", "final_answers": ["\\text{(a) } 6 \\, \\text{km}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{(a) } 6 \\, \\text{km}", "expr2": "L = 480 \\, \\text{m}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

We need to focus on angular momentum conservation here.\n\n* **Initial State:** The π⁻ meson is in the lowest-energy Coulomb wavefunction, meaning it has *l=0* (s-wave). The deuteron is in its ground state with *total angular momentum J=1*. Since it's in a triplet state ($^3S_1$), its orbital angular momentum must be *L=0*, and its spin angular momentum is *S=1*.\n\n* **Final State:** Two neutrons have intrinsic spin *s=1/2 each*. To conserve angular momentum, the two neutrons must combine to form a state with a specific total angular momentum (*J*) and orbital angular momentum (*L*).\n\n* **Possible Combinations:** Considering the possible combinations of neutron spins, they can either align parallel (spin up - spin up or spin down - spin down) resulting in *S=1* or antiparallel (spin up - spin down or spin down - spin up) resulting in *S=0*. For *S=1*, the allowed values of *L* are 0, 2 due to the Clebsch-Gordan series rules. For *S=0*, only *L=0, 2* are allowed as well.\n\nTherefore, the possible orbital angular momenta of the neutron pair are **L=0 or L=2**.\n\n\n\n**(b) Total Spin Angular Momentum**\n\nAs discussed above, the total spin angular momentum of the neutron pair can be either **S=0 or S=1**.\n\n**(c) Probability of Opposite Spins**\n\nTo calculate the probability of finding both neutron spins opposite to the deuteron's spin, we need to consider the following:\n\n* **Deuteron Spin Projection:** The deuteron is initially 100% polarized along the k-direction, implying its spin projection along the k-axis is *m<sub>d</sub>=+1*.\n\n* **Neutron Spin Projections:** We want the probability where one neutron has spin projection *m<sub>n1</sub>=-1/2* and the other has *m<sub>n2</sub>=+1/2* (or vice versa). This corresponds to a combined neutron spin projection of *m<sub>nn</sub>=0*.\n\n* **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:** These coefficients determine the probabilities of different spin projections within a given total spin state. We need to use them to calculate the probability of obtaining *m<sub>nn</sub>=0* from the combination of *m<sub>n1</sub>* and *m<sub>n2</sub>*.\n\nThe calculation involves using the appropriate Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining the individual neutron spins to get a total spin of *S=0*.

The pion has negative parity, and the deuteron has positive parity. Therefore, the neutron pair must also have negative parity.\n\n* **Angular Distribution:** The angular distribution of the emitted neutron will depend on the relative orientations of the neutron spins and the deuteron spin. Since the deuteron is polarized along the k-direction, the angular distribution will exhibit anisotropy.\n\n* **Spherical Harmonics:** Spherical harmonics describe the angular dependence of wavefunctions.

As kaons decay, the flux decreases.\n\n**2. Relevant Formulae:**\n\nWe can use the following formula for radioactive decay:\n\n*  N(t) = N₀ * exp(-λt)\n\nWhere:\n\n    * N(t): Number of particles remaining after time t\n    * N₀: Initial number of particles\n    * λ: Decay constant (related to the lifetime τ by λ = ln(2)/τ )\n    * t: Time elapsed\n\n**3. Relate Flux to Particle Number:**\n\nThe flux Φ is proportional to the number of particles N. So we can rewrite the decay equation as:\n\n* Φ(t) = Φ₀ * exp(-λt)\n\n**4. Calculate the Decay Constant:**\n\nGiven the lifetime τ = 1.2 × 10⁻⁸ s, we find the decay constant:\n\n* λ = ln(2) / τ = ln(2) / (1.2 × 10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 5.78 × 10⁷ s⁻¹\n\n**5.

Since they have relativistic energy E = 2 GeV, we can calculate their velocity. However, since the question asks for a relatively small distance compared to typical cosmic scales, we can approximate the kaons moving at nearly the speed of light (c).\n\n\n* t = d/c\n\nNow substitute into our flux equation:\n\n* 0.1Φ₀ = Φ₀ * exp(-λ(d/c))\n\nSimplify and solve for 'd':\n\n* 0.1 = exp(-λd/c)\n* ln(0.1) = -λd/c\n* d = -c * ln(0.1) / λ\n\n**6.

This decay violates this rule as it converts a muon into an electron without any other particles carrying away the missing muon number.\n\n**(b) Detector Setup and Signal**\n\nTo detect the μ⁺ → e⁺ + γ decay, we need to look for the simultaneous detection of a positron (e⁺) and a photon (γ). Here's how I'd set up the experiment:\n\n* **Stopping Target:** A thin target material where muons will come to rest after being slowed down by the beamline.\n* **NaI Crystals:** Two sodium iodide scintillating crystals placed symmetrically around the stopping target.

{"id": "atomic/2-46", "solution": "Here's a breakdown of the answers:\n\n\n**(a)**\n\n* **Principal Sequence:** The primary process powering the Sun is the proton-proton (pp) chain. Here's a simplified outline:\n\n    1.  **Step 1:** Two protons fuse to form deuterium ($^2H$), releasing a positron ($e^+$) and an electron neutrino ($\\nu_e$).\n        $$p + p \\rightarrow ^2H + e^+ + \\nu_e $$\n\n    2.  **Step 2:** Deuterium fuses with another proton to create helium-3 ($^3He$) and release gamma radiation ($\\gamma$).\n       $$^2H + p \\rightarrow ^3He + \\gamma$$\n\n    3.  **Step 3:** Two helium-3 nuclei combine to produce helium-4 ($^4He$) and release two protons.\n       $$^3He + ^3He \\rightarrow ^4He + 2p$$\n\n* **Slow Link:** The slowest step in this chain is the first one – the fusion of two protons. This is because it involves overcoming strong electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged protons.\n\n* **Mean Energy of Neutrinos:** The majority of neutrinos produced come from Step 1. These neutrinos carry away only a small fraction (~0.26 MeV) of the total energy released in the entire pp chain (~26 MeV). Therefore, the average energy of these neutrinos is around **0.26 MeV**.\n\n* **Expected Number Flux:** The solar luminosity (total power output) is about $3.8 \\times 10^{26}$ watts. Assuming all this energy comes from the pp chain and knowing the Earth-Sun distance, we can calculate the neutrino flux.\n\n   The number flux (number per unit area per second) is given by:\n\n   $$\\Phi = \\frac{\\text{Luminosity}}{4\\pi d^2 E_\\nu}$$\n\n   where:\n\n   * Luminosity ≈ $3.8 \\times 10^{26} W$\n   * *d* = Earth-Sun distance ≈ $1.5 \\times 10^{11} m$\n   * $E_\\nu$ ≈ Average neutrino energy ≈ $0.26 \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-13} J$ (converting MeV to Joules)\n\n   Plugging in these values gives us a rough estimate of the neutrino flux on Earth.\n\n\n\n**(b)**\n\n* **Minor Reactions & Higher Energy Neutrinos:** A less common branch of the pp chain produces higher-energy neutrinos through the following steps:\n\n    1.  **Branching Point:** Instead of fusing directly with another proton after forming, deuterium can capture an electron, becoming tritium ($^3H$).\n      $$^2H + e^- \\rightarrow ^3H + \\nu_e$$\n\n    2.  **Tritium Decay:** Tritium decays into helium-3, emitting an electron and an antineutrino ($\\bar{\\nu}_e$).\n     $$^3H \\rightarrow ^3He + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e$$\n\n    These neutrinos from tritium decay have energies up to ~19 keV, significantly higher than those from the main pp chain.\n\n* **Homestake Experiment:** The Homestake experiment aimed to detect these higher-energy neutrinos using a large tank filled with tetrachloroethylene ($C_2Cl_4$). Chlorine-37 ($^{37}Cl$) within the liquid could undergo inverse beta decay when struck by a high-energy neutrino, producing Argon-37 ($^{37}Ar$).\n\n    $$^{37}Cl + \\nu_e \\rightarrow ^{37}Ar + e^-$$\n\n    The $^{37}Ar$ atoms were chemically extracted and counted, providing a measure of the neutrino interaction rate.\n\n* **Findings:** The Homestake experiment found a much lower rate of neutrino interactions than predicted by standard solar models. This discrepancy became known as the \"solar neutrino problem.\" Subsequent experiments confirmed this deficit, suggesting either problems with our understanding of stellar evolution or new physics beyond the Standard Model. Later experiments like Super-Kamiokande and Sudbury Neutrino Observatory provided evidence for neutrino oscillations, where neutrinos change flavor as they travel, explaining part of the missing solar neutrinos.\n\n\n\n\nLet me know if you would like more details on any specific aspect!", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

This makes them interact very weakly with matter.\n* **Spin-1/2 Fermions:**  Neutrinos belong to a class of particles called fermions, which obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. They possess a spin angular momentum of 1/2, making them half-integer spin particles.\n* **Weak Interaction Only:** Neutrinos primarily interact through the weak force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. This interaction is responsible for radioactive decay processes.\n* **Three Flavors:** There are three types, or flavors, of neutrinos: electron neutrinos (νₑ), muon neutrinos (νμ), and tau neutrinos (ντ). Each flavor corresponds to its associated charged lepton (electron, muon, and tau).\n\n**Physical Motivation for Postulation:**\n\nIn the early 20th century, physicists observed that energy and momentum were not conserved in beta decay experiments. For example, when a neutron decays into a proton, an electron, and another particle, the total energy and momentum before and after the decay didn't match up. To resolve this discrepancy, Wolfgang Pauli proposed the existence of a new, undetected particle – the neutrino – that carried away the missing energy and momentum.\n\n**First Direct Detection:**\n\nThe direct detection of neutrinos proved incredibly challenging due to their weak interactions. It wasn't until 1956 that Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines successfully detected antineutrinos produced in a nuclear reactor using a large tank of water surrounded by scintillation detectors.

{"id": "atomic/2-12", "solution": "Here's how we can derive the given formula and address the experimental considerations:\n\n\n**(a) Derivation**\n\nThe key idea behind this formula lies in understanding how the strong nuclear force treats protons and neutrons.  Since they belong to the same isospin doublet (meaning they have similar interactions), their mass differences arise primarily from electromagnetic effects. \n\n1. **Isospin Symmetry:** Isotopic spin ($I$) is a quantum number analogous to angular momentum but related to the symmetry between protons and neutrons within the nucleus. It assumes these particles interact identically under the strong force except for their electric charge difference.\n\n2. **Mass Operator:** We represent the mass of a nucleon using an operator *M*. This operator should reflect the contributions from both the strong interaction (which is largely independent of isospin) and the electromagnetic interaction (which depends on the proton/neutron nature).\n\n3. **Expanding the Mass Operator:** A general expansion of the mass operator could include terms proportional to various powers of the isospin operators. However, due to the near-identical behavior of protons and neutrons under the strong force, only even powers of $T_z$ will contribute significantly. Odd powers would break the symmetry unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Specific Terms:**\n\n   * **Constant Term (*a*)**: Represents the average mass contribution common to all nucleons in the isobar group, arising mainly from the strong force.\n\n   * **Linear Term (*bT<sub>z</sub>*)**: Accounts for the mass difference between the neutron ($T_z = -1/2$) and proton ($T_z = +1/2$).\n\n   * **Quadratic Term (*cT<sub>z</sub><sup>2</sup>*)**: Captures any additional mass splitting beyond the simple proton-neutron difference. While less dominant than the linear term, it might account for subtle variations within larger isospin multiplets.\n\nTherefore, combining these arguments leads us to the proposed mass operator:\n\n$$ M = a + bT_z + cT_z^2.$$\n\n\n\n**(b) Experimental Testing**\n\nTo experimentally verify this formula, you need an isospin multiplet with at least three members. Here's why:\n\n* **Two Members:** With just two members (like the proton-neutron pair), you can determine *a* and *b*, but not *c*. You wouldn't know if there were higher-order corrections contributing to the mass difference.\n\n* **Three or More Members:** Having three or more members allows you to fit the data to the quadratic equation and extract values for *a*, *b*, and *c*. This provides a stronger test of the formula's validity.\n\nExamples of suitable isospin multiplets for testing include:\n\n* **Nucleon Isotriplet (N):** Proton (p), Neutron (n), and a hypothetical particle called the $\\Delta^{++}$ baryon.\n\n* **Delta Baryon Quartet ($\\Delta$):** Four particles with different charges ($\\Delta^{++}$, $\\Delta^+$, $\\Delta^0$, $\\Delta^-$) forming an isospin quartet (I=3/2).\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\boxed{ I \\ge 1}\\]\n", "final_answers": ["I \\ge 1"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "I \\ge 1", "expr2": "M = a + bT_z + cT_z^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "I >= 1", "expr2": "T**2*c + T*b + a"}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": "unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'GreaterThan' and 'Add'"}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "I \\ge 1", "expr2": "T = 1"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "I >= 1", "expr2": "1"}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": "unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'GreaterThan' and 'One'"}], "accuracy": 0.0}

These operators have components proportional to $I_+, I_-, I_z$.\n\n* **Relative Sizes:** Since the magnetic moments of protons and neutrons differ significantly, the isovector component will dominate the overall magnetic moment operator.

First, convert everything to consistent units:\n\n   * Distance: 5000 light-years * (9.461 × 10¹⁵ m/light-year) = 4.7305 × 10²⁰ meters\n   * Time: 13 minutes * (60 seconds/minute) = 780 seconds\n\nNow calculate the required velocity (v):\n\n   * v = distance / time = (4.7305 × 10²⁰ m) / (780 s) ≈ 6.065 × 10¹⁷ m/s\n\nThis velocity is very close to the speed of light (c).\n\n* **Step 3: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\n γ = 1 / √(1 - (v²/c²))\n\nSince v is almost equal to c, γ will be a large number. You can approximate this using a calculator or software capable of handling such calculations.\n\n* **Step 4: Calculate Total Energy**\n\nTotal energy (E) = γmc², where m is the rest mass of the neutron (940 MeV). Convert MeV to Joules first if needed.\n\n* **Step 5: Final Answer**\n\n\n\n\\[\\boxed{E}\\]\n\n**(b) Rest Mass of π⁺ Meson**\n\n* **Step 1: Apply Conservation Laws**\n\nIn any particle decay process, several conservation laws hold true:\n\n    * Conservation of energy: The total energy before the decay equals the total energy after the decay.\n    * Conservation of momentum: The total momentum before the decay equals the total momentum after the decay.\n\n* **Step 2: Set up Equations Based on Conservation Laws**\n\nLet M be the rest mass of the π⁺ meson. Using the given information and conservation laws, you can set up equations relating the energies and momenta of the particles involved before and after the decay. Remember that the neutrino has zero rest mass but carries away some kinetic energy and momentum.\n\n* **Step 3: Solve for the Unknown (M)**\n\nSolve the system of equations derived in Step 2 to find the value of M, the rest mass of the π⁺ meson.\n\n* **Step 4: Final Answer**\n\n\n\n\\[\\boxed{M}\\]\n\nRemember to show all your work and clearly state your assumptions throughout the calculation.

A point charge model doesn't account for this variation in contribution.\n\n**5.

Electron Scattering:**\n\n* **Measured Quantity:**  The angular distribution of scattered electrons after they interact with the nucleus. \n* **Relation to Radius:** Electrons scatter off the positively charged protons within the nucleus. By analyzing the angles at which electrons are deflected, we can infer the spatial distribution of charge within the nucleus.

Energy Levels of Muonic Atoms:**\n\n* **Measured Quantity:** The precise energy differences between different energy levels of muonic atoms. A muon is similar to an electron but much heavier.\n* **Relation to Radius:** When a muon orbits a nucleus, it experiences a stronger electrostatic attraction due to its larger mass compared to an electron.

Each term represents a different contribution to the overall stability:\n\n* **Term 1:**  *a₁A*: This term accounts for the attractive strong force between nucleons. It assumes a roughly constant interaction strength per nucleon.\n\n* **Term 2:** *-a₂A^(2/3)*: This term represents the surface tension effect. Nucleons on the surface have fewer neighbors compared to those inside the nucleus, leading to less binding. The *(2/3)* power arises from the surface area scaling as *A^(2/3)*.\n\n* **Term 3:** *-a₃Z²A^(-1/3)*: This term describes the electrostatic repulsion between protons. The repulsive Coulomb force increases quadratically with the number of protons (*Z²) but decreases with increasing nuclear size (*A^(-1/3)*).\n\n* **Term 4:** *-a₄(A - 2Z)²A^(-1)*: This term accounts for the asymmetry between neutrons and protons. Nuclei tend to be more stable when the neutron-to-proton ratio is close to unity.\n\n**(b) Relationship Between A and Z for Isobaric Nuclei**\n\nIsobaric nuclei have the same mass number *A*. To find the most stable configuration within an isobar, we need to minimize the binding energy with respect to *Z*, treating *A* as a constant.\n\n1. **Minimize BE:** Take the derivative of the binding energy equation with respect to *Z* and set it equal to zero:\n\n   ```\n   d(BE)/dZ = -2a₃ZA^(-1/3) + 2a₄(A - 2Z)A^(-1) = 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Solve for Z:** Rearrange the equation to solve for *Z*:\n\n   ```\n   2a₃ZA^(-1/3) = 2a₄(A - 2Z)A^(-1)\n   Za₃/(2a₄A^(2/3)) = A - 2Z\n   Z(a₃/(2a₄A^(2/3)) + 2) = A\n   Z = A / (a₃/(2a₄A^(2/3)) + 2)\n   ```\n\nThis equation gives the value of *Z* that minimizes the binding energy for a given *A*, representing the most stable isotopic composition among isobars.\n\n**(c) Estimating a₄ using the Fermi Gas Model**\n\nThe Fermi gas model treats nucleons as non-interacting fermions confined within a potential well representing the nucleus.

For simplicity, let's consider only neutrons.\n\n2. **Neutron Density:** Assuming uniform density, the average neutron density ρ is proportional to *A*/(*V*), where *V* is the nuclear volume. Using the given nuclear radius *R = R₀A^(1/3)*, we get:\n\n    ```\n    ρ ≈ A / (4πR³/3) = A / (4πR₀³A) = 1 / (4πR₀³)\n    ```\n\n3. **Fermi Energy:** The Fermi energy *εF* is related to the density through:\n\n    ```\n    εF = (ħ²/2m)(3π²ρ)^(2/3)\n    ```\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant and *m* is the neutron mass.\n\n4. **Asymmetry Energy:** When there's an imbalance between neutrons and protons, some energy levels become occupied by one type while remaining empty for the other. This difference contributes to the asymmetry energy.\n\n5. **Estimation:** A rough estimation of *a₄* involves calculating the change in Fermi energy due to a small deviation from symmetric neutron-proton ratios.

{"id": "atomic/2-13", "solution": "Here's a breakdown of why there's such a large difference in excitation energies for the T=1 states of  $^{14}_7N$ and $^{12}_6C, along with an explanation of how isospin is assigned:\n\n**Understanding Isospin**\n\n* **Concept:** Isospin (T) is a quantum number that describes the symmetry between protons and neutrons within the nucleus. It treats protons and neutrons as two states of the same particle – the nucleon. Just like spin can be \"up\" or \"down,\" nucleons can have isospin projections (+1/2 for proton, -1/2 for neutron).\n\n* **Multiplets:** Nucleons combine into multiplets based on their total isospin (T), similar to how electrons form multiplets due to spin. For example, a system of two nucleons can have T=0 (singlet state) or T=1 (triplet state).\n\n* **Symmetry & Energy:** Strong interactions conserve isospin. This means that if you start with a nucleus having a certain isospin, strong interaction processes will not change its isospin. However, electromagnetic interactions do *not* conserve isospin.\n\n**Why the Difference in Excitation Energies?**\n\n\nThe significant difference in excitation energies arises from the interplay of these factors:\n\n1. **Nuclear Structure:**\n\n   * **$^{14}_7N$:** Nitrogen-14 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. Its ground state ($T=0$) likely involves pairing of protons and neutrons, leading to a relatively stable configuration. Exciting it to a $T=1$ state requires breaking up some of these pairs and rearranging nucleons, requiring less energy.\n\n   * **$^{12}_6C$:** Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. In its ground state ($T=0$), it might already possess more symmetrical arrangements of protons and neutrons compared to nitrogen-14. To reach a $T=1$ state, carbon-12 needs a more substantial rearrangement of nucleons, demanding significantly higher energy.\n\n2. **Coulomb Repulsion:** Protons repel each other due to electrostatic forces. When transitioning to a $T=1$ state, where the imbalance between protons and neutrons increases, Coulomb repulsion becomes stronger in lighter nuclei like carbon-12, contributing to the larger excitation energy.\n\n**Other Members of the T=1 Triplet**\n\nFor both $^{14}_7N$ and $^{12}_6C$, the $T=1$ triplet consists of three states:\n\n* **$|T, M_T> = |1, 1>$**: Highest energy state (most asymmetric proton-neutron distribution).\n* **$|T, M_T> = |1, 0>$**: Intermediate energy state.\n* **$|T, M_T> = |1,-1>$**: Lowest energy state (most symmetric proton-neutron distribution among the triplet).\n\nThese states differ slightly in energy due to subtle differences in the spatial arrangement of nucleons and residual interactions beyond the simple isospin considerations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{The large difference in excitation energies for the } T=1 \\text{ states of }^{14}_7N \\text{ and }^{12}_6C \\text{ stems primarily from variations in nuclear structure and Coulomb repulsion.} } \\]\n", "final_answers": ["\\text{The large difference in excitation energies for the } T=1 \\text{ states of }^{14}_7N \\text{ and }^{12}_6C \\text{ stems primarily from variations in nuclear structure and Coulomb repulsion.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{The large difference in excitation energies for the } T=1 \\text{ states of }^{14}_7N \\text{ and }^{12}_6C \\text{ stems primarily from variations in nuclear structure and Coulomb repulsion.}", "expr2": "2.3 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{The large difference in excitation energies for the } T=1 \\text{ states of }^{14}_7N \\text{ and }^{12}_6C \\text{ stems primarily from variations in nuclear structure and Coulomb repulsion.}", "expr2": "15.0 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

This ensures sufficient resolution to discern details within the nucleus. \n* **Interaction Strength:**  The probe should interact strongly enough with the nucleus to produce measurable effects but not so strongly that it completely disrupts the nucleus.

Classically, one would expect the atoms to be deflected into a continuous distribution due to their varying magnetic moments. However, the experiment showed that the atoms were deflected into discrete beams, indicating that the angular momentum of the electrons was quantized – meaning it could only take on specific values. \n\n* **Contribution to Quantum Theory:** The Stern-Gerlach experiment provided direct evidence for the quantization of angular momentum, a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. It demonstrated that certain properties of particles, like spin, are not continuous but exist in discrete units.\n\n**(b) Compton Effect (1923)**\n\n* **Description:** Arthur Compton observed that when X-rays scattered off electrons, they lost energy and had longer wavelengths than the incident X-rays. This phenomenon couldn't be explained by classical wave theory, which predicted no change in wavelength upon scattering.\n\n* **Contribution to Quantum Theory:** The Compton effect provided strong support for the particle nature of light. By treating photons as particles with momentum, Compton successfully explained the shift in wavelength using conservation laws.

Volume Term (-a<sub>V</sub>A<sup>1/3</sup>):** This term accounts for the strong nuclear force that binds nucleons together.

Thus, it scales approximately with the volume proportional to *A*, hence the *A<sup>1/3</sup>* dependence.\n\n   * Approximate value of *a<sub>V</sub>*: ~15.8 MeV\n\n**3. Surface Term (-a<sub>S</sub>A<sup>1/2</sup>):** Nucleons on the surface experience fewer attractive forces compared to those in the interior. This \"surface tension\" effect reduces the overall binding energy and depends on the surface area of the nucleus, which scales roughly as *A<sup>2/3</sup>*. We rewrite this as *A<sup>1/2</sup>* for convenience.\n\n    * Approximate value of *a<sub>S</sub>*: ~16.0 MeV\n\n**4. Coulomb Term (-a<sub>C</sub>Z(Z-1)/A):** Protons repel each other due to their positive charges.

No specific selection rules apply.\n\n* **Gamma Ray Emission:** Allowed if there are suitable excited states in $^{81}\\text{Kr}$ within the available energy range. Electromagnetic transition probabilities depend on multipole order and selection rules based on angular momentum and parity changes.\n\n* **Alpha Particle Emission:** Less likely than neutron emission because it requires overcoming a larger Coulomb barrier. Also subject to alpha particle tunneling probability considerations.\n\n* **Beta Plus Decay:** Requires weak interactions and may be hindered by the large Q value needed to overcome the electron rest mass and create the positron. It would also need to compete with gamma ray emission if energetically allowed.\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{See completed table above.}} \\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{See completed table above.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{See completed table above.}", "expr2": "\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\text{Isotopes} & Z & T_z & T & J^p & \\text{Mass excess (MeV)} \\\\\n\\hline\nn & 0 & -1/2 & 1/2 & 1/2^+ & 8.07 \\\\\n^1\\text{H} & 1 & 1/2 & 1/2 & 1/2^+ & 7.29 \\\\\n^4\\text{He} & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0^+ & 2.43 \\\\\n^{77}\\text{Se} & 34 & -9/2 & 9/2 & 1/2^- & -74.61 \\\\\n^{77}\\text{Br} & 35 & -7/2 & 7/2 & 3/2^- & -73.24 \\\\\n^{77}\\text{Kr} & 36 & -5/2 & 5/2 & 7/2^+ & -70.24 \\\\\n^{80}\\text{Br} & 35 & -5 & 5 & 1^+ & -76.89 \\\\\n^{80}\\text{Kr} & 36 & -4 & 4 & 0^+ & -77.90 \\\\\n^{81}\\text{Br} & 35 & -11/2 & 11/2 & 3/2^- & -77.98 \\\\\n^{81}\\text{Kr} & 36 & -9/2 & 9/2 & 7/2^+ & -77.65 \\\\\n^{81}\\text{Rb} & 37 & -7/2 & 7/2 & 3/2^- & -77.39 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{See completed table above.}", "expr2": "J^\\pi = 3/2^-, \\quad T = 11/2, \\quad T_z = -9/2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{See completed table above.}", "expr2": "\\Delta E = 10.36 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{See completed table above.}", "expr2": "Q_1 = 2.54 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{See completed table above.}", "expr2": "Q_2 = 10.36 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{See completed table above.}", "expr2": "Q_3 = 4.89 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{See completed table above.}", "expr2": "Q_4 = 9.67 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
