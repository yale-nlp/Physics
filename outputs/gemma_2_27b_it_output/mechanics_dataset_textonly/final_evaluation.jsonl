Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We have a particle moving under the influence of a central force, meaning the force only depends on the distance from the origin (the center of attraction). This implies that angular momentum is conserved.\n* The provided equation  `r = ae^(-bθ)` describes the shape of the orbit in polar coordinates. Our goal is to determine the form of the potential energy function `U(r)` responsible for this specific trajectory.\n\n**2. Using Conservation Laws:**\n\n* **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** For a central force, the angular momentum per unit mass (`l`) is constant: \n   ```\n   l = r² dθ/dt \n   ```\n* **Energy Conservation:** The total mechanical energy (`E`) is also conserved:\n   ```\n   E = ½(dr/dt)² + ½(r dθ/dt)² + U(r)\n   ```\n\n**3.

You will obtain an expression involving `a`, `b`, `l`, and `r`.\n\n* Now substitute the expressions for `dr/dt` and `dθ/dt` into the energy conservation equation. Simplify as much as possible.

Let the new speed of the electron be *v'* and the new radius be *r'*.\n    - New Potential Energy: $PE' = -\\frac{2ke^2}{r'}$\n    - To find the new kinetic energy, we use conservation of angular momentum. Since no external torque acts on the system, the angular momentum remains constant:\n       - Before Emission: $L = mvr_0$\n       - After Emission: $L = mv'r'$\n       - Therefore, $mv'r' = mvr_0$ or $v' = \\frac{v r_0}{r'}$\n    - Now, substitute this value of *v'* into the expression for kinetic energy: $KE' = \\frac{1}{2}m(\\frac{vr_0}{r'})^2 = \\frac{mv^2r_0^2}{2r'^2}$\n    - Total Final Energy: $E_f = KE' + PE' = \\frac{mv^2r_0^2}{2r'^2} - \\frac{2ke^2}{r'}$\n\n* **Ratio of Energies:** Divide the final energy by the initial energy:\n   $\\frac{E_f}{E_i} = \\frac{\\frac{mv^2r_0^2}{2r'^2} - \\frac{2ke^2}{r'}}{\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{ke^2}{r_0}}$\n\nTo simplify further, you would need to express *v* in terms of known quantities using the initial condition that the electron was initially in a stable orbit (centripetal force balanced by electrostatic attraction). However, the key point here is understanding the setup and the change in energy due to the altered nuclear charge.\n\n\n\n**(b) Qualitative Description of the New Orbit**\n\n\nSince the nuclear charge doubled while the electron remained bound, the attractive force between them increased. This will cause the electron to spiral inward towards the nucleus. Due to the nature of the inverse square law governing electrostatic forces, the electron won't simply fall directly onto the nucleus but will instead settle into a new, more tightly bound elliptical orbit.\n\n**(c) Distance of Closest and Farthest Approach**\n\nFor an elliptical orbit, the distances of closest and farthest approach correspond to the perihelion and aphelion respectively. These points represent when the radial velocity of the electron is momentarily zero. You can determine these distances using conservation of energy and angular momentum along with the equation for the trajectory of an ellipse.\n\n**(d) Major and Minor Axes of the New Elliptical Orbit**\n\nThe major axis of the ellipse is the longest diameter, passing through both foci (the nucleus being one focus). The minor axis is the shortest diameter, perpendicular to the major axis and also passing through the center of the ellipse. Determining these lengths requires solving the equations of motion for the electron under the influence of the central force from the doubly charged nucleus.

We consider the entire system consisting of the spaceship, the rope, and the satellite as our system.\n\n* **Step 2:** Apply Newton's Second Law. Since the spaceship is accelerating, there must be a net force acting on it. This force comes from the engines propelling the spaceship forward. Let 'F' represent this force. Applying Newton's second law (F = ma):\n\n   F = (mass of spaceship + mass of rope + mass of satellite) * acceleration\n\n* **Step 3:** Calculate the masses.\n    * Mass of rope = (length of rope) * (mass per unit length) = 50 m * 1 kg/m = 50 kg\n    * Total mass = 950 kg (satellite) + 50 kg (rope) + mass of spaceship (unknown)\n\n* **Step 4:** Substitute values into the equation.

The segment experiences three forces:\n    * Tension T(x) pulling towards the spaceship.\n    * Tension T(x + Δx) pulling away from the spaceship.\n    * Gravitational force which is negligible since we are in empty space.\n\n* **Step 3:** Apply Newton's Second Law to the segment. Assuming the segment has a very small mass (approaching zero), its acceleration will be equal to that of the spaceship (5 m/s²).\n\n   T(x) - T(x + Δx) = (Δx * mass per unit length) * 5 m/s²\n\n* **Step 4:** Simplify using limits. As Δx approaches zero, the difference in tensions becomes a derivative:\n\n   dT/dx = (mass per unit length) * 5 m/s² = 1 kg/m * 5 m/s² = 5 N/m\n\n* **Step 5:** Integrate to find the tension as a function of position. Integrating both sides gives us:\n\n   T(x) = 5x + C\n\nwhere C is the integration constant.\n\n* **Step 6:** Determine the boundary condition. At the point where the rope connects to the spaceship (x=0), the tension is equal to the force exerted by the spaceship on the rope. So, T(0) = F.\n\n* **Step 7:** Solve for the integration constant and write the complete expression for tension:\n\n   C = F\n   T(x) = 5x + F\n\n**(c) Consequences of Deceleration**\n\nWhen the spaceship decelerates at 1 m/s², several things happen:\n\n* **Tension Change:** The tension in the rope will decrease because the spaceship is now slowing down. Using the same analysis as before, the new tension would be given by T'(x) = -x + C', where C' represents the new force exerted by the spaceship during deceleration.\n\n* **Rope Slackening:** If the deceleration is significant enough, the tension might become zero somewhere along the rope. This means the rope could slacken or even detach from the satellite.\n\n* **Satellite Motion:** The satellite will continue moving forward due to inertia, potentially drifting further away from the spaceship unless some other corrective action is taken.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions!", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

This means the gravitational force exerted by Earth isn't always directed towards its center.  Near the poles, gravity pulls slightly stronger than expected for a perfect sphere, while near the equator, it's slightly weaker.\n\n* **Impact on Orbit:** \n    * **Shape:** The non-central force introduces periodic variations in the orbital plane. Imagine the satellite experiencing a slight \"tug\" sideways as it passes over the equatorial bulge – this can cause the ellipse to precess (rotate slowly) around the original orbital plane.\n    * **Orientation:** The direction of the major axis of the ellipse may shift gradually over time due to this precession.\n\n**(b) Atmospheric Drag**\n\n* **Effect:** Even at high altitudes, there's still some trace atmosphere. As the satellite travels through this thin air, it experiences friction (drag), losing energy. Importantly, this effect is strongest near perigee (the point closest to Earth) where the atmosphere is denser.\n\n* **Impact on Orbit:**\n    * **Shape:** Drag removes energy from the orbit. Since energy is related to both speed and altitude, the satellite loses speed and its apogee (farthest point from Earth) decreases.

{"id": "mechanics/1_57", "solution": "Here's a step-by-step derivation of the collision cross sections:\n\n**1. Understanding the Setup:**\n\n* We have a charged pion approaching a massive, positively charged nucleus. \n* The interaction between them is purely electrostatic.\n*  We assume the pion is non-relativistic, meaning its speed is much less than the speed of light. This allows us to use classical mechanics.\n* The 'collision' occurs when the pion gets within a distance *b* from the center of the nucleus. This defines our scattering target area.\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy:**\n\nThe total mechanical energy of the system (pion + nucleus) remains constant since we neglect nuclear recoil. At large distances, the pion only possesses kinetic energy *T*. As it approaches the nucleus, this kinetic energy is partially converted into potential energy due to the Coulomb repulsion/attraction.\n\nLet:\n\n* *r*: Distance between the pion and the nucleus.\n* *v*: Speed of the pion.\n\nAt any point during the motion:\n\nTotal Energy = Kinetic Energy + Potential Energy\n\n $$ T = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + V(r)$$\n\nWhere:\n\n* *m* is the mass of the pion.\n* *V(r)* is the electrostatic potential energy given by:\n\n$$V(r) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{Ze^2}{r} & \\text{for } \\pi^+ \\\\\n-\\frac{Ze^2}{r} & \\text{for } \\pi^-\n\\end{cases}$$\n\n **3.

At this point, all its initial kinetic energy has been transformed into potential energy:\n\n$$0 = \\frac{1}{2}mv_{min}^2 + V(r_{min})$$\n\nSince *v<sub>min</sub> = 0*, we get:\n\n$$T = V(r_{min})$$\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$ r_{min} = \\begin{cases}\nb & \\text{for } \\pi^+ \\\\\nb & \\text{for } \\pi^-\n\\end{cases}$$\n\n\n**4. Collision Cross Section:**\n\nThe collision cross section (σ) represents the effective area presented by the nucleus for a collision with the pion. It can be visualized as the area swept out by the trajectory of the pion if it were to just graze the nucleus at a distance *b*. Since the problem assumes a circular target area, the cross section is simply:\n\n$$\\sigma = \\pi b^2$$\n\nHowever, not every pion with kinetic energy *T* will collide.

Understanding the Setup:**\n\n* **Monochromatic Radiation:** We have light (electromagnetic radiation) with a single frequency being emitted from the Sun ($\\nu_s$) and observed on Earth ($\\nu_e$).\n* **Gravitational Redshift:** This phenomenon causes light to lose energy (and therefore decrease in frequency) as it climbs out of a gravitational well. The stronger the gravity, the greater the redshift.\n* **Riemannian Metric:**  The provided metric describes spacetime curvature due to gravity. In this simplified case, only the time component ($g_{00}$) is affected by the gravitational potential Φ.\n\n**2.

However, since we are dealing with gravity rather than simple motion, we need to modify this equation.\n\n**3. Time Dilation Due to Gravity:**\n\nEinstein's theory of general relativity tells us that time runs slower in stronger gravitational fields.

Combining Concepts:**\n\nNow let's connect these ideas:\n\n* Light travels along null geodesics, meaning its path follows $ds^2=0$. Using the metric, for radial travel outwards from the Sun:\n\n$$0 = g_{00} dt^2 - dr^2$$\n\n* Since the light travels radially outward, we can consider the time elapsed at the emission point (Sun) and reception point (Earth):\n\n$$\\int_{t_s}^{t_e} \\sqrt{g_{00}} dt = \\int_{r_s}^{r_e} dr$$\n\n* Substituting our approximation for $g_{00}$ and integrating both sides gives us a relationship between the times measured at the Sun and Earth.\n\n* Finally, we use the fact that the number of wave crests passing a point in a given time interval determines the observed frequency. Therefore, the ratio of frequencies will be inversely proportional to the ratio of time intervals experienced at each location.\n\n\n**5.

Understanding Stability**\n\nA circular orbit is considered stable if small perturbations (deviations from the perfect circle) lead to oscillations around the original orbit rather than causing the particle to spiral inwards or outwards. \n\n**2. Setting up the Problem**\n\n* **Central Force:** The force acting on the particle is directed towards the center of the circle and its magnitude depends only on the radial distance *r*. We denote this force as  *F = -f(r)* (negative sign indicates inward direction).\n\n* **Circular Motion:** For a stable circular orbit, the centripetal force required for circular motion must be provided entirely by the central force:\n\n   ```\n   m*v^2/r = f(r) \n   ```\n    where *m* is the mass of the particle and *v* is its orbital speed.\n\n**3. Small Perturbations**\n\nLet's introduce a small perturbation to the radius, denoted by *ε*:\n\n ```\n r → r + ε\n ```\n\nThis will cause a change in the force and consequently affect the particle's velocity.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Change in Force**\n\nThe change in force due to the perturbation can be approximated using Taylor series expansion:\n\n```\nΔf ≈ (∂f/∂r)|_r * ε\n```\n\nSince we want to analyze stability, we focus on the linear term in the expansion.\n\n**5. Effective Potential Energy**\n\nIt's helpful to consider the effective potential energy (*U*) associated with the system. This includes both the actual potential energy due to the force and the kinetic energy contribution arising from the centrifugal force:\n\n```\nU(r) = -∫f(r) dr + (L²/2mr²)\n```\n\nWhere *L* is the angular momentum of the particle, which remains constant for a central force.\n\n**6. Condition for Stability**\n\n\nFor stability, the effective potential should have a minimum at the equilibrium point (the radius of the unperturbed circular orbit). This means the second derivative of the effective potential with respect to *r* must be positive at the equilibrium point:\n\n```\nd²U/dr² |_(equilibrium) > 0\n```\n\n**7. Deriving the Stability Criterion**\n\nNow let's calculate the second derivative of the effective potential and evaluate it at the equilibrium point:\n\n* Calculate dU/dr\n* Set dU/dr = 0 to find the equilibrium radius (this corresponds to the radius of the initial circular orbit).\n* Calculate d²U/dr².\n* Substitute the equilibrium radius into d²U/dr² and simplify.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, you will arrive at the desired stability criterion:\n\n $$\nf(r) > -\\left(\\frac{r}{3}\\right) \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r}\\right|_r\n$$\n\n\n\n\\[\\boxed{f(r) > -\\left(\\frac{r}{3}\\right) \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r}\\right|_r}\\]\n", "final_answers": ["f(r) > -\\left(\\frac{r}{3}\\right) \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r}\\right|_r"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "f(r) > -\\left(\\frac{r}{3}\\right) \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r}\\right|_r", "expr2": "f(r) > -\\frac{r}{3} \\left. \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r} \\right|_r"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "f(r) > -r/3", "expr2": "f(r) > -r/3"}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": "unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'StrictGreaterThan' and 'StrictGreaterThan'"}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Since the initial momentum of both masses is zero, after the impulse,  the total momentum of the system will be equal to *I*. Let *v₁* be the velocity of *m₁* immediately after the impulse and *v₂* be the velocity of *m₂* immediately after the impulse. We have:\n\n*I = m₁v₁ + m₂v₂*\n\n* **Step 2: Conservation of Energy**\n\nAfter the impulse, the system has kinetic energy which will be converted into potential energy stored in the spring as it oscillates. At maximum compression (when *m₂* momentarily comes to rest), all the kinetic energy is transformed into potential energy. Using conservation of energy:\n\n*(1/2)m₁v₁² + (1/2)m₂v₂² = (1/2)kx²*\n\nwhere *x* is the maximum displacement of the spring (and also the distance *m₂* travels before stopping).\n\n* **Step 3: Solving for x**\n\nWe need to eliminate *v₁* and *v₂* from the equations above to find *x*. From the impulse equation, we get:\n\n*v₁ = (I - m₂v₂) / m₁*\n\nSubstitute this expression for *v₁* into the energy conservation equation and solve for *x*. This will involve some algebraic manipulation but ultimately you'll arrive at an expression for *x* in terms of *I*, *m₁, *m₂, and *k*.\n\n\n**(b) Rotation Without Oscillation**\n\nFor the system to rotate without oscillation, the center of mass must remain stationary. After the impulse, if the velocities of *m₁* and *m₂* are such that their individual momenta cancel each other out, then the center of mass won't move. In this case, the system would simply rotate around the fixed center of mass.\n\nTo achieve this, the following condition needs to hold:\n\n*m₁v₁ = m₂v₂*\n\nThis means the impulse should be delivered in a way that gives *m₁* and *m₂* velocities proportional to their masses. However, since the impulse acts only on *m₁*, achieving this specific relationship between *v₁* and *v₂* might not be directly achievable through a single impulse.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you want me to work through the algebra to explicitly solve for *x* in part (a)!", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

However, it ran into problems when applied to electromagnetism, particularly with Maxwell's equations. \n\n* **The Problem:** Maxwell's equations predicted that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers, regardless of their own motion. This contradicted Newtonian mechanics, which stated that velocities should add up relative to different reference frames. For example, if you throw a ball on a moving train, its velocity would be the sum of the train's velocity plus the velocity you threw it with.  But according to Maxwell, light wouldn't behave this way – its speed would remain constant even if you were observing it from a moving platform.\n\nThis created a fundamental conflict between two very successful theories. Einstein resolved this dilemma with his special theory of relativity.\n\n**(b) An Alternative Theory and Its Refutation**\n\nOne alternative theory proposed before special relativity was the **luminiferous aether**. Physicists hypothesized that light waves needed a medium to travel through, just like sound waves need air. They called this hypothetical medium \"aether.\"\n\n* **The Michelson-Morley Experiment:** In 1887, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley conducted a famous experiment designed to detect the presence of aether. Their idea was that Earth's movement through the aether would create a detectable difference in the speed of light depending on the direction of measurement. However, they found no such difference. This null result strongly suggested that there was no aether, paving the way for Einstein's revolutionary ideas about space and time.\n\n**(c) Modern Evidence Supporting Special Relativity**\n\n* **Muon Decay:** Muons are unstable subatomic particles created high in the atmosphere by cosmic rays. They decay rapidly, with a lifetime of only about 2.2 microseconds. According to classical physics, muons shouldn't reach the ground because they would decay long before arriving. However, due to their high speeds (close to the speed of light), time dilation occurs as predicted by special relativity. From our perspective, muon lifetimes appear longer, allowing them to reach the surface.

We need to account for centrifugal force when analyzing motion in this frame.\n\n**2.

Due to the repulsive force, it experiences a torque which changes its angular momentum. This leads to a slow precession of the ellipse. To calculate the rate of precession, we need to analyze the change in angle per orbital period.\n\nThis involves using techniques like perturbation theory or Lagrangian mechanics. A detailed derivation requires more complex calculations involving calculus of variations and solving differential equations.

Using this condition, we can solve for C.\n\n* **Solving for t:** Once you have C, you can rearrange the equation to solve for *t* when *v* reaches the terminal velocity of 30 m/s. This will give you the time taken to reach terminal velocity.\n\n**(b) Distance Traveled before Reaching Terminal Velocity**\n\n* **Relating Velocity and Displacement:** We know the velocity as a function of time from the previous part. To find distance, we need to integrate velocity over time:\n\n*x = ∫ v dt*\n\nIntegrate the expression for *v* obtained earlier with respect to *t*, applying appropriate limits of integration (from t=0 to the time calculated in part (a)).\n\n**(c) Knee Bending Distance**\n\n* **Deceleration and Spring Force:** When the parachutist lands, her knees act like a spring. The maximum deceleration she experiences should be limited to 10g. This means the acceleration during impact should be -10 * 9.8 m/s² = -98 m/s².\n\nLet 'x' be the distance her knees bend. The force exerted by the \"spring\" in her knees is proportional to the displacement: F = kx.\n\nApplying Newton's second law again:\n\n*ma = kx*\n\nWe know *a* (-98 m/s²) and *m*. Solve for x.\n\n**(d) Validity of Proportional Air Resistance Assumption**\n\n\n\nAir resistance isn't always perfectly proportional to speed. Here's why:\n\n* **Low Speeds:** At low speeds, air resistance is often approximately proportional to speed. This is because the airflow around the object is relatively smooth and laminar.\n\n* **High Speeds:** As speed increases, the airflow becomes turbulent. This turbulence creates more drag, and the relationship between air resistance and speed becomes more complex than simply proportional.\n\n* **Shape Matters:** The shape of the object significantly influences air resistance. Streamlined objects experience less drag compared to blunt objects.\n\nTherefore, while assuming proportional air resistance simplifies calculations, it might not be entirely accurate, especially at high speeds. For a more precise analysis, more sophisticated models considering factors like Reynolds number and fluid dynamics would be needed.\n\n\n\n\nLet me know if you want help working through the detailed integrations and calculations!\n", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

Destructive interference happens when two waves meet out of phase (peaks align with troughs), resulting in cancellation. \n* **Loudness I When Sounded Alone:** Each fork individually produces a measurable sound intensity *I* at point A.\n\n**Why Doesn't Energy Disappear?**\n\nThe key here is understanding that the total energy isn't actually disappearing; it's just being redistributed due to wave interference. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Energy from each Fork:** When each tuning fork vibrates, it converts its mechanical energy into sound energy, which propagates outwards as a wave.\n\n2. **Superposition Principle:** When the waves from both forks overlap, they combine according to the principle of superposition. This means the amplitudes of the individual waves add up at every point in space.\n\n3. **Destructive Interference:** At point A, the peaks of one wave perfectly coincide with the troughs of the other wave. Their amplitudes cancel each other out, leading to zero amplitude (and hence zero intensity) at that specific location.\n\n4. **Energy Redistribution:** While the intensity is zero at point A, the energy hasn't vanished. It has been redirected to other locations. The combined wave pattern will have regions of constructive interference where the intensities are higher than *I*, compensating for the region of destructive interference at point A.\n\n\n**Analogy:** Imagine two people throwing pebbles into a pond simultaneously. If they throw them directly at each other, the ripples might completely cancel out in the middle, creating a calm spot.

It often involves solving an integral or using numerical methods.\n\n\n\n**(c) Differential Scattering Cross Section**\n\n1. **Definition:** The differential scattering cross section $dσ/dΩ$ represents the probability per unit solid angle that a particle incident along a particular direction will be scattered into a small solid angle element dΩ around a given scattering angle θ.\n\n2. **Relationship to Impact Parameter:** For a central potential like ours, the differential scattering cross section is related to the impact parameter through:\n\n    \\[\\frac{dσ}{dΩ} = \\left| \\frac{b}{\\sinθ} \\frac{db}{dθ}\\right|\\]\n\n3. **Finding db/dθ:** This requires differentiating the relation between *b* and θ obtained in part (b).\n\n4. **Final Expression:** Substitute the expressions for *b* and *db/dθ* into the formula above to obtain the differential scattering cross section as a function of the scattering angle θ.\n\n\n\n\nLet me know if you need help working out the detailed calculations for parts (b) and (c)!

Understanding Doppler Effect:**\n\nThe Doppler effect describes the change in frequency of a wave (like sound) for an observer moving relative to the source of the wave. When the source and observer are moving closer together, the observed frequency is higher than the emitted frequency. Conversely, when they are moving apart, the observed frequency is lower.\n\n**2.  Frames of Reference:**\n\n* **Source Frame:** This is the rest frame where the sound source is stationary. The frequency of the sound here is simply ω.\n* **Lab Frame:** This is the frame where we have the observer and the moving wall. \n\n**3. Applying the Relativistic Doppler Effect Formula:**\n\nSince the wall is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of sound, we need to use the relativistic Doppler effect formula:\n\n $$f_{obs} = f_s \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}$$\n\nwhere:\n\n*  $f_{obs}$ is the observed frequency in the lab frame.\n*  $f_s$ is the source frequency (ω in our case).\n*  $v$ is the velocity of the wall relative to the observer (in this case, $-vβ$, negative because it's approaching).\n*  $c$ is the speed of sound ($v$).\n\n**4. Calculating Observed Frequency:**\n\nSubstituting the values into the equation:\n\n$$f_{obs} = \\omega \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\beta}{1 + \\beta}}$$\n\nThis shows that the observed frequency is different from the source frequency due to the motion of the wall.\n\n**5. Beats:**\n\nBeats occur when two waves with slightly different frequencies interfere. Since the reflected sound wave has a different frequency than the original wave due to the Doppler effect, interference between them will produce beats.\n\n**6. Beat Frequency:**\n\nThe beat frequency is the difference between the two interfering frequencies:\n\n$$f_{beat} = |f_{obs} - \\omega| = \\omega \\left| \\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\beta}{1+\\beta}} - 1 \\right|$$\n\n**7. Audible Range Calculation:**\n\nLet's assume the following:\n\n* Bottom of human audible range: 20 Hz\n* Top of human audible range: 20,000 Hz\n\nWe want to find β such that the observed frequency is at the top of the audible range:\n\n$$20,\\!000 \\, \\text{Hz} = \\omega \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\beta}{1 + \\beta}}$$\n\nSolving for β requires some algebraic manipulation. You can start by squaring both sides and rearranging terms.

This simplifies calculations significantly.\n* **Gravity Inside Earth:**  The key concept here is that gravity inside a uniformly dense sphere only depends on the mass enclosed within the radius from the center to your location. As you descend deeper, less mass pulls on you, weakening the gravitational force.\n* **Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM):** The motion of the object will resemble simple harmonic motion because the restoring force (gravity) is proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position (the center of the Earth).\n\n**Solution**\n\n1. **Gravitational Force Inside Earth:**\n\n   Consider a point mass *m* located at a distance *r* from the center of the Earth. The mass enclosed within a sphere of radius *r* is given by:\n\n   ```\n   M(r) = (4/3)πρr³ \n   ```\n\n   where ρ is the density of Earth.\n\n   Using Newton's law of gravitation, the force acting on *m* due to this enclosed mass is:\n\n   ```\n   F(r) = GmM(r)/r² = G m (4/3)πρr / r² = (4/3)Gπρmr\n   ```\n\n2. **Equation of Motion:**\n\n   This force acts like a spring force pulling the object towards the center. Applying Newton's second law:\n\n   ```\n   ma = F(r) => ma = (4/3)Gπρmr\n   ```\n\n   Simplifying, we get the equation of SHM:\n\n   ```\n   a = (4/3)Gπρr\n   ```\n\n3. **Angular Frequency (ω'):**\n\n   For SHM, angular frequency (ω') is related to acceleration and displacement by:\n\n   ```\n   a = -ω'²r\n   ```\n\n   Comparing this with our previous equation, we find:\n\n   ```\n   ω'² = (4/3)Gπρ\n   ```\n\n4. **Period of Oscillation (T):**\n\n    The period of oscillation (time taken for one complete trip back and forth) is related to angular frequency by:\n\n    ```\n    T = 2π/ω' = 2π / √((4/3)Gπρ)\n    ```\n\n5. **Tunnel 1 (Along Rotation Axis):**\n\n   In this case, the object oscillates directly through the center of the Earth. Its period of oscillation is simply T calculated above.\n\n6. **Tunnel 2 (Equatorial):**\n\n   While the object still undergoes SHM, its path is slightly longer than the diameter of the Earth due to the curvature. However, since the difference in path length is relatively small compared to the Earth's radius, the period remains approximately equal to T.\n\n\n**Final Answers**\n\n\n\n\\[\\boxed{T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\frac{4}{3}G\\pi\\rho}}} \\]\n\n**Friction Considerations**\n\nIt is not equally necessary for both tunnels to be frictionless. While friction would slow down the object in either tunnel, the effect would be more pronounced in Tunnel 2 due to the longer path length.
