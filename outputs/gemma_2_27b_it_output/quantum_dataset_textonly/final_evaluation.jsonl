They enter a region where the magnetic field changes abruptly from pointing in the z-direction ($B_1 \\mathbf{e}_z$) to the x-direction ($B_2 \\mathbf{e}_x$). This change in magnetic field will cause the neutron spins to precess.\n\n* **Precession in Magnetic Fields:** The Hamiltonian describing the interaction of a neutron's spin with a magnetic field is given by:\n\n   $$H = -\\gamma \\mathbf{S} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$$\n\n    Where:\n     * $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the neutron.\n     * $\\mathbf{S}$ is the spin operator.\n     * $\\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field vector.\n\n* **Time Evolution Operator:** The time evolution of the spin state is governed by the Schrödinger equation:\n\n   $$i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial |\\psi(t)\\rangle}{\\partial t} = H|\\psi(t)\\rangle $$\n\n   The formal solution to this equation involves the time evolution operator:\n\n   $$|\\psi(t)\\rangle = U(t)|\\psi(0)\\rangle$$\n\n   where $U(t) = e^{-iHt/\\hbar}$.\n\n* **Finding the Time Evolution Operator:** For our specific case, we need to find the time evolution operator for each region separately due to the different magnetic fields. Let's denote the operators for regions I and II as $U_I(t)$ and $U_{II}(t)$, respectively.\n\n* **Region I:** In region I, the Hamiltonian is $H_I = -\\gamma B_1 S_z$. Solving the Schrödinger equation gives us:\n\n   $$U_I(t) = e^{i\\gamma B_1 S_zt/\\hbar}$$\n\n* **Region II:** Similarly, in region II, the Hamiltonian is $H_{II} = -\\gamma B_2 S_x$. The corresponding time evolution operator is:\n\n   $$U_{II}(t) = e^{i\\gamma B_2 S_xt/\\hbar}$$\n\n* **Initial State:** At $t=0$, the neutron is in the $|+z\\rangle$ state. Therefore, $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = |+z\\rangle$.\n\n* **Final State:** To get the spin wavefunction for $t>0$, we need to apply the appropriate time evolution operator based on which region the neutron is in. Since the neutron transitions instantaneously from region I to II at $t=0$, the wavefunction for $t>0$ is:\n\n   $$|\\psi(t)\\rangle = U_{II}(t) U_I(0)|+z\\rangle = e^{i\\gamma B_2 S_xt/\\hbar} |+z\\rangle$$\n\n\n\n**(b) Fraction of Spins in Each Direction**\n\nTo determine the probability of finding the spin in a particular direction, we need to calculate the expectation value of the corresponding spin projection operator.\n\n* **Expectation Value:** The expectation value of an observable $A$ is given by:\n\n$$\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle \\psi(t) | A | \\psi(t) \\rangle$$\n\n* **Spin Projection Operators:** The spin projection operators for the x, y, and z directions are:\n\n   * $S_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n   * $S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n   * $S_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n* **Calculating Probabilities:** You can now use these operators and the wavefunction obtained in part (a) to calculate the probabilities:\n\n   * Probability of spin in +x direction: $\\left| \\langle +x | \\psi(t) \\rangle \\right|^2$\n   * Probability of spin in +y direction: $\\left| \\langle +y | \\psi(t) \\rangle \\right|^2$\n   * Probability of spin in +z direction: $\\left| \\langle +z | \\psi(t) \\rangle \\right|^2$\n\nThese calculations involve matrix multiplication and taking the modulus squared of complex numbers.\n\n**(c) Abruptness of Transition**\n\nFor the above analysis to hold, the transition between regions I and II needs to be sufficiently abrupt so that during the transition itself, the neutron doesn't have enough time to significantly precess within either field. This means the duration of the transition should be much shorter than the characteristic precession periods in both regions.\n\nMathematically, if $\\tau$ represents the transition time, then:\n\n * $\\tau << \\frac{2\\pi}{\\gamma B_1}$\n * $\\tau << \\frac{2\\pi}{\\gamma B_2}$\n\n\n\n\nLet me know if you want help working through the detailed calculations for the probabilities in part (b).", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

Its electron configuration is 1s². This means both electrons occupy the lowest available orbital, the 1s orbital.\n\n* **Energy Levels:** Due to electron-electron interactions, the energy levels of helium are more complex than those of hydrogen. The ground state will be the most stable configuration, followed by excited states where one or both electrons are promoted to higher orbitals.\n\n* **Quantum Numbers:** We need to consider the following quantum numbers for each electron:\n    * **Principal quantum number (n):** Describes the electron shell (1, 2, 3...).\n    * **Angular momentum quantum number (l):** Defines the shape of the orbital (0=s, 1=p, 2=d,...).\n    * **Magnetic quantum number (ml):** Specifies the orientation of the orbital in space (-l ≤ ml ≤ l).\n    * **Spin quantum number (ms):** Represents the intrinsic angular momentum of the electron (+1/2 or -1/2).\n\n* **Total Angular Momentum and Parity:** For multi-electron atoms, we also need to consider the total angular momentum (L) and parity (even or odd) of the system. These arise from combining the individual angular momenta and parities of the electrons.\n\n* **Ground State (1s²):** Both electrons are in the 1s orbital.\n   * n₁ = n₂ = 1\n   * l₁ = l₂ = 0\n   * ml₁ = ml₂ = 0\n   * ms₁ = +1/2, ms₂ = -1/2 (to satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle)\n   * L = 0 (both spins cancel out)\n   * Parity = even (since both electrons are in s orbitals)\n\n* **First Excited States:** One electron gets promoted to a higher orbital while the other remains in the 1s orbital. There are several possibilities here:\n    * **1s2s ³S₁:** One electron in 1s (n₁=1, l₁=0), one in 2s (n₂=2, l₂=0). Total L=0, S=1 (triplet state due to parallel spins), Parity=even.\n    * **1s2p ¹P₁:** One electron in 1s (n₁=1, l₁=0), one in 2p (n₂=2, l₂=1).

This principle plays a crucial role in determining the level ordering because it restricts the possible configurations of electrons within an atom.\n\nIn helium, the Pauli principle dictates that the two electrons cannot both occupy the same state (same n, l, ml, ms values). Therefore, they must have opposite spins when occupying the same spatial orbital (e.g., 1s²) . This leads to different energy levels depending on whether the spins are aligned (parallel, triplet state) or opposed (antiparallel, singlet state).\n\n**(c) Perturbation Formulas**\n\nWe can use perturbation theory to approximate the energies of the helium states using the known hydrogenic solutions as a starting point.

Understand Magnetic Susceptibility:**\n\n* **Definition:** Magnetic susceptibility (χ) measures a material's magnetization response to an applied magnetic field. It indicates how easily a substance can be magnetized. \n* **Paramagnetism:** Materials with positive χ are weakly attracted to magnets. This occurs when they have unpaired electrons that align their spins with the external field.\n* **Diamagnetism:** Materials with negative χ are weakly repelled by magnets. This arises from induced currents within the atoms opposing the applied field.\n\n**2. Helium's Electronic Configuration:**\n\n* Helium has two electrons, both occupying the 1s orbital.  The Pauli Exclusion Principle dictates that these electrons must have opposite spins.\n\n**3. Determine if Helium is Paramagnetic or Diamagnetic:**\n\n* Since all electrons in helium are paired, there are no unpaired electrons available to align with an external magnetic field. Therefore, helium exhibits **diamagnetism**.\n\n**4. Estimating Diamagnetic Susceptibility:**\n\nFor simple systems like helium, we can use the following formula for estimating the diamagnetic susceptibility:\n\nχ ≈ - (N * e^2 * <r^2> ) / (6m_e * c^2)\n\nWhere:\n\n* N = number of electrons\n* e = elementary charge\n* <r^2> = average squared radius of the electron orbit (can be approximated using Bohr model for simplicity)\n* m_e = mass of the electron\n* c = speed of light\n\n**5. Approximations:**\n\n* For helium, N = 2.\n* We'll use the Bohr radius (a₀) as an approximation for <r²>. The Bohr radius is approximately 0.53 Ångströms². Convert this to meters: a₀ ≈ 5.3 x 10⁻¹¹ m. So, <r²> ≈ (5.3 x 10⁻¹¹ m)²\n\n**6. Calculation:**\n\nPlug the values into the formula and calculate χ. Remember to convert units appropriately.

Let's analyze this phenomenon for the ground state (n=1) of the hydrogen atom:\n\n\n**Step 1: Hamiltonian with Electric Field:**\n\n* The unperturbed Hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom is given by:\n\n $$H_0 = \\frac{p^2}{2m} - \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r}$$\n\nwhere $p$ is momentum, $m$ is electron mass, $e$ is elementary charge, $\\epsilon_0$ is permittivity of free space, and $r$ is distance from the nucleus.\n\n* When an external electric field **E** is applied along the z-axis, we add a perturbation term to the Hamiltonian:\n\n$$ H' = -eEz$$\n\nThis represents the potential energy due to the interaction between the electron and the electric field.\n\n**Step 2: Perturbation Theory:**\n\nWe use time-independent perturbation theory to find the shift in energy levels caused by the electric field. For non-degenerate states like the n=1 ground state, the first-order correction to the energy is:\n\n$$\\Delta E^{(1)} = \\langle \\psi_0 | H' | \\psi_0 \\rangle$$\n\nWhere $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ is the unperturbed ground state wavefunction.\n\n**Step 3: Ground State Wavefunction:**\n\nThe ground state wavefunction for hydrogen is spherically symmetric:\n\n$$ |\\psi_{100}\\rangle = R_{10}(r)Y_{00}(\\theta,\\phi)$$\n\nwhere $R_{10}(r)$ is the radial part and $Y_{00}(\\theta,\\phi)$ is the spherical harmonic function corresponding to l=0, m=0. Importantly, this wavefunction has no dependence on the azimuthal angle φ or polar angle θ.\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Expectation Value:**\n\nSince the ground state wavefunction doesn't depend on *z*, the expectation value becomes:\n\n$$\\Delta E^{(1)} = \\langle \\psi_{100} | -eEz | \\psi_{100} \\rangle = -eE \\int \\psi^*_{100} z \\psi_{100} dV$$\n\nDue to symmetry, the integral over all angles will be zero because the integrand is odd in *z*.\n\n\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, the first-order correction to the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom in an electric field is **zero**.

So:\n\n   ```\n   μ = (mₑ * mₑ) / (mₑ + mₑ) = mₑ / 2\n   ```\n\n* **Ground State Energy:** Substitute the modified reduced mass into the hydrogen atom ground state energy formula:\n\n   ```\n   E₀ (positronium) = -e² / (2 * μ * a₀) = -e² / (2 * (mₑ / 2) * a₀) = -e² / (mₑ * a₀)\n   ```\n\nSince `a₀` remains unchanged because it depends on fundamental constants, the ground state energy of positronium is twice the magnitude of the hydrogen atom's ground state energy.\n\n* **Bohr Radius:** Similarly, substitute the new reduced mass into the Bohr radius formula:\n\n   ```\n   a₀ (positronium) = ħ² / (mₑ * e²) = 2 * a₀ (hydrogen)\n   ```\n\nThe Bohr radius of positronium is twice the Bohr radius of the hydrogen atom.\n\n\n\n**(b) Spin Degeneracy and Wave Functions**\n\n\nThe electron and positron each have a spin quantum number s = 1/2.

Since photons carry integer units of angular momentum, the total angular momentum of the emitted photons must also be zero. To achieve this, at least two photons are required. If only one photon were emitted, it would carry away all the energy and angular momentum, violating conservation laws.\n\nTherefore, the annihilation of positronium always results in the emission of at least two photons.\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\begin{aligned}\n&(a)\\ E_{0}(\\text {positronium})=-\\frac{2 e^{2}}{m_{e} a_{0}}, \\\\\n&a_{0}(\\text {positronium})=2 a_{0}(\\text {hydrogen })\\\\\n&(b)\\ \\text {Degeneracy}=4,\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n|1,1\\rangle=|\\uparrow \\uparrow\\rangle \\\\\n|1,0\\rangle=\\frac{|\\uparrow \\downarrow\\rangle+|\\downarrow \\uparrow\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n|1,-1\\rangle=|\\downarrow \\downarrow\\rangle \\\\\n|0,0\\rangle=\\frac{|\\uparrow \\downarrow\\rangle-|\\downarrow \\uparrow\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\end{array}\\right.\\\\\n&(c)\\ E_{\\text {released}}=\\frac{e^{2}}{m_{e} a_{0}},\\ \\text {at least } 2 \\text {photons}\n\\end{aligned}} \\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&(a)\\ E_{0}(\\text {positronium})=-\\frac{2 e^{2}}{m_{e} a_{0}}, \\\\\n&a_{0}(\\text {positronium})=2 a_{0}(\\text {hydrogen })\\\\\n&(b)\\ \\text {Degeneracy}=4,\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n|1,1\\rangle=|\\uparrow \\uparrow\\rangle \\\\\n|1,0\\rangle=\\frac{|\\uparrow \\downarrow\\rangle+|\\downarrow \\uparrow\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n|1,-1\\rangle=|\\downarrow \\downarrow\\rangle \\\\\n|0,0\\rangle=\\frac{|\\uparrow \\downarrow\\rangle-|\\downarrow \\uparrow\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\end{array}\\right.\\\\\n&(c)\\ E_{\\text {released}}=\\frac{e^{2}}{m_{e} a_{0}},\\ \\text {at least } 2 \\text {photons}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&(a)\\ E_{0}(\\text {positronium})=-\\frac{2 e^{2}}{m_{e} a_{0}}, \\\\\n&a_{0}(\\text {positronium})=2 a_{0}(\\text {hydrogen })\\\\\n&(b)\\ \\text {Degeneracy}=4,\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n|1,1\\rangle=|\\uparrow \\uparrow\\rangle \\\\\n|1,0\\rangle=\\frac{|\\uparrow \\downarrow\\rangle+|\\downarrow \\uparrow\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n|1,-1\\rangle=|\\downarrow \\downarrow\\rangle \\\\\n|0,0\\rangle=\\frac{|\\uparrow \\downarrow\\rangle-|\\downarrow \\uparrow\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\end{array}\\right.\\\\\n&(c)\\ E_{\\text {released}}=\\frac{e^{2}}{m_{e} a_{0}},\\ \\text {at least } 2 \\text {photons}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "E_0 = -6.8 \\ \\text{eV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

We need to consider both the spatial and spin parts of the wavefunction.\n\nSince there are two possible spin states for each particle (up and down), there are four possible combined spin states:\n\n* Singlet state: $|S=0, S_z=0> = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\uparrow\\downarrow>- |\\downarrow\\uparrow>)$, antisymmetric\n* Triplet state: $|S=1, S_z=+1> = |\\uparrow\\uparrow>$ ,$|S=1, S_z=-1> = |\\downarrow\\downarrow>$, $|S=1, S_z=0> = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\uparrow\\downarrow> + |\\downarrow\\uparrow>)$, symmetric\n\nTo satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle, the spatial part of the wavefunction needs to be symmetric when the spin part is antisymmetric (singlet) and vice versa.\n\nTherefore:\n\n* For the ground state $(0,0)$, it can combine with the singlet spin state to form an overall antisymmetric state.\n* For the first excited states $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$, they can combine with the triplet spin states to form overall antisymmetric states.\n* For the second excited state $(0,2)$, it can combine with the singlet spin state to form an overall antisymmetric state.\n\n\n\n\nLet me know if you would like more details on any specific aspect!", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

The general solution to this equation is:\n\n$$R_0(r) = A \\sin(k'r) + B \\cos(k'r)$$\n\nFor *r > a*, outside the well ($V=0$), the radial equation becomes:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2}{dr^2} R_0(r) = k^2 R_0(r),$$\n\nwhere $k^2 = \\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2}$. The general solution here is:\n\n$$R_0(r) = C e^{ikr} + D e^{-ikr}$$\n\n**3. Apply Boundary Conditions:**\n\nWe need to match the solutions inside and outside the well at *r = a*. This means both the wavefunctions and their derivatives must be continuous:\n\n* **Continuity of the wavefunction:**\n\n   $$A \\sin(k'a) + B \\cos(k'a) = Ce^{ika} + De^{-ika}$$\n\n* **Continuity of the derivative:**\n\n   $$Ak'\\cos(k'a) - Bk'\\sin(k'a) = ikCe^{ika} - ike^{-ika}$$\n\n**4.

Solving this equation numerically gives us the energy dependence of the phase shift *δ₀*.\n\n\n\n**6. High Energy Limit:**\n\nIn the limit of high energies (*k → ∞*), we expect the phase shift to become small ($\\delta_0 \\rightarrow 0$). To see why, consider the physical picture: at very high energies, the particle barely \"feels\" the potential well because it passes through so quickly.\n\nTo get the leading order behavior of *δ₀* at high energies, we can expand the transcendental equation obtained earlier around *k = ∞*.

This leads to a total spin quantum number S = 0.  The wavefunction is symmetric under electron exchange.\n\n* **Triplet State:** Here, the two electrons have parallel spins (both spin up or both spin down), resulting in a total spin quantum number S = 1. The wavefunction is antisymmetric under electron exchange.\n\n**Energy Considerations**\n\nIn general, for atoms with multiple electrons, the Pauli Exclusion Principle dictates that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. However, when considering spatial symmetry, we need to account for the Coulombic repulsion between the negatively charged electrons.\n\n* **Symmetric Spatial Wavefunctions:** When the spatial part of the wavefunction is symmetric (meaning it doesn't change sign upon exchanging the positions of the electrons), the electrons tend to be closer together more often. This increases their electrostatic repulsion, leading to higher energy.\n\n* **Antisymmetric Spatial Wavefunctions:** An antisymmetric spatial wavefunction changes sign upon electron exchange. This tends to keep the electrons further apart on average, reducing their repulsion and lowering the overall energy.\n\n\n**Applying to Helium**\n\nFor the $(1s)^1(2s)^1$ configuration:\n\n* **Singlet State:** Since the spins are opposite, the spatial wavefunction must be symmetric to satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle. This results in higher energy due to increased electron repulsion.\n\n* **Triplet State:** With parallel spins, the spatial wavefunction needs to be antisymmetric. This reduces electron repulsion and leads to lower energy.\n\n\n\n**Expression for Energy Separation**\n\nWe can express the energy difference using perturbation theory. Let:\n\n* $H_0$ represent the Hamiltonian for non-interacting electrons.\n* $V$ represent the Coulomb interaction potential between the electrons.\n\nThe energy correction due to the electron-electron interaction can be approximated as:\n\n $$ \\Delta E = \\langle \\Psi | V | \\Psi \\rangle$$\n\nwhere $|\\Psi\\rangle$ is the many-electron wavefunction.

This implies translational invariance – if we shift both $\\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\\mathbf{r}_2$ by the same vector, the Hamiltonian remains unchanged.\n\n* **Rotational Invariance:** The potential also doesn't depend on the orientation of the line connecting the two particles. This means the system is rotationally invariant about its center of mass.\n\n* **Parity (Spatial Inversion):** If we invert the coordinates of both particles ($\\mathbf{r}_i \\rightarrow -\\mathbf{r}_i$), the potential remains unchanged due to the squared distance term.\n\n**(b) Constants of Motion**\n\nDue to these symmetries, we can identify the following conserved quantities (constants of motion):\n\n* **Total Momentum:** Translational invariance leads to conservation of total momentum, $\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{p}_1 + \\mathbf{p}_2$.\n\n* **Angular Momentum:** Rotational invariance implies conservation of total angular momentum, $\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{r}_1 \\times \\mathbf{p}_1 + \\mathbf{r}_2 \\times \\mathbf{p}_2$.\n\n* **Parity Operator:** Parity symmetry corresponds to a constant of motion represented by the parity operator, which inverts spatial coordinates.\n\n**(c) Ground State Wave Function**\n\nGiven that the ground state wavefunction for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is Gaussian, we can make an educated guess about the form of the ground state for our two-particle system.

This implies degeneracy.\n\n**2. Orthogonality of Solutions:**\n\nIn quantum mechanics, eigenstates (solutions with distinct eigenvalues) belonging to different energies are orthogonal. However, since we assumed degeneracy, both $\\psi_1(x)$ and $\\psi_2(x)$ correspond to the same energy E. Therefore, they should satisfy the orthogonality condition:\n\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi_1^*(x)\\psi_2(x) dx = 0$$\n\nwhere * denotes complex conjugation.\n\n**3.

However, when these atoms come together to form a crystal lattice – a highly ordered, repeating structure – things get interesting from a quantum mechanical perspective. \n\n1. **Overlapping Wavefunctions:** Imagine bringing two identical atoms close together. Their atomic orbitals (the regions where electrons are likely to be found) start overlapping. This overlap leads to interference between the electron wavefunctions.\n\n2. **Constructive and Destructive Interference:** Just like waves on water, electron wavefunctions can interfere constructively or destructively. Constructive interference results in higher probability densities for finding electrons in certain regions, while destructive interference creates nodes where electron density is low.\n\n3. **Energy Level Splitting:** Due to this interference pattern, the original discrete energy level of the isolated atom splits into multiple closely spaced energy levels within the crystal. As we add more and more atoms to build the crystal, this splitting becomes increasingly pronounced.\n\n4. **Formation of Energy Bands:**  With a vast number of atoms in a macroscopic crystal, the split energy levels become so numerous and densely packed that they effectively merge into continuous ranges called *energy bands*. These bands represent allowed energies for electrons within the crystal.\n\n5. **Band Gaps:** Importantly, gaps may exist between these energy bands, known as band gaps. Electrons cannot occupy energies within these forbidden zones. The size of the band gap determines crucial properties of the material, such as its electrical conductivity.\n\n\n**In Essence:**\n\nThe periodic arrangement of atoms in a crystal lattice causes the wavefunctions of individual atomic orbitals to interact and interfere.

This leads to tiny oscillations with an amplitude given by:\n\n   Δx ≈ √(ħ/(2 * m * ω))\n\n   where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s), m is the mass, and ω is the angular frequency.

They experience the strongest reduction in binding energy since they \"feel\" the reduced nuclear charge most directly within the nuclear volume.\n\n    * **p-states (2p, 3p):** These states have zero probability density at the origin. Their wavefunctions extend further from the nucleus, so they are less affected by the finite nuclear size than s-states.\n\n    * **d-states (3d):** Similar to p-states but even more spatially extended, leading to smaller energy shifts.\n\n* **Energy Level Diagram:**\n\n   Sketch two diagrams side-by-side:\n\n   * **Unperturbed:** Show standard hydrogenic energy levels with increasing energy going upwards (n=1, n=2, n=3...). Label the sublevels (s, p, d) appropriately.\n\n   * **Perturbed:** Draw the same diagram but with all levels slightly raised (less negative). Emphasize that the 1s level is shifted up the most, followed by 2s, then 2p, etc.\n\n\n\n**(b) First Order Energy Shift for 1s State**\n\nWe use time-independent perturbation theory.

We can approximate the wavefunction overlap primarily within this region.\n\nUse the expressions for $\\psi_{2s}$ and $\\psi_{2p}$, along with the modified potential $V'(r)$, to calculate the first-order energy corrections for both states. Then find the difference between them to obtain the 2s-2p splitting. You should arrive at an expression proportional to $R$.\n\n**(d) Limitations of Perturbation Theory**\n\nPerturbation theory breaks down when the perturbation becomes too large compared to the original Hamiltonian. In this case, if the nuclear radius $R$ becomes comparable to or larger than the Bohr radius $a_{\\mu}$, the approximation of treating the finite nuclear size as a small perturbation fails.\n\nIn such cases, perturbation theory would *underestimate* the energy shift.

The Potential:**\n\nThe hard sphere potential is defined as:\n\n*  V(r) = ∞ for r < R \n*  V(r) = 0 for r ≥ R\n\nThis means particles cannot penetrate the sphere, only interact with it on its surface.\n\n**2.

At specific energies corresponding to bound states within the well, the electron's wavefunction inside the well becomes sinusoidal and matches smoothly onto the outgoing plane wave outside. This results in zero scattering because there is constructive interference between the incident and reflected waves, effectively canceling out any deviation from the original plane wave.\n\n[Diagram: Show a potential well with a few bound state energy levels.

When the electron's energy approaches a resonant energy level associated with a quasi-bound state within the potential, the scattering amplitude becomes very large.\n\nThis occurs because the electron spends more time \"trapped\" near the nucleus before escaping, leading to enhanced interaction and scattering.\n\n[Diagram: Show a potential with both attractive and repulsive regions.

For example, if an excited state lacks inversion symmetry, a linear Stark effect will occur as the electric field directly couples to the dipole moment induced in the atom.\n\n   * **Sodium:** While sodium also has degenerate excited states, the presence of multiple electrons and the less symmetrical electronic configuration make these degeneracies harder to break linearly.

This means the neutron pair also has zero orbital angular momentum ($l_{nn}=0$).\n\n\n\n**(b) Total Spin Angular Momentum**\n\n* **Neutron Spins:** Each neutron has a spin quantum number of $s_n=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n* **Total Spin:** Since the neutrons have identical particles with half-integer spin, they obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. Their combined spin can either be parallel (triplet state, $S_{nn}=1$) or antiparallel (singlet state, $S_{nn}=0$).\n\n**(c) Probability of Opposite Spins**\n\n* **Deuteron Spin:** The deuteron is in a triplet state ($S_d=1$), so its projection along any axis can be $+1$, $0$, or $-1$.\n\n* **Probability Calculation:** For the neutron pair to have opposite spins compared to the deuteron, one neutron needs to have spin up ($\\uparrow$) while the other has spin down ($\\downarrow$). Let's consider the case where the deuteron spin is aligned along the z-axis (+1).\n\n    * The possible states for the neutron pair are then $|↑↓⟩$ and $|↓↑⟩$. These states form a basis for the singlet state ($S_{nn}=0$).\n\n    * The probability of finding the neutron pair in the singlet state depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients involved in combining the individual neutron spins. However, since there are only two possibilities for the neutron pair configuration when their spins are opposite, and these configurations correspond to the singlet state, the probability is simply 1/2.\n\n   Therefore, the probability of finding both neutron spins directed opposite to the spin of the deuteron is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\n**(d) Angular Distribution**\n\n* **Spin Dependence:** The angular distribution of emitted neutrons will depend on the relative orientation of their spins with respect to the deuteron's spin.\n\n* **Polarization:** With the deuteron fully polarized in the $\\hat{R}$ direction, we need to express the outgoing neutron's wavefunction in terms of spherical coordinates $(\\theta,\\phi)$ related to the $\\hat{R}$ direction.\n\n* **Angular Momentum Coupling:** The angular part of the neutron wavefunction will involve spherical harmonics coupled to the total angular momentum of the system. Due to the complexity of the calculation involving Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and spherical harmonic expansions, providing a closed-form expression for the angular distribution without further assumptions would be quite lengthy.\n\nLet me know if you want to explore specific aspects of the angular distribution calculation in more detail!", "final_answers": ["\\frac{1}{2}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{1}{2}", "expr2": "L_2 = 1"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "1/2", "expr2": "1"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{1}{2}", "expr2": "S = 1"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "1/2", "expr2": "1"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{1}{2}", "expr2": "0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "1/2", "expr2": "0"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{1}{2}", "expr2": "\\frac{3}{16\\pi} \\sin^2 \\theta"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "1/2", "expr2": "3*sin(theta)**2/(16*pi)"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

This tells us how easily the electron cloud distorts in response to a weak magnetic field.\n\n* **Perturbation Theory:** Since the magnetic field is treated as a perturbation, we can use time-independent perturbation theory.  The Hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field is given by:\n\n   $$H = H_0 + H'$$\n\n   where $H_0$ is the unperturbed Hamiltonian (for no magnetic field), and $H'$ is the perturbation due to the magnetic field. For a uniform magnetic field along the z-axis, the perturbation is:\n\n   $$H' = -\\mu_B B S_z $$\n\n    Where:\n     * $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton.\n     * $B$ is the magnetic field strength.\n     * $S_z$ is the spin angular momentum operator along the z-axis.\n\n* **First Order Correction:** In first order perturbation theory, the energy correction is given by:\n\n   $$\\Delta E^{(1)} = \\langle \\psi_0 | H'| \\psi_0 \\rangle$$\n\n   where $\\psi_0$ is the unperturbed ground state wavefunction. However, since the ground state has total angular momentum F = 0, its spin projection along any axis is zero ($\\langle S_z \\rangle = 0$). Therefore, the first-order correction vanishes:\n\n   $$\\Delta E^{(1)} = 0$$\n\n* **Second Order Correction:** To get a non-zero contribution, we need to go to second-order perturbation theory. The second-order energy correction is:\n\n   $$\\Delta E^{(2)} = \\sum_{n \\neq 0} \\frac{|\\langle \\psi_n | H' | \\psi_0 \\rangle|^2}{E_0 - E_n}$$\n\n   where the sum runs over all excited states $| \\psi_n \\rangle$.\n\n* **Estimation:** Calculating this exactly requires knowing the full spectrum of hydrogen. However, we can make a rough estimation. The dominant contributions will come from excited states close in energy to the ground state.

Evaluating the remaining terms would require detailed calculations involving the specific excited states involved.\n\n\n\n**(b) Helium Atom (Ground State 1s²)**\n\n* **Closed Shell Configuration:** The ground state of helium ($1s^2$) has two electrons both occupying the lowest energy level (1s). Both electrons have opposite spins, resulting in a singlet state with total spin angular momentum S = 0.\n\n* **Zero Magnetic Moment:** Because the total spin is zero, the helium atom in its ground state does not possess a permanent magnetic moment. Consequently, there is no linear term in the energy expansion with respect to the magnetic field.\n\n* **Polarizability Estimation:** Similar to the hydrogen case, the magnetic polarizability arises from the distortion of the electron cloud in response to the field. However, because helium has a closed shell configuration, the effect is expected to be much smaller than in hydrogen.

{"id": "quantum/1-1004", "solution": "Let's delve into the fascinating world of quantum mechanics through the lens of these groundbreaking experiments. We will focus on the photoelectric effect and the blackbody radiation spectrum to understand the quantization of energy.\n\n\n**(a) The Photoelectric Effect**\n\n* **Experimental Setup:** In this classic experiment, light is shone onto a metal surface. Electrons are emitted from the metal only when the frequency of the incident light exceeds a certain threshold value (characteristic of the metal). \n\n* **Non-Classical Observation:** Classical physics predicted that increasing the intensity of the light should increase the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons. However, the experimental results showed something entirely different:\n\n    1. **Threshold Frequency:** No electrons are emitted below a specific frequency, regardless of the light intensity. This contradicts classical expectations where any frequency should eject electrons given enough intensity.\n\n    2. **Instantaneous Emission:** Electron emission occurs instantaneously upon illumination, even with very low intensities. Classically, it would take time for electrons to absorb enough energy to escape.\n\n* **Quantum Explanation:** Einstein explained these anomalies by proposing that light exists not just as waves but also as discrete packets of energy called photons. Each photon carries energy proportional to its frequency:\n\n   $$E = h \\nu $$\n\nwhere *h* is Planck's constant and ν is the frequency. An electron absorbs a single photon; if the photon's energy exceeds the work function (binding energy) of the metal, the electron is ejected. Higher frequency means higher photon energy, explaining the threshold phenomenon. Instantaneous emission arises because energy transfer happens in a single interaction between a photon and an electron.\n\n**(b) Blackbody Radiation Spectrum**\n\n* **Experimental Setup:** A blackbody is an idealized object that absorbs all electromagnetic radiation incident upon it and emits radiation based solely on its temperature. Experiments measure the intensity of radiation emitted at various wavelengths for a given temperature.\n\n* **Non-Classical Observation:** Classical physics predicted that the intensity of emitted radiation should increase indefinitely at shorter wavelengths (ultraviolet catastrophe). However, observations revealed a peak wavelength dependent on temperature and a decrease in intensity at shorter wavelengths.\n\n* **Quantum Explanation:** Max Planck resolved this discrepancy by postulating that the energy of oscillators within the blackbody could only exist in discrete quantized levels:\n\n   $$ E_n = n h \\nu $$\n\nwhere *n* is an integer representing the energy level. This meant that the blackbody couldn't emit arbitrary amounts of energy at any frequency. Instead, the allowed energies were restricted to multiples of *hν*. This led to a theoretical prediction of the blackbody spectrum that matched experimental data remarkably well.\n\n\n\n**In Conclusion:** Both the photoelectric effect and the blackbody radiation spectrum provided compelling evidence for the quantization of energy. These experiments demonstrated that energy doesn't flow continuously but rather comes in discrete packets – quanta. This revolutionary concept laid the foundation for the development of quantum mechanics.\n\n\\[\\boxed{ } \\]\n", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

This process would require inputting energy into the system, accounting for the difference between the initial and final energies.\n\nIn summary, while the exact calculations involve more sophisticated mathematics, the key concepts are understanding the quantization of energy levels in a box, the transition to free particle behavior upon removing confinement, and recognizing the role of external forces in energy changes.\n", "final_answers": ["E_1 = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2ma^2}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "E_1 = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2ma^2}", "expr2": "E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2ma^2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "hbar**2*pi**2/(2*a**2*m)", "expr2": "hbar**2*pi**2/(2*a**2*m)"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "quantum/6034", "solution": "Here's how to compute the total scattering cross-section for this problem:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\n\n* We have two neutrons interacting via a short-range potential that depends on their spins. This means the interaction can be attractive or repulsive depending on the relative orientation of the neutron spins.\n* \"Zero energy\" implies we're dealing with very slow neutrons where kinetic energy is negligible compared to the potential energy from the interaction.\n* Unpolarized neutrons mean they don't have a preferred spin direction.\n\n**2. Scattering Amplitude:**\n\nThe key quantity needed for calculating the cross-section is the scattering amplitude *f*. In quantum mechanics,  the differential cross-section (probability per unit solid angle) is proportional to |*f*|². For low energies, the Born approximation simplifies calculations significantly.\n\n **3. Applying the Born Approximation:**\n\nThe Born approximation states:\n\n $$ f(\\theta) = -\\frac{m}{2\\pi\\hbar^2}\\int e^{i\\mathbf{k}' \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} V(\\mathbf{r}) e^{-i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} d^3r $$\n\nWhere:\n\n* *f*(θ) is the scattering amplitude as a function of the scattering angle θ.\n* *m* is the mass of a neutron.\n* ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n* **k** is the initial wave vector of the incoming neutron.\n* **k'** is the final wave vector of the scattered neutron.\n* *V*(**r**) is the interaction potential.\n\nSince our potential is spherically symmetric, we can simplify the integral using spherical coordinates. Also, due to the zero energy condition, both **k** and **k'** will be small, allowing us to approximate *e^(ik⋅r)* ≈ 1 within the range of the potential.\n\n\n**4. Spin Dependence:**\n\nBecause the potential includes the dot product of Pauli spin matrices, it couples the spin states of the neutrons. To handle this, we need to consider all possible spin configurations of the incoming and outgoing neutrons. Since the neutrons are initially unpolarized, we average over the initial spin states and sum over the final spin states.\n\n**5. Calculating the Cross Section:**\n\nAfter performing the integration and accounting for spin averaging/summation, you would obtain an expression for the scattering amplitude *f*(θ).

Understand the System:**\n\n* We have an electron trapped inside a perfectly spherical, rigid container (the cavity). \n* The electron cannot escape due to the impenetrable walls. This means it behaves like a particle in a three-dimensional box.\n* We need to find the force the electron exerts on the walls, which will allow us to calculate the pressure.\n\n**2. Quantum Mechanics Approach:**\n\nSince the electron is confined, we must use quantum mechanics to describe its behavior.  The allowed energy states of the electron within the sphere are quantized.\n\n**3. Schrödinger Equation:**\n\nWe start with the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a spherically symmetric potential:\n\n```\n(-ħ²/2m)∇²ψ(r, θ, φ) + V(r)ψ(r, θ, φ) = Eψ(r, θ, φ)\n```\n\nwhere:\n\n* ħ is the reduced Planck constant\n* m is the mass of the electron\n* ψ(r, θ, φ) is the wavefunction describing the electron's state\n* V(r) is the potential energy function\n* E is the total energy of the electron\n\n **4. Potential Energy:**\n\nInside the cavity, there is no potential energy (V(r) = 0), as the walls are impenetrable. Outside the cavity, the potential becomes infinite, preventing the electron from escaping.\n\n**5. Solving the Schrödinger Equation:**\n\nSolving the Schrödinger equation for this system involves separation of variables and using spherical coordinates. The solutions are called spherical harmonics and lead to quantized energy levels.\n\n**6. Ground State Solution:**\n\nThe ground state corresponds to the lowest possible energy level. For a particle in a sphere, the ground state has angular momentum l=0 and radial quantum number n=1.\n\n**7. Pressure Calculation:**\n\nPressure is defined as force per unit area. To find the force exerted by the electron on the wall, we can consider the change in momentum of the electron when it collides with the wall. Due to the confinement, the electron bounces back elastically.\n\n* **Momentum Change:** When the electron hits the wall, its momentum changes direction but not magnitude. Therefore, the change in momentum Δp is twice the initial momentum p.\n\n* **Force:** Force is related to the rate of change of momentum: F = Δp/Δt. Since the electron bounces repeatedly off the wall, we can average over many collisions to get a continuous force.\n\n* **Area:** The area over which the force acts is the surface area of the sphere, A = 4πR².\n\n\nPutting these together, we can express the pressure P as:\n\nP = F/A = (Δp/Δt)/A ≈ (2p)/(4πR²Δt)\n\nTo relate this to the electron's energy and properties, recall that the kinetic energy of the electron is given by KE = p²/2m. Using the ground state energy obtained from solving the Schrödinger equation, we can determine the momentum p and ultimately calculate the pressure.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you would like me to work through the detailed calculations involving the specific form of the ground state wavefunction and energy. It involves some more involved mathematics, including integration and normalization conditions. However, the steps outlined above give you the conceptual framework for approaching this problem.\n\nFinally, after performing those calculations, the result for the pressure exerted by the electron in its ground state will be expressed in terms of fundamental constants (ħ, m, R) .

Let's start with one of them as an example:\n\n* **Calculating $[J_x^2, J_y^2]$:**\n\nRecall the definition of the commutator: $[A, B] = AB - BA$. Applying this to our case:\n\n $$[J_x^2, J_y^2] = J_x^2 J_y^2 - J_y^2 J_x^2$$\n\nNow we can expand using the fact that $J_i^2 = J_i \\cdot J_i$:\n\n$$[J_x^2, J_y^2] = (J_x J_x)(J_y J_y) - (J_y J_y)(J_x J_x)$$\n\nUsing the commutation relations for angular momentum operators ($[J_i, J_j]= i\\hbar \\epsilon_{ijk} J_k$), we know how $J_x$, $J_y$, and $J_z$ commute with each other. We will use these relations repeatedly while expanding the products above. The calculation is somewhat tedious but straightforward. After careful expansion and simplification, you will find that:\n\n$$[J_x^2, J_y^2] = i\\hbar (J_x J_y J_z + J_z J_x J_y - J_y J_x J_z - J_z J_y J_x)$$\n\nNotice that the terms on the right-hand side resemble the structure of another commutator: $[J_x J_y, J_z]$. Using the same process, you can calculate $[J_y^2, J_z^2]$ and $[J_z^2, J_x^2]$, and you'll find they have identical forms to the result above.

This means all three commutators vanish trivially when acting on $|0,0\\rangle$.\n\nSimilarly, for $j=1/2$, we have two states, $|1/2, 1/2\\rangle$ and $|1/2,-1/2\\rangle$. You can explicitly calculate the action of the squared angular momentum operators on these states and verify that the commutators vanish.\n\n**(c) Vanishing Commutators and Common Eigenbasis for j=1**\n\nSimilar to part (b), you can directly compute the action of the squared angular momentum operators on the three states corresponding to $j=1$: $|1,1\\rangle$, $|1,0\\rangle$, and $|1,-1\\rangle$.

This means an electron in orbit around an atom would lose energy and spiral into the nucleus, causing the atom to collapse. \n* **Atoms Don't Collapse:**  Obviously, this didn't happen! Atoms were observed to be stable structures. Classical physics couldn't explain why.\n\n**Quantum Mechanics Solves the Stability Issue**\n\n* **Quantized Energy Levels:** Quantum mechanics introduced the revolutionary concept that electrons can only exist in specific, discrete energy levels within an atom. These levels are quantized, meaning they can't take on just any value.\n* **No Continuous Radiation:** Because electrons are restricted to these fixed energy levels, they cannot continuously lose energy through radiation while orbiting. They can only transition between these levels by absorbing or emitting photons with very specific energies corresponding to the difference between those levels.\n\n**After Quantum Mechanics: The Challenge of Stimulated Emission**\n\n* **Spontaneous Emission is Slow:** While quantum mechanics explained stability, it also predicted that excited atoms would eventually spontaneously decay back to lower energy levels, emitting photons in the process. However, this spontaneous emission process was found to be relatively slow.\n* **Need for Controlled Light Emission:** Scientists wanted to develop devices like lasers, which require a controlled and amplified source of light. To achieve this, they needed a way to stimulate atoms to emit light more efficiently and coherently.\n\n**Stimulated Emission: Making Excited Atoms Emit Light Efficiently**\n\n\n* **Einstein's Insight:** Albert Einstein proposed the idea of stimulated emission in 1917. He showed that when an excited atom interacts with a photon whose energy matches the energy difference between its current state and a lower energy level, the atom can be *stimulated* to emit a second identical photon.\n* **Laser Technology:** This principle forms the basis of laser technology. In a laser, a population inversion is created where more atoms are in an excited state than in the ground state. When a stimulating photon enters the system, it triggers a cascade of stimulated emissions, resulting in a highly coherent and intense beam of light.\n\n\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe key factor enabling excited atoms to emit light efficiently is \\[\\boxed{\\text{stimulated emission}}. \\]\n", "final_answers": ["\\text{stimulated emission}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{stimulated emission}", "expr2": "\\text{Mechanism to prevent atoms from emitting light was needed, but not found.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{stimulated emission}", "expr2": "\\text{Quantum Electrodynamics explains spontaneous emission via photon creation operator.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{stimulated emission}", "expr2": "\\text{Interaction with radiation field via single-photon creation operator.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
