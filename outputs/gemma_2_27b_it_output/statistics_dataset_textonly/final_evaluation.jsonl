It represents the energy required to increase the surface area of the liquid by a unit amount. \n* **Heat of Vaporization:** The heat of vaporization is the amount of energy needed to transform one gram of a substance from a liquid to a gas at its boiling point. This process requires overcoming the intermolecular forces holding the liquid together.\n\n**The Relationship:**\n\nThere's a qualitative relationship between surface tension and heat of vaporization.  Liquids with higher heats of vaporization tend to have stronger intermolecular forces, which also contribute to higher surface tension.\n\n**Estimation Using Trouton's Rule:**\n\nTrouton's rule provides a rough estimate for the entropy of vaporization (ΔS<sub>vap</sub>) of many liquids:\n\n ΔS<sub>vap</sub> ≈ 87 J/(mol·K)\n\nWe can use this rule along with the following thermodynamic relationships to connect heat of vaporization to surface tension:\n\n1. **Gibbs Free Energy Change for Phase Transition:**\n\n   ΔG<sub>vap</sub> = ΔH<sub>vap</sub> - TΔS<sub>vap</sub>\n\n   At equilibrium (boiling point), ΔG<sub>vap</sub> = 0.

A simplified approach might assume a proportionality:\n\n    γ ∝ ΔH<sub>vap</sub>\n\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Convert Heat of Vaporization to J/g:**\n\n   10<sup>10</sup> erg/g * (1 J / 10<sup>7</sup> erg) = 10<sup>3</sup> J/g\n\n2. **Estimate Entropy of Vaporization using Trouton's Rule:**\n\n   ΔS<sub>vap</sub> ≈ 87 J/(mol·K)\n\n3. **Calculate Molar Heat of Vaporization:**\n\n   Assume a hypothetical molar mass (M) for the liquid – let's say M = 100 g/mol.

The third law deals with the behavior of entropy *as* temperature approaches absolute zero. It doesn't say anything definitive about what happens *below* absolute zero.\n\nA system with a negative temperature has a peculiar property: its energy increases as heat is removed from it. This seems counterintuitive because we typically associate removing heat with lowering energy. However, this arises due to how temperature is defined statistically for systems with discrete energy levels.\n\nThink of it like this: imagine a group of particles where each particle can only exist in specific energy states. If most particles occupy lower energy states, the system has a positive temperature. But if most particles are \"excited\" to higher energy states, the system might exhibit properties associated with a negative temperature.\n\n**(c) Example of Negative Temperature Achievement**\n\nOne way to achieve negative temperature experimentally involves using nuclear spins in certain materials.

This means there wouldn't be enough energy for molecules to overcome intermolecular forces and exist in a liquid state.  They would be locked into a fixed crystalline structure characteristic of solids.\n\n**(b) The solid phase can exist at temperatures above the critical temperature.**\n\n* **False (F)** The critical temperature is the point beyond which a substance cannot exist as a liquid, no matter how much pressure is applied. Above this temperature, only the gaseous phase exists.\n\n**(c) Oxygen boils at a higher temperature than nitrogen.**\n\n* **True (T)** Oxygen has stronger intermolecular forces than nitrogen due to its larger size and more electrons. Stronger forces require more energy to overcome, resulting in a higher boiling point.\n\n**(d) The maximum inversion temperature of He is less than 20 K.**\n\n* **True (T)** Helium has a very low inversion temperature (-42°C or about 231 K). Inversion temperature refers to the temperature above which Joule-Thomson expansion results in heating rather than cooling.\n\n**(e) γ of a gas is always greater than one.**\n\n* **True (T)** Gamma (γ) represents the adiabatic index, also known as the heat capacity ratio. It's defined as Cp/Cv (specific heat at constant pressure divided by specific heat at constant volume). For ideal gases, γ is always greater than one because Cp is always greater than Cv.\n\n**(f) A compressor will get hotter when compressing a diatomic gas than when compressing a monatomic gas at the same rate.**\n\n* **True (T)** Diatomic gases have additional degrees of freedom associated with rotational motion compared to monatomic gases. During compression, some energy goes into exciting these rotational modes, leading to a higher temperature rise.\n\n**(g) The coefficient of performance of a refrigerator can be greater than one.**\n\n* **True (T)** The coefficient of performance (COP) of a refrigerator measures its efficiency. While it might seem counterintuitive, COP can be greater than one. This doesn't violate the laws of thermodynamics; it reflects that refrigerators move heat from a cold reservoir to a hot reservoir, requiring work input.\n\n**(h) A slightly roughened ball is thrown from north to south. As one looks down from above, the ball is seen to be spinning counterclockwise. The ball is seen to curve toward east.**\n\n* **True (T)** This describes the Magnus effect. The spin of the ball creates a difference in air pressure around it. Higher pressure on one side pushes the ball towards the lower pressure region, causing it to curve. In this case, the counterclockwise spin combined with the northward trajectory causes the ball to curve eastward.\n\n\n\n**Final Answers:**\n\n\\[\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{llllllll}\na & b & c & d & e & f & g & h \\\\\nF & F & T & T & T & T & T & T\n\\end{array}} \\]\n", "final_answers": ["\\begin{array}{llllllll}\na & b & c & d & e & f & g & h \\\\\nF & F & T & T & T & T & T & T\n\\end{array}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{llllllll}\na & b & c & d & e & f & g & h \\\\\nF & F & T & T & T & T & T & T\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "(a) \\, F"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": "I don't understand this\n\\begin{array}{llllllll}\na & b & c & d & e & f & g & h \\\\\nF & F & T & T & T & T & T & T\n\\end{array}\n~~^"}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Bosons do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning multiple bosons can occupy the same quantum state. At typical temperatures and pressures, the interatomic spacing in helium gas is large enough that we can treat the atoms as non-interacting particles. This makes Bose-Einstein statistics suitable for describing their distribution.\n\n**Solution:** To calculate the density, we need to use the Bose-Einstein distribution function and integrate over all possible momenta. However, since this involves complex calculations beyond the scope of a simple explanation, I will only outline the general approach:\n\n1. **Define the system:** We have a system of non-interacting He⁴ atoms at room temperature and pressure.\n\n2. **Apply the Bose-Einstein distribution:** The probability of finding an atom with energy ε is given by:\n\n   $$f(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{e^{(\\epsilon - \\mu)/k_BT} - 1}$$\n\n    where μ is the chemical potential, kB is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.\n\n3. **Integrate over momentum space:** Integrate the distribution function multiplied by the density of states to find the total number of particles per unit volume.\n\n4. **Determine the chemical potential:** Use the constraint that the total number of particles must equal the desired density.\n\n\n\n**(b) Density of electrons in copper at room temperature.**\n\n* **Statistics:** Fermi-Dirac statistics.\n\n* **Explanation:** Electrons are fermions because they have half-integer spin (1/2). Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state. This leads to distinct behavior compared to bosons, especially at low temperatures where the Fermi-Dirac distribution becomes important.\n\n**Solution:** Similar to the previous case, calculating the exact electron density requires integrating the Fermi-Dirac distribution function over all available energy levels within the conduction band of copper. Due to the complexity involved, I won't go into detailed calculations here.\n\n1. **Consider the Fermi-Dirac distribution:** The probability of finding an electron with energy ε is given by:\n\n $$ f(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{e^{(\\epsilon - E_F)/k_BT} + 1}$$\n\n   where EF is the Fermi energy.\n\n2. **Account for the band structure:** Copper has a specific electronic band structure, so you need to consider the allowed energy levels within its conduction band when performing the integration.\n\n3. **Calculate the integral:** Integrate the Fermi-Dirac distribution function over the relevant energy range to obtain the electron density.\n\n\n\n\n**(c) Density of electrons and holes in semiconducting Ge at room temperature (Ge band-gap ≈ 1 volt).**\n\n* **Statistics:** Both Fermi-Dirac statistics apply to both electrons and holes.\n\n* **Explanation:** In semiconductors like germanium, thermal excitation creates both free electrons in the conduction band and \"holes\" (missing electrons) in the valence band.

These subsystems are assumed to be in weak thermal contact, allowing for energy exchange but not particle transfer. They also maintain their own internal thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nThe total entropy change of the isolated system ΔS<sub>total</sub> is the sum of the entropy changes in its subsystems:\n\nΔS<sub>total</sub> = ΔS<sub>B</sub> + ΔS<sub>C</sub>\n\nNow let's analyze how entropy evolves based on energy flow between the subsystems:\n\n* **Case 1: Energy flows from subsystem B to C.** When heat flows spontaneously from a hotter body (B) to a colder one (C), the entropy of the hot body decreases because it loses accessible microstates. However, the entropy of the cold body increases even more due to gaining accessible microstates. The net effect is an increase in the total entropy of the combined system. This aligns with the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of an isolated system always tends to increase over time.\n\n* **Case 2: Subsystems B and C reach thermal equilibrium.** If no further net energy transfer occurs between the subsystems, they have reached thermal equilibrium. At this point, both subsystems have maximized their individual entropies for the given energy distribution. Any attempt to redistribute energy would lead to a decrease in the total entropy, violating the second law.

{"id": "statistics/1-151", "solution": "Here's a breakdown of the answers:\n\n\n**(a) What causes the temperature rise in the stratosphere?**\n\nThe primary cause of the temperature increase in the stratosphere is the absorption of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun by ozone (O3).  Ozone molecules absorb UV light particularly effectively, leading to their excitation and subsequent release of energy as heat. This process warms the surrounding air, resulting in the observed temperature inversion.\n\n**(b) The warm stratosphere completely surrounds the Earth, above the cooler tropopause, maintained as a permanent state. Explain.**\n\nThe stratospheric warming due to ozone absorption creates a stable layer above the troposphere. Here's why this stability persists:\n\n* **Density:** Warmer air is less dense than colder air. In the stratosphere, the warmer temperatures mean lower density compared to the denser, colder air below in the troposphere.\n* **Convection:** Convection currents, driven by differences in density, typically transfer heat upwards. However, because the stratosphere is warmer and less dense than the troposphere beneath it, convection is suppressed. Warm air doesn't readily mix downwards into the troposphere.\n* **Limited Vertical Mixing:** There's relatively little vertical mixing between the troposphere and stratosphere due to the strong temperature gradient and lack of significant convective activity.\n\nThis combination of factors maintains the distinct separation and temperature difference between the troposphere and stratosphere.\n\n**(c) Sound waves emitted by a plane in the tropopause region will travel to great distances at these altitudes, with intensity decreasing, approximately, only as 1/R. Explain.**\n\nSound wave propagation depends on the medium through which they travel. In the troposphere, sound waves experience attenuation (loss of intensity) primarily due to interactions with air molecules and variations in temperature and humidity.\n\nHowever, in the stratosphere:\n\n* **Lower Density:** The lower density of the stratosphere means fewer air molecules for sound waves to interact with, reducing scattering and absorption.\n* **Stable Temperature Profile:** The relatively uniform temperature profile in the stratosphere minimizes refraction and bending of sound waves, allowing them to propagate more directly.\n\nAs a result, sound waves can travel much farther in the stratosphere with less attenuation. The approximate 1/R decrease in intensity suggests that the spreading of the sound wavefront dominates the loss of intensity rather than absorption or scattering within the medium.\n\n\n\n\\[\\boxed{See \\ explanations \\ above}\\]\n", "final_answers": ["See \\ explanations \\ above"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "See \\ explanations \\ above", "expr2": "\\text{The concentration of ozone, which absorbs ultraviolet radiation and raises the temperature.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Since S = f(H/T), increasing H while keeping T constant leads to an increase in entropy.\n\n* **Thermal Isolation:** Thermally isolating the system prevents heat exchange with the surroundings.\n\n* **Adiabatic Demagnetization:** Now, slowly decrease the magnetic field H to zero. Because the process is adiabatic (no heat exchange), the entropy remains constant. However, since S = f(H/T), decreasing H must lead to a decrease in T to keep S constant.\n\nTherefore, adiabatic demagnetization results in cooling.\n\n**Part 3: Limitations at Low Temperatures**\n\nAdiabatic demagnetization is most effective at very low temperatures because:\n\n* **Spin Alignment:** At high temperatures, thermal agitation randomizes the spin orientations. As the temperature decreases, more spins align with the magnetic field, leading to a larger change in entropy when the field is changed.\n\n* **Heat Capacity:** The heat capacity of paramagnetic materials typically decreases rapidly at low temperatures.

This implies that the wavefunctions of individual particles do not overlap significantly. In this case, the indistinguishability of bosons becomes less important, and the system approaches classical behavior.\n\nRecall that the de Broglie wavelength is given by:\n\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2m\\epsilon}}$$\n\nWhen *d >> λ*, the phase space available to each particle is effectively independent of the others.

However, since we are interested only in the first-order difference, we can make some approximations based on the fact that *d >> λ*.\n\nIn this limit, the differences in energy levels due to boson exchange symmetry will be small compared to the overall thermal energy scale. Therefore, we expect ΔE to be relatively small.\n\nA more precise calculation would involve solving for the density of states *g(ε)* for the cubic box and performing the integrations explicitly.\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{See detailed solutions above.}} \\]\n", "final_answers": ["\\text{See detailed solutions above.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{See detailed solutions above.}", "expr2": "n(\\epsilon) = \\frac{2\\pi V (2m)^{3/2}}{h^3} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}}{e^{(\\epsilon-\\mu)/kT} - 1} \\, d\\epsilon"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{See detailed solutions above.}", "expr2": "e^{-\\mu/kT} = \\left(\\frac{d}{\\lambda}\\right)^3"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{See detailed solutions above.}", "expr2": "\\bar{E} = \\frac{3}{2}NkT \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{2}} \\frac{\\lambda^3}{d^3} \\right)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "statistics/2-152", "solution": "Here's a breakdown of why electrons in metals have surprisingly long mean free paths despite their close proximity:\n\n**Reasons for Long Electron-Electron Mean Free Paths:**\n\n1. **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Electrons are fermions, meaning they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This principle states that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.  Because of this, electrons cannot simply \"bump into\" each other like billiard balls. They must scatter into unoccupied energy levels, which becomes less likely as the Fermi sea fills up with electrons.\n\n2. **Screening Effects:** The positive ions in the metallic lattice act to screen the Coulomb repulsion between electrons. While electrons do repel each other electrostatically, these repulsive forces are significantly reduced due to the presence of the positively charged ions.\n\n3. **Fermi Velocity:** Electrons in a metal exist within a range of energies known as the Fermi sea. Their average velocity, called the Fermi velocity, is relatively high. However, because of the Pauli exclusion principle, collisions require significant changes in momentum and energy. These large changes are statistically less probable than small angle scattering events.\n\n**Temperature Dependence:**\n\nAs temperature increases, the following effects contribute to a decrease in the electron-electron mean free path:\n\n* **Increased Thermal Excitations:** Higher temperatures lead to more electrons being excited to higher energy levels within the Fermi sea. This increases the probability of finding available states for scattering, leading to more frequent collisions.\n* **Lattice Vibrations:** Increased thermal energy also causes the atoms in the lattice to vibrate more vigorously. These vibrations create distortions in the potential experienced by electrons, further increasing the likelihood of scattering.\n\n\nTherefore, the electron-electron mean free path generally *decreases* with increasing temperature.\n\n\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\lambda_{ee}(T) \\text{ decreases as } T \\text{ increases}} \\]\n", "final_answers": ["\\lambda_{ee}(T) \\text{ decreases as } T \\text{ increases}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\lambda_{ee}(T) \\text{ decreases as } T \\text{ increases}", "expr2": "\\lambda_{ee} \\propto \\frac{1}{T}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

For a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, the change in entropy is given by:\n\n   ΔS = nR ln(Vf/Vi)\n\n    where:\n     * ΔS is the change in entropy\n     * n is the number of moles\n     * R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K))\n     * Vi is the initial volume\n     * Vf is the final volume\n\n* **Calculation:** In this case, n = 1 mol, Vi = V₁, and Vf = 2V₁. Substituting these values into the equation:\n\n   ΔS = (1 mol)(8.314 J/(mol·K)) ln(2V₁/V₁)\n   ΔS = 8.314 J/K * ln(2)\n\n**(b) Change in Entropy of the Universe**\n\n* **Reversible Processes:** In a reversible process, the system and surroundings exchange heat reversibly. This means there are no dissipative forces like friction, and the total entropy change of the universe is zero.\n\n   Therefore, for a reversible isothermal expansion:\n\n   ΔSuniv = ΔSsystem + ΔSurroundings = 0\n\n\n**Free Expansion:**\n\n**(a) Change in Entropy of the Gas**\n\n* **Adiabatic Process:** Free expansion happens so quickly that there's essentially no heat transfer between the gas and its surroundings (adiabatic process). The work done by or on the gas during free expansion is also zero. Since dQ = 0 and dW = 0, the first law of thermodynamics tells us that ΔU = 0. For an ideal gas, internal energy depends only on temperature, meaning the temperature remains constant during free expansion.\n\n* **Entropy Calculation:** Because the process is adiabatic and isothermal, the change in entropy of the gas is calculated using the same formula as before:\n\n   ΔS = nR ln(Vf/Vi) = (1 mol)(8.314 J/(mol·K)) ln(2V₁/V₁)\n   ΔS = 8.314 J/K * ln(2)\n\n**(b) Change in Entropy of the Universe**\n\n* **Irreversible Process:** Free expansion is an irreversible process because it cannot be reversed without some external intervention.\n\n* **Entropy Increase:** Since the gas expands freely into vacuum, the surroundings do not experience any change in entropy.

{"id": "statistics/2-14", "solution": "Here's a breakdown of the different particle statistics, their connection to indistinguishability, and when classical behavior emerges:\n\n\n**(a) Particle Statistics**\n\n* **Boltzmann Statistics:** This applies to *distinguishable* particles, meaning we can tell them apart even if they are identical in all other respects. These particles don't obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle (no two fermions can occupy the same state). A classic example is a gas of non-interacting ideal gas molecules. The probability of finding a particle in a particular energy state is given by the Boltzmann distribution:\n\n   $$P_i = \\frac{e^{-E_i/k_BT}}{Z}$$\n\n    where:\n     * $P_i$ is the probability of occupying state i\n     * $E_i$ is the energy of state i\n     * $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant\n     * $T$ is the absolute temperature\n     * $Z$ is the partition function, ensuring probabilities sum to 1\n\n* **Fermi-Dirac Statistics:** This governs *indistinguishable* particles called fermions (like electrons, protons, and neutrons). Fermions obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle – only one fermion can occupy a specific quantum state at a time. This leads to phenomena like electron degeneracy pressure that supports white dwarf stars. The average number of fermions in a state is given by:\n\n   $$f(E) = \\frac{1}{e^{(E-\\mu)/k_BT} + 1}$$\n\n    where:\n      * $f(E)$ is the Fermi-Dirac distribution function\n      * $\\mu$ is the chemical potential\n\n* **Bose-Einstein Statistics:** This describes *indistinguishable* particles called bosons (like photons, gluons, and helium-4 atoms). Bosons do *not* obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle; multiple bosons can occupy the same quantum state. This allows for macroscopic occupation of the lowest energy state, leading to phenomena like superfluidity and Bose-Einstein condensation. The average number of bosons in a state is given by:\n\n   $$n(E) = \\frac{1}{e^{(E-\\mu)/k_BT}-1}$$\n\n    where:\n      * $n(E)$ is the Bose-Einstein distribution function\n\n**Indistinguishability:**\n\nThe key difference lies in how we treat the wavefunction describing these particles. For distinguishable particles, the total wavefunction is simply the product of individual wavefunctions. However, for indistinguishable particles, the total wavefunction must either be symmetric (bosons) or antisymmetric (fermions) under exchange of any two particles. This symmetry requirement directly leads to the distinct statistical behaviors.\n\n\n\n**(b) High Temperature Limit**\n\nAs the temperature increases, thermal energy ($k_BT$) becomes much larger than the typical spacing between energy levels. In this regime:\n\n* **All distributions become approximately equal.** The exponential terms dominate, making the distinctions between the denominators less significant. Essentially, particles gain enough energy to overcome the restrictions imposed by quantum statistics. They behave more classically, acting independently and without regard to their inherent bosonic or fermionic nature.\n\n* **\"How high?\"**: There isn't a precise threshold. It depends on the system's characteristics, such as the density of states and the interaction strength between particles. Generally, temperatures significantly higher than the characteristic energy scales of the system lead to classical behavior.\n\n**(c) Neutrons in a Plane**\n\nTo determine when quantum statistics matter for our neutron scenario, we need to compare the thermal de Broglie wavelength ($\\lambda_{dB}$) to the interparticle spacing. If $\\lambda_{dB}$ is comparable to or larger than the interparticle distance, quantum effects are important.\n\n1. **Interparticle Spacing:** With a density of $10^{12}/cm^2$, the average distance between neutrons is roughly $(10^{12} cm^{-2})^{-1/2} \\approx 10^{-6} cm$.\n\n2. **Thermal de Broglie Wavelength:**\n\n   $$\\lambda_{dB} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2m k_BT}}$$\n\n   Where:\n    * $h$ is Planck's constant\n    * $m$ is the mass of a neutron\n    * $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant\n    * $T$ is the temperature\n\n3. **Comparison:** We want to find the temperature where $\\lambda_{dB} \\approx 10^{-6} cm$.

Energy Levels:**\n\nThe energy of a single spin in a magnetic field is given by:\n\n  E = -μ ⋅ B\n\nwhere μ is the magnetic moment vector. For a spin 1/2 particle, the magnitude of the magnetic moment is simply *m*. So, we have two possible energies for each spin:\n\n* E_↑ = -mB (for spin up)\n* E_↓ = +mB (for spin down)\n\n **3. Boltzmann Distribution:**\n\nIn thermal equilibrium, the probability of finding a spin in a particular state is determined by the Boltzmann distribution:\n\n P(state) = (1/Z) * exp(-E_state / kτ)\n\n where:\n    * Z is the partition function, which ensures probabilities sum to 1.\n    * k is Boltzmann's constant.\n    * τ is the absolute temperature.\n\n**4. Calculate Partition Function:**\n\nFor our system, the partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for both states:\n\n Z = exp(-E_↑ / kτ) + exp(-E_↓ / kτ)\n   = exp(mB / kτ) + exp(-mB / kτ)\n\n**5. Average Spin:**\n\nThe average spin, ⟨s⟩, is calculated as the weighted average of the spin values:\n\n ⟨s⟩ = (1/2) * [(+1/2) * P(↑) + (-1/2) * P(↓)]\n\nSubstitute the probabilities from the Boltzmann distribution and simplify. You'll get an expression involving the partition function.\n\n**6. Fractional Magnetization:**\n\nFinally, calculate the fractional magnetization:\n\nM/Nm = 2⟨s⟩/N\n\n\n**7. Final Answer:**\n\nAfter substituting the expressions for ⟨s⟩ and simplifying, you will arrive at the final answer for the equilibrium value of the fractional magnetization.

In other words, the fluctuations in energy around the average value are tiny.\n\nTherefore, while technically the energy of any system in thermal equilibrium fluctuates, these fluctuations are negligible for macroscopic systems.

{"id": "statistics/2-154", "solution": "Here's a breakdown of how to approach this problem:\n\n\n**(a) Diameter D and Steady State**\n\nThe diameter *D* determines whether the flow of helium through the hole is dominated by **molecular effusion** or **viscous flow**.\n\n* **Molecular Effusion:** When *D* is much smaller than the mean free path (the average distance a molecule travels before colliding with another), molecules will pass through the hole individually without significant collisions. This leads to a pressure difference across the hole until equilibrium is established.\n\n* **Viscous Flow:**  When *D* is much larger than the mean free path, many collisions occur within the hole itself. The gas behaves more like a fluid, and its flow is governed by viscosity rather than individual molecular motion. In this case, the pressure difference drives the flow until it reaches a balance determined by viscous forces.\n\n**(b) Ratio of Mean Free Paths for D << l₁, D << l₂**\n\nIn this scenario, we have **molecular effusion**. Since the mean free path is much larger than the hole diameter, the gas molecules essentially \"see\" the hole as a point-like opening.\n\nThe rate of effusion depends on the number density of molecules and their average speed, both of which are related to temperature. Higher temperatures lead to higher speeds and lower densities due to thermal expansion.\n\nSince the system reaches a steady state, the rates of effusion from each side must be equal. Let's denote the pressures on either side as P₁ and P₂, and use Graham's Law of Effusion:\n\nRate₁ / Rate₂ = √(M₂/M₁) = √(T₂/T₁)\n\nwhere M represents molar mass (which is constant for helium).\n\nAt steady state, the pressures will adjust such that the effusion rates are balanced. We can relate pressure, temperature, and density using the ideal gas law: PV=nRT. Assuming similar volumes on both sides, we get:\n\nP₁/P₂ = n₁/n₂ = ρ₁/ρ₂ = T₁/T₂\n\nTherefore, the ratio of mean free paths is inversely proportional to the square root of the temperature ratio:\n\nl₁/l₂ = (k<sub>B</sub>T₁)/(√2 π d² P₁) / [(k<sub>B</sub>T₂)/(√2 π d² P₂)] = (T₁/T₂) (P₂/P₁) = (T₁/T₂)<sup>2</sup> = (150 K / 300 K)² = ¼\n\n\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{l_1}{l_2}=\\frac{1}{4}} \\]\n\n**(c) Ratio of Mean Free Paths for D >> l₁, D >> l₂**\n\nIn this case, we have **viscous flow**. The large hole size means that the details of the molecular interactions near the hole become less important. Instead, the flow is primarily driven by the pressure gradient between the two compartments.\n\nBecause the system reaches a steady state, the pressure difference driving the flow becomes negligible. Therefore, the pressures on both sides will be nearly equal (P₁ ≈ P₂).\n\nUnder these conditions, the mean free path ratio simplifies significantly because the pressure terms cancel out:\n\nl₁/l₂ = (k<sub>B</sub>T₁)/(√2 π d² P₁) / [(k<sub>B</sub>T₂)/(√2 π d² P₂)] ≈ (T₁/T₂) = (150 K / 300 K) = ½\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{l_1}{l_2}=\\frac{1}{2}} \\]\n", "final_answers": ["\\frac{l_1}{l_2}=\\frac{1}{4}", "\\frac{l_1}{l_2}=\\frac{1}{2}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{l_1}{l_2}=\\frac{1}{4}", "expr2": "\\text{If } D \\gg l_1 \\text{ and } D \\gg l_2, \\text{ molecules are exchanged by macroscopic gas flow.

However, this doesn't mean the process isn't useful; it simply means all the heat input is used to drive the phase transition.\n\n* **Step 3: Consider Small Changes**\n\nWe need to consider the small changes Δp and ΔT to get a non-zero efficiency. In reality, these changes allow for some work output even though the overall enthalpy change due to evaporation remains constant.\n\nLet's analyze each stage considering these small changes:\n\n    * **Stage 1→2:** During isothermal expansion, the system absorbs heat Q₁₂ = nLv₀ while expanding against a slightly increasing external pressure.\n\n    * **Stage 2→3:** During adiabatic cooling, the temperature drops by ΔT, causing the pressure to decrease.\n\n    * **Stage 3→4:** During isothermal compression, the system releases heat Q₃₄ = -nLv₀ while being compressed under decreasing external pressure.\n\n    * **Stage 4→1:** During adiabatic heating, the temperature rises back to its initial value, and the pressure increases.\n\n* **Step 4: Apply First Law of Thermodynamics**\n\nFor each stage, apply the first law of thermodynamics: ΔU = Q - W.

The boiling point of water is defined at standard atmospheric pressure. Inside the bottle, there's still air trapped above the water surface. This air acts as a barrier, preventing the water molecules from escaping easily into the gaseous phase. Since the pressure inside the bottle remains lower than the atmospheric pressure outside, the water won't reach its boiling point.\n\n**(b) Why does boiling eventually cease in a sealed bottle?**\n\n* Boiling will eventually cease because the heat source (the initial boiling water) is removed, and the system becomes isolated.\n\n* **Explanation:** When the bottle is sealed, no more energy can enter the system. As the water boils, it absorbs heat energy and converts into steam. This process consumes the available thermal energy within the closed system.

Define States and Probabilities:**\n\n* **State 1 (Empty):** Both adsorption sites on the special molecule are empty.\n* **State 2 (One Site Full - High Energy):** One site is occupied by a gas particle with binding energy  $-\\epsilon_0$.\n* **State 3 (One Site Full - Low Energy):** One site is occupied by a gas particle with binding energy $-\\epsilon_0/2$.\n* **State 4 (Both Sites Full):** Both sites are occupied. We won't need to consider this state explicitly since we want the probability of *exactly one* site being filled.\n\nLet $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$ represent the probabilities of finding a special molecule in each respective state.\n\n**2. Boltzmann Distribution:**\n\nThe probability of a system being in a particular state is given by the Boltzmann distribution:\n\n$$ P_i = \\frac{e^{-E_i / kT}}{Z} $$\n\nwhere:\n\n* $E_i$ is the energy of state $i$\n* $k$ is Boltzmann's constant\n* $T$ is the absolute temperature\n* $Z$ is the partition function, ensuring normalization ($P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$)\n\n**3. Calculate Energies:**\n\n* $E_1 = 0$ (both sites empty)\n* $E_2 = -\\epsilon_0$ (one site filled with high energy)\n* $E_3 = -\\epsilon_0/2$ (one site filled with low energy)\n\n**4. Partition Function:**\n\nThe partition function sums over all possible states:\n\n$$ Z = e^{0/kT} + e^{-\\epsilon_0/kT} + e^{-\\epsilon_0/(2kT)} $$\n\n**5. Probability of Exactly One Site Filled:**\n\nWe want the sum of probabilities for State 2 and State 3:\n\n$$ P_{one\\_site} = P_2 + P_3 = \\frac{e^{-\\epsilon_0/kT}}{Z} + \\frac{e^{-\\epsilon_0/(2kT)}}{Z}$$\n\n**6. Simplify Expression:**\n\n\nSubstitute the expression for $Z$:\n\n$$ P_{one\\_site} = \\frac{e^{-\\epsilon_0/kT} + e^{-\\epsilon_0/(2kT)}}{e^{0/kT} + e^{-\\epsilon_0/kT} + e^{-\\epsilon_0/(2kT)}} $$\n\n\n\n\\[\\boxed{P_{one\\_site} = \\frac{e^{-\\epsilon_0/kT} + e^{-\\epsilon_0/(2kT)}}{1 + e^{-\\epsilon_0/kT} + e^{-\\epsilon_0/(2kT)}}} \\]", "final_answers": ["P_{one\\_site} = \\frac{e^{-\\epsilon_0/kT} + e^{-\\epsilon_0/(2kT)}}{1 + e^{-\\epsilon_0/kT} + e^{-\\epsilon_0/(2kT)}}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "P_{one\\_site} = \\frac{e^{-\\epsilon_0/kT} + e^{-\\epsilon_0/(2kT)}}{1 + e^{-\\epsilon_0/kT} + e^{-\\epsilon_0/(2kT)}}", "expr2": "P_{2}^{1} = \\frac{2p_0 p \\left(1 + e^{-\\epsilon_0 / (2 \\tau)}\\right)}{\\left[p_0 + p \\left(1 + e^{-\\epsilon_0 / \\tau}\\right)\\right]^2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "1/(e**(epsilon/(2*T*k)) + e**(epsilon/(T*k)) + 1) + 1/(e**(epsilon/(2*T*k)) + 1 + e**(-epsilon/(2*T*k)))", "expr2": "2*p*p(1 + e**(-epsilon/(2*tau)))/(p**2 + 2*p*p(1 + e**(-epsilon/tau)) + p(1 + e**(-epsilon/tau))**2)"}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
