This means that the distance between the object and the optical center of the lens should be within 100 cm for sharp images and within 300 cm for模糊 images. Let's assume the man has a normal lens without any curvature.\n\nSince the man is focusing objects at a distance greater than the critical distance, we know that the lens will have positive power ($f > 0$). The further away the object is, the smaller the angle of view and the longer the focal length. Therefore, the focal length of the lens at the far point (focalled at 300 cm) will be $\\frac{1}{do}$.\n\nTo find $do$, we can look at the first surface of the lens when the object is at infinity (i.e., beyond the lens). In this case, the object forms a virtual and upright image on the screen behind the lens. Using the thin lens equation, we get:\n$$1/f = 1/d_o - 1/d_i$$\nwhere $d_o$ is the distance between the object and the optical center of the lens and $d_i$ is the distance between the image and the optical center of the lens. Since the object is infinitely far away, $d_o = \\infty$. Hence, the equation simplifies to:\n$$1/f = 1/d_i$$\nSolving for $d_i$, we find:\n$$d_i = f$$\nSo, the distance between the image and the optical center of the lens is equal to the focal length of the lens.

{"id": "optics/3-19", "solution": " The physical principles involved in these phenomena can be explained as follows:\n\n(a) Blue Sky:\nThe blue sky appears blue because of the scattering of light by the atmosphere. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen and oxygen.

As the sun begins to set, the light that has been Scattered by the atmosphere needs to pass through more of the gas molecules before reaching the observer's eyes.

This creates a flow of electrons, known as current, which can be measured and converted into a signal that can be processed and displayed.\n\nIn order for a photomultiplier tube to function properly, it must have a high number of photodiodes packed closely together so that they can efficiently convert all of the photons that pass through them into electricity.

Since thethickness of the lens is small compared to its diameter, we can approximate that it is flat and homogeneous throughout. This allows us to use the formula for the index of refraction of a uniform medium:\n\n$$n(r) = n_1 + n_2 r^2 + n_3 r^4 + \\cdots$$\n\nwhere $n_1, n_2, n_3,$ etc. are the indices of refraction at the center and at various points along the lens. We want to find the radial variation of the index of refraction, so we need to sum over all terms up to the second order term. The first-order term corresponds to the bulk refractive index of the lens, while the higher-order terms represent the effect of the impurities on the index of refraction.\n\nTo simplify our calculation, let's assume that the impurities are randomly distributed throughout the lens. In this case, each impurity contributes a small addendum to the index of refraction, which can be modeled using the effective index formula:\n\n$$\\Delta n(r) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} d_i \\left(\\frac{n_i - n}{n_0}\\right)$$\n\nwhere $d_i$ is the distance from the center of the lens to the $i$-th impurity, $n_i$ is the index of refraction at the $i$-th impurity, $n_0$ is the average index of refraction (which is equal to thebulk refractive index), and $N$ is the total number of impurities.\n\nSince the impurities are randomly distributed, we can assume that $d_i$ is uniformly random between 0 and $a/2$. Also, since we are only interested in the radial variation of the index of refraction, we can ignore any terms involving fourth powers or higher powers of $r$.\n\nThus, the radial variation of the index of refraction can be expressed as:\n\n$$\\delta n(r) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} d_i \\left(\\frac{n_i - n}{n_0}\\right)$$\n\nSubstituting the given values, we have:\n\n$$\\delta n(r) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{d_i (n_i - n)}{n_0}$$\n\nWe know that the effective index is proportional to the fractional change in the index of refraction across the impurities.

Since the distance traveled by each wave is proportional to its frequency (k = ω/λ), we can try to find the smallest possible value of d by setting it equal to the negative of the frequency associated with the lowest-frequency component of the spectrum.\n\nThe low-frequency component of the spectrum corresponds to long wavelengths, so we can assume that the frequency is close to the maximum possible value for visible light (大约 3 × 10^8 Hz). Therefore, we can write:\n\nd = -f = -c/λ,where c is the speed of light in vacuum (approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s).\n\nSubstituting this into our expression for Δ, we get:\n\nΔ = 2 × 10^-2 nm = 2 × 10^-2 nm\\* (3 × 10^8 m/s)/(500 nm) = 6 × 10^-9 m.\n\nNow we can calculate the corresponding path difference for the maximum intensity of the fringe pattern, which occurs at the center of the line:\n\ny(0) = A \\* exp(-4πi \\* d / λ) \\* cos(k \\* 0 + φ) = A \\* exp(-4πi \\* 6 × 10^-9 m / 500 nm) \\* cos(0 + φ) = A \\* exp(-4πi \\* 6 × 10^-9 m / 0.5 mm) = A \\* exp(-4πi \\* 1.2 × 10^-7 rad) = ...\n\nAs a result, we obtain a complex exponential function representing the amplitude of the fringe pattern at the center of the line. However, this is not the final answer since we are interested in finding the path difference for which the fringe pattern is clearly visible.\n\nInstead, we should focus on the visibility of the interference pattern. Visibility occurs when the distance between adjacent maxima is larger than the width of the spectral line. Therefore, we can express the condition for visibility as follows:\n\nΔ > Δmax,where Δmax is the maximum possible path difference for clear visibility.\n\nSolving for Δmax, we get:\n\nΔmax = 2 × 10^-2 nm = 2 × 10^-2 nm\\* (3 × 10^8 m/s)/(500 nm) = 6 × 10^-9 m.\n\nTherefore, the largest path difference for which interference frangles produced by this light are clearly visible is approximately $\\boxed{6 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m}}$ or 600 pm.", "final_answers": ["6 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "6 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m}", "expr2": "3 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{cm}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "optics/2-86", "solution": "\n To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of birefringence and the formula for the angle of rotation. Birefringence is the phenomenon where two waves of different frequencies travel through the same medium and produce a separation in their phases, resulting in a change in the direction of propagation. In other words, it's the difference between the speed of波的传播 in different media.\n\nIn the case of circularly polarized light, there are two types of waves: right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) and left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP). When RHCP light passes through a crystal with a higher折射 index $n_R$ than its own, the wavevector of the light will experience a phase shift, causing the component of the light polarized along the direction of wavevector to rotate while the component polarized along perpendicular to the direction of wavevector remains unrotated. This results in a rotation of the plane of polarization of the light.\n\nSimilarly, when LHCP light passes through a crystal with a lower折射 index $n_L$, the wavevector of the light experiences a phase shift due to the difference in the speeds of light in the two media. However, since the component of the light polarized along the direction of wavevector is already aligned with the direction of wavevector, no additional rotation occurs. Thus, only the component polarized along the perpendicular direction experiences a phase shift and rotation.\n\nTherefore, the phenomenon described above is called birefringence.\n\nNow let's derive an expression for the angle $\\phi$ by which the plane of polarization of light of frequency $\\omega$ is rotated in passing through a thickness $d$ of the material. We can use the following equation:\n\n$$\\frac{\\Delta}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{2n_L - n_R}{n_L + n_R}$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta$ represents the angle of rotation and $\\Delta x$ represents the path length difference between the two media. Since the angle of incidence is constant, we have:\n\n$$\\cos(\\Delta) = \\frac{n_L - n_R}{n_L + n_R}$$\n\nSolving for $\\Delta$, we get:\n\n$$\\Delta = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{n_L - n_R}{n_L + n_R}\\right)$$\n\nSubstituting the value of $\\Delta$ into the first equation, we get:\n\n$$\\sin(\\Delta) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{n_L - n_R}{n_L + n_R}\\right)^2}$$\n\nThus, the angle of rotation $\\phi$ is given by:\n\n$$\\phi = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{n_L - n_R}{n_L + n_R}\\right)^2}\\right)$$\n\nThis expression relates the angle of rotation to the indices of refraction $n_R$ and $n_L$.", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

In this case, the component of the elliptically polarized beam parallel to the $x$-axis will experience no内部 reflection since it is fully contained within the first medium. On the other hand, the component perpendicular to the $x$-axis will undergo total internal reflection if the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle. The critical angle can be calculated using Snell's law:\n\n$$n_1 sin(\\theta_c) = n_2 sin(\\theta)$$\n\nwhere $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indices of the first and second media, respectively, and $\\theta_c$ is the critical angle.

In both cases (a) and (b), the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of refraction when light travels from air to glass or water, respectively. This occurs because the mediums have different indices of refraction. We will first consider the situation with an opaque circular disk. Let $O$ be the center of the disk, and let $A$ be any point on its surface. The angle of incidence is given by the dot product between the direction vector of the incident light and the normal vector to the disk: $$\\theta = \\frac{\\lambda}{2}$$ where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light. Since the disk is opaque, there is no additional reflection or transmission of light, so the intensity of the light decreases as it moves away from the disk. Thus, the intensity of the light at a distance $L$ behind the disk is given by: $$I(\\text{behind disk}) = I_0 \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi L}{\\lambda}\\right)$$ Next, we consider the situation with an opaque screen with a circular hole. Let $C$ be the center of the screen, and let $B$ be any point on its surface that lies inside the hole. Again, the angle of incidence is given by the dot product between the direction vector of the incident light and the normal vector to the screen: $$\\theta = \\frac{\\lambda}{2}$$ As before, there is no additional reflection or transmission of light outside the hole, so the intensity of the light decreases as it moves away from the hole.

{"id": "optics/2-31", "solution": "\n To solve this problem, we can use the principles of wave interference and geometric optics. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n(a) First, let's find the radius $r_a$ of the hole for the first maximum.\n\nWhen the light passes through the circular hole, it forms complete constructive interferences between consecutive waves passing through the center of the circle and two points on the circumference of the circle that are spaced apart by the diameter. This results in maxima at these points.\n\nThe distance between adjacent maxima is equal to the wavelength of the light multiplied by the number of bright frises (or bright spots) formed by the interference pattern inside the circle. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$2\\pi r_a = m\\lambda$$\nwhere $m$ is the order of the maximum, $r_a$ is the radius of the hole for the first maximum, $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light, and $m$ is an integer representing the position of the maximum on the circumference of the circle.\n\nSince the intensity oscillates with increasing $r$, the wavelength of the light must also be changing. We know that the frequency remains constant, so the period of the oscillation is given by:\n\n$$T=\\frac{\\lambda}{2}$$\n\nFrom the equation $2\\pi r_a = m\\lambda$, we can express $\\lambda$ as:\n\n$$\\lambda= \\frac{2\\pi r_a}{m}$$\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $T$, we get:\n\n$$T=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{m}} = \\frac{1}{\\omega}$$\n\nwhere $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillation, which is related to the speed of light $c$ by:\n\n$$\\omega = c/(\\lambda)$$\n\nSolving for $r_a$, we obtain:\n\n$$r_a = \\frac{m}{2\\omega} = \\frac{m^2}{4\\pi cm}$$\n\nTherefore, the radius $r_a$ of the hole for the first maximum is given by:\n\n$$\\boxed{r_a = \\frac{m^2}{4\\pi cm}}$$\n\n(b) Now, let's find the radius $r_b$ of the hole for the first minimum.\n\nFor the first minimum, there will be minima at the points where the paths of the light intersect the line connecting the centers of the two circles defined by the parameters $r$ and $r+L$. These minima occur when the path of each light ray is along the same arc length as the corresponding bright spot on the previous minimum.\n\nThe distance between adjacent minima is equal to the sum of the distances traveled by the light rays in the two arcs subtended by the angle $\\theta$ at the center of the circle. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$2\\pi r_b = 2L\\sin(\\theta)$$\nwhere $r_b$ is the radius of the hole for the first minimum, $L$ is the distance between the centers of the two circles, $\\theta$ is the angle between the lines connecting the centers and the point of intersection of the two arcs, and $2L\\sin(\\theta)$ is the total distance traveled by the light rays in both arcs.\n\nWe know that the intensity oscillates with increasing $r$, so the distance between adjacent minima should be less than the distance between adjacent maxima. Hence, we have:\n\n$$2\\pi r_b < 2\\pi r_a$$\nwhich implies:\n\n$$r_b < r_a$$\n\nThus, the radius $r_b$ of the hole for the first minimum is smaller than the radius $r_a$ of the hole for the first maximum.\n\n(c) Finally, let's find the ratio of the intensity for $r = r_a$ to the intensity for $r = r_\\infty$.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the intensity oscillates with increasing $r$. At $r = r_a$, the intensity is maximized, while at $r = r_\\infty$, the intensity approaches zero due to the decreasing size of the circular hole. Thus, the ratio of the intensity for $r = r_a$ to the intensity for $r = r_\\infty$ is:\n\n$$\\frac{I(r_a)}{I(r_\\infty)} = \\frac{E(r_a)}{E(r_\\infty)}$$\nwhere $I(r)$ and $E(r)$ are the intensity of the incident light at radii $r$ and $r_\\infty$, respectively.\n\nUsing the formula for the intensity of diffracted X-rays, we have:\n\n$$I(r) = E(r)\\cos^2(\\theta)$$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between the direction of the incident light and the normal to the screen. Since the screen is opaque, all incoming light is absorbed, so $I(r) = 0$ for $r > r_\\infty$.\n\nHence, the ratio becomes:\n\n$$\\frac{I(r_a)}{I(r_\\infty)} = \\frac{E(r_a)}{\\lim_{r \\to \\infty} E(r)}$$\n\nUsing the fact that the energy of a plane wave is proportional to its amplitude and frequency, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{I(r_a)}{I(r_\\infty)} = \\frac{E(r_a)}{E(\\infty)} = \\frac{\\cos^2(\\theta_a)}{\\cos^2(\\theta_\\infty)}$$\n\nwhere $\\theta_a$ and $\\theta_\\infty$ are the angles of diffraction for $r = r_a$ and $r = r_\\infty$, respectively.\n\nNow, using the condition that the intensity oscillates with increasing $r$, we have:\n\n$$\\cos^2(\\theta_a) = \\cos^2(\\theta_\\infty) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the intensity for $r = r_a$ to the intensity for $r = r_\\infty$ is:\n\n$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$\n\n(d) If the screen is replaced by one opaque disk of radius $r_a$, the intensity would still follow the same pattern. The only difference is that now the source of the incident light is a disk instead of a circular hole.\n\nGiven that the intensity oscillates with increasing $r$, the disk would produce maxima and minima at intervals of $L$. The distance between adjacent maxima or minima would then be $2L$.\n\nThe intensity of the diffracted X-rays can be calculated using the same formula as before:\n\n$$I(r) = E(r)\\cos^2(\\theta)$$\n\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between the direction of the incident light and the normal to the disk. Again, since the disk is opaque, all incoming light is absorbed, so $I(r) = 0$ for $r > r_a$.\n\nThe energy of the incident X-rays would depend on the properties of the X-ray source and the incident angle.

{"id": "optics/3-7", "solution": "\n To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n(a) Determine the relation of $f'/f$ to $\\theta$.\nThe conservation of energy and momentum must be applied in order to determine the relationship between $f'$ and $\\theta$. The Conservation of Energy states that the initial kinetic energy of the electron plus the initial potential energy of the electron equals the final kinetic energy of the electron. Similarly, the Conservation of Momentum states that the initial momentum of the electron plus the initial recoil momentum of the electron equals the final momentum of the electron.\n\nFor the given problem, the initial kinetic energy of the electron is $k_i = mv^2/2$, where $m$ is the electron mass and $v$ is the velocity of the electron. The initial potential energy of the electron is zero since it is in the ground state. The final kinetic energy of the electron is $k_f = (mv^2)/2 - f\\cos(\\theta)$, where $f$ is the frequency of the incident photon and $\\theta$ is the angle of scattering. The final momentum of the electron is $p_f = mv^2/2 - f\\sin(\\theta)$. The initial recoil momentum of the electron is $-mv^2/2$.\n\nSince the conservation of momentum holds, we have $p_f + p_i = p_o$, where $p_o$ is the final momentum of the observed electron. Substituting the expressions for $p_f$ and $p_i$, we get $(mv^2)/2 - f\\sin(\\theta) - mv^2/2 = mv^2/2 - f\\cos(\\theta)$. Simplifying gives $f\\cos(\\theta) = f\\sin(\\theta)$ or $\\tan(\\theta) = 1$. Since $\\theta$ cannot equal $45^\\circ$, we can conclude that $\\theta = 0^\\circ$ or $\\theta = 180^\\circ$. However, since the angle of scattering is negative, we know that $\\theta = 180^\\circ$. Therefore, $f'\\/f = -\\cos(180^\\circ/\\theta) = -\\cos(180^\\circ/0^\\circ) = \\boxed{-1}$.\n\n(b) Determine the total electron energy in terms of $f$, $f'$, and the electron mass $m$.\nUsing the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E = \\sqrt{(pc)^2+(mc^2)^2}$, where $E$ is the total energy, $p$ is the momentum, and $c$ is the speed of light. We can express the initial energy of the electron as $E_i = k_i = mv^2/(2E_0)$, where $E_0$ is some reference energy. The final energy of the electron can be expressed as $E_f = E_i - f\\cos(\\theta) = mv^2/(2E_0) - f\\cos(\\theta)$. The recoil energy of the electron is $E_{\\text{recoil}} = mv^2/(2E_0) + f\\sin(\\theta)$. Thus, the total energy of the electron in its scattered state is $E_f + E_{\\text{recoil}}$. Substituting the values obtained above, we get $$E_f + E_{\\text{recoil}} = [mv^2/(2E_0)] - f\\cos(\\theta) + [mv^2/(2E_0)] + f\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{m}{2}(v^2 + 2f\\sin(\\theta)).$$Substituting $\\theta=180^\\circ$ into this equation yields $E_f + E_{\\text{recoil}} = \\frac{m}{2}(v^2 - 2f)$.\n\nTherefore, the total electron energy in terms of $f$, $f'$, and the electron mass $m$ is $$\\boxed{\\frac{m}{2}(v^2 - 2f)}.$$\n\n(c) If the photon energy loss would be 0.2 of the rest energy of the electron, what would be the speed of the scattered electron?\nIf the photon energy loss would be 0.2 of the rest energy of the electron, then the final energy of the electron would be $0.8$ times the rest energy of the electron. Using the expression derived above, we can write this as $0.8\\cdot\\frac{m}{2}(v^2 - 2f)$. Setting this equal to $0.2\\cdot E_i = 0.2\\cdot\\frac{m}{2}(2E_0)$, we obtain $v^2 - 2f = 0.2\\cdot\\frac{m}{2}(2E_0)/0.8$. Solving for $v^2$, we find $v^2 = \\frac{0.2\\cdot\\frac{m}{2}(2E_0)}{0.8} + 2f$. Taking the square root of both sides and using the fact that $v = \\sqrt{2E_0/c^2}$, we obtain $$v = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.2\\cdot\\frac{m}{2}(2E_0)}{0.8} + 2f}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{2E_0}}{c}.$$Simplifying the numerator on the right side gives $v^2 = \\frac{0.2\\cdot\\frac{m}{2}(2E_0)}{0.8} + 2f$. Substituting this back into the expression for $v$ yields $$v = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{0.2\\cdot\\frac{m}{2}(2E_0)}{0.8} + 2f\\right)\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{2E_0}}{c}}.$$Multiplying through by $c$ and simplifying yields $$cv = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.2\\cdot\\frac{m}{2}(2E_0)}{0.8} + 2fc^2f}.$$Finally, dividing both sides by $cv$ yields $$1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.2\\cdot\\frac{m}{2}(2E_0)}{0.8} + 2fc^2f}/ cv.$$Squaring both sides and rearranging gives $$cv^2 = \\sqrt{2\\cdot 0.2\\cdot\\frac{m}{2}(2E_0)(2fc^2f)/0.8} = \\sqrt{2\\cdot 0.2\\cdot\\frac{m}{2}(2E_0)(2fc^2f)/0.8} = \\sqrt{2\\cdot 0.2\\cdot\\frac{m}{2}(2E_0)(2fc^2f)/0.8} = \\sqrt{2\\cdot 0.2\\cdot\\frac{m}{2}(2E_0)(2fc^2f)/0.8} = \\sqrt{2\\cdot 0.2\\cdot\\frac{m}{2}(2E_0)(2fc^2f)/0.8} = \\sqrt{2\\cdot 0.2\\cdot\\frac{m}{2}(2E_0)(2fc^2f)/0.8} = \\sqrt{2\\cdot 0.2\\cdot\\frac{m}{2}(2E_0)(2fc^2f)/0.8} = \\sqrt{2\\cdot 0.2\\cdot\\frac{m}{2}(2E_0)(2fc^2f)/0.8} = \\sqrt{2\\cdot 0.2\\cdot\\frac{m}{2}(2E_0)(2fc^2f)/0.8} = \\sqrt{2\\cdot 0.2\\cdot\\frac{m}{2}(2E_0)(2fc^2f)/0.8} = \\sqrt{2\\cdot 0.2\\cdot\\frac{m}{2}(2E_0", "final_answers": ["-1", "\\frac{m}{2}(v^2 - 2f)"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "-1", "expr2": "\\tan \\theta = \\frac{f'}{f}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "-1", "expr2": "f'/f"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "-1", "expr2": "E = \\sqrt{m^2 c^4 + (f^2 + f'^2) h^2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "-1", "expr2": "sqrt(c**4*m**2 + f**2*h**2 + f'**2*h**2)"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "-1", "expr2": "v = 0.53 \\, c"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "-1", "expr2": "0.53*c"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "-1", "expr2": "E' = \\frac{E - p_0 u \\cos \\theta}{\\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "-1", "expr2": "(E - p*u*cos(theta))/sqrt(1 - u**2/c**2)"}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{m}{2}(v^2 - 2f)", "expr2": "\\tan \\theta = \\frac{f'}{f}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "m*(-2*f + v**2)/2", "expr2": "f'/f"}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{m}{2}(v^2 - 2f)", "expr2": "E = \\sqrt{m^2 c^4 + (f^2 + f'^2) h^2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "m*(-2*f + v**2)/2", "expr2": "sqrt(c**4*m**2 + f**2*h**2 + f'**2*h**2)"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{m}{2}(v^2 - 2f)", "expr2": "v = 0.53 \\, c"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "m*(-2*f + v**2)/2", "expr2": "0.53*c"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{m}{2}(v^2 - 2f)", "expr2": "E' = \\frac{E - p_0 u \\cos \\theta}{\\sqrt{1 - u^2/c^2}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "m*(-2*f + v**2)/2", "expr2": "(E - p*u*cos(theta))/sqrt(1 - u**2/c**2)"}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
