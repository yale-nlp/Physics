For an electron, however, it is not directly applicable since电子的质量非常小 compared to the Planck's constant h divided by 2π times the radius of the orbit. Therefore, we cannot use the standard form of the uncertainty principle. Instead, we can use the de Broglie-Bohm theory, which provides us with the relationship between the position and momentum of a particle as well as the wave function.\n\nThe de Broglie-Bohm equation for the wave function $\\psi$ is given by:\n\\[i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\psi = H\\psi + V\\psi.\\]\nwhere $i$ is the imaginary unit, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $t$ is time, $H$ is the Hamiltonian operator, and $V$ is the势能。\n\nFor the case of an electron in a spherical potential $V=kr$, the Hamiltonian operator is given by:\n\\[H = -\\frac{1}{2}k^2\\nabla^2 - k\\int r dr = -\\frac{1}{2}k^2(\\frac{l_2^2}{r^2} + 1).\\]\nwhere $l_2$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number.

Thus, we have:\n\\[H = -\\frac{1}{2}k^2\\left(\\frac{l_2^2}{r^2} + 1\\right).\\]\nTo find the ground state energy, we need to set the time derivative of the wave function equal to zero and solve for the corresponding values of the angular momentum quantum numbers that minimize the potential energy.

In this case, we can express the energy of the electron in terms of its frequency, which is related to its wavelength by the equation $k = \\frac{h}{\\lambda}$.

Now let us express the wavefunction in terms of spherical coordinates:\n\nψ(r,θ,φ)=(ARejsinθ)/sin⁡θ\n\nNow using the fact that the wavefunction is rotationalyinvariant, we can rotate it by an angle φ such that the new wavevector k'=k\\*cosφ-q\\*sinφ has the same magnitude but opposite direction. Then the wavefunction becomes\n\nψ'(r',θ',φ')=A'REjsin⁡θ'\n\nwhere A' = A*cosφ and R = cosφ/sinφ\n\nThe scattering amplitude is given by the square integral over the space density of the scattered particles\n\nf(θ,φ)=∫∫∫ψ'r'dr'dθ'dφ' |Reej(k'-k)|dO\n\nwhere dO denotes the solid angle subtended by the scattered particles at the center of interaction.

Hence the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) is independent of φ.\n\n(b) As mentioned above, the argument provided in part (a) shows that if the entire Hamiltonian is rotationalyinvariant, then the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) is independent of φ. However, this does not mean that the same argument cannot be applied to conclusion that f(θ) is independent of θ either. For example, if the potential V(x) is also rotationalyinvariant, then the same argument would apply. But if the potential is not rotationalyinvariant, the conclusion would not hold.\n\n(c) When the incident energy approaches zero, the wavevector k approaches infinity. Using the above relations, we can show that the wavefunction becomes more and more localized in the origin as θ increases. Thus the scattering amplitude becomes more and more sensitive to small angles. However, this does not necessarily imply that the scattering amplitude is independent of θ.

Thus, the total Hamiltonian becomes: H\\_total = -k\\_B T / (m\\_e c^2) \\* (1 + |v|^2 / c^2) \\* cos^2(θ).\n\nThe time evolution of the electron wave function is given by the Schrödinger equation, which relates the wave function to the total Hamiltonian using the principle of conservation of energy. The Schrödinger equation for the x-coordinate of the electron wave function ψ(x, t) takes the form: iħ ∂ψ(x, t)/∂t = H\\_total ψ(x, t), where i is the imaginary unit and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nTo find the probability for each of the specified outcomes at time t=0, we need to evaluate the wave functions at t=0 and then calculate their absolute squares. The square root of the absolute value represents the probability of finding the electron in a particular state at time t=0.\n\nLet's first consider the case when the electron spin is along the positive x-direction at t=0. This corresponds to the state (a) $s_x = 1/2$. To find the wave function for this state, we need to determine the initial conditions for the x-coordinates of the electron and its momentum.

However, we can express it in terms of the final state probabilities and use the fact that the sum of all possible probabilities must be equal to one. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nProbability(a) = ∫ dx dθ (Ajs\\_x)(x, t) |Ajs\\_x(x, t)|^2 dt\n\nSimilarly, we can compute the probabilities for the other states (b)-(f) by evaluating the wave functions at t=0, determining the initial conditions for their respective x-directions and momenta, and substituting them into the Schrödinger equation. In general, the probability for any state (n) at time t=0 can be expressed as:\nProbability(n) = ∫ dx dθ (An)(x, t) |An(x, t)|^2 dt"}

To calculate the scattering cross-section, we need to evaluate the integral over all space-time configurations that satisfy the condition $|r| < a$. We can classify these configurations into two types: those that lie inside the region $-a < r < a$ and those that lie outside the region $|r| > a$. For the first type of configuration, we have $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 < a^2$, which implies $x^2 + y^2 < a^2$. Since $x^2 + y^2$ represents the square of the distance between the center of the circle and any point on its circumference, it follows that $x^2 + y^2$ must be less than or equal to zero. This means that the points $(x,y)$ that satisfy this inequality lie inside the unit circle centered at the origin.

For the second type of configuration, we have $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 > a^2$, which implies $x^2 + y^2 > a^2$. This means that the points $(x,y)$ that satisfy this inequality lie outside the unit circle centered at the origin.

To find the relationship between the energy splitting of the $\\psi$ and $\\psi'$ and that of the $\\Upsilon$ and $\\Upsilon'$, we can use the fact that these particles are believed to be the $n = 0$ and $n = 1$ bound states of a charm quark and anti-quark pair, or a bottom quark and anti-quark pair, respectively. In general, for a bound state of a system with total angular momentum $J$, the energy $E$ is given by the formula:\n$$E = - \\frac{\\pi}{2} m J (J+1)$$where $m$ is the reduced mass of the system, which is defined as the product of the individual masses divided by their sum. For the charm quark and anti-quark pair, this gives us:\n$$E_{\\text{charm}} = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cdot 1.5\\cdot 2 (2+1) = -6\\pi \\cdot 1.5 = -9\\pi \\text{GeV}$$Similarly, for the bottom quark and anti-quark pair, this gives us:\n$$E_{\\text{bottom}} = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cdot 4.5\\cdot 2 (2+1) = -18\\pi \\text{GeV}$$Since the $\\Upsilon$ and $\\Upsilon'$ are also believed to be the $n = 0$ and $n = 1$ bound states of a charm quark and anti-quark pair, respectively, we can write their respective rest energies as:\n$$E_{\\text{Upset}} = E_{\\text{charm}} + B = -9\\pi + B \\quad \\text{(for } n = 0\\text{)}$$and\n$$E_{\\text{Upset}} = E_{\\text{bottom}} + B = -18\\pi + B \\quad \\text{(for } n = 1\\text{)}.$$Thus, the energy splitting of the $\\Upsilon$ and $\\Upsilon'$ can be expressed in terms of the energy splitting of the $\\psi$ and $\\psi'$ as follows:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\text{Upset}} = E_{\\text{Upset}} - E_{\\text{Upset}}^{\\text{threshold}} = (-9\\pi + B) - (-18\\pi + B)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = (-9\\pi + B)(1 + (-18\\pi + B)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}).$$where we have used the fact that the threshold for the second excited state of a charm quark is $(-18\\pi)^2/4 = 486\\pi^2/4.$\n\nTo find the rest energy of the $\\Upsilon'$, we need to solve for $B$ using the equation $\\Delta E_{\\text{Upset}} = 0$.

This notation represents the电子 configuration of the helium atom, where the first \"1\" indicates that there is one electron in the $1s$ orbital and the second \"1\" indicates that there is one electron in the $2s$ orbital.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the total energy of a system is given by the sum of the energies of all its electrons. For the helium atom, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the two electrons in their respective orbits.\n\nThe $1s$ orbital has a lower energy than the $2s$ orbital because it is closer to the nucleus. This is known as the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two electrons in an atomic Orbital can have the same set of quantum numbers. As a result, when the two electrons in the $1s$ and $2s$ orbitals are in the same shell (n = 2), they cannot be in the same quantum state, so the energy of the system is higher for the triplet state compared to the singlet state.\n\nNow let's find the energy difference between the singlet and triplet states using the formula for the energy of an atomic orbital:\n\n$$E = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\int r^2 dr$$\n\nwhere $r$ is the distance from the center of the atom to the electron in the orbital. Since both the singlet and triplet states have only one electron in each orbital, we can use the wave function of the unpaired electron in the $1s$ and $2s$ orbitals to calculate their respective energies.\n\nFor the singlet state, the wave function is:\n\n$$\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}) = R_1^2 \\sin(\\theta)$$\n\nwhere $R_1$ is the radius of the $1s$ orbital and $\\theta$ is the angle between the positive z-axis and the vector connecting the origin to the electron in the $1s$ orbital.\n\nSimilarly, for the triplet state, the wave function is:\n\n$$\\psi_{2s}(\\mathbf{r}) = R_2^2 \\cos(\\phi)$$\n\nwhere $R_2$ is the radius of the $2s$ orbital and $\\phi$ is the angle between the positive z-axis and the vector connecting the origin to the electron in the $2s$ orbital.\n\nUsing these wave functions, we can calculate the energy of the singlet and triplet states as follows:\n\nEnergy of singlet state = $-\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\int r^2 dr = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} [(-R_1^2)^2 + \\sin^2(\\theta)]$\n\nEnergy of triplet state = $-\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\int r^2 dr = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} [(-R_2^2)^2 + \\cos^2(\\phi)]$\n\nThe energy difference between the singlet and triplet states is then:\n\n$\\Delta E = E_{\\text{triplet}} - E_{\\text{singlet}}$\n\nSubstituting in the expressions above, we get:\n\n$\\Delta E = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} [(-R_2^2)^2 + \\cos^2(\\phi)] - (-\\frac{\\pi}{2} [(-R_1^2)^2 + \\sin^2(\\theta)]) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} R_1^4 \\cos^2(\\phi) - \\frac{\\pi}{2} R_2^4 \\sin^2(\\theta)$\n\nTherefore, the energy difference between the singlet and triplet states is given by the expression:\n\n$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2} R_1^4 \\cos^2(\\phi) - \\frac{\\pi}{2} R_2^4 \\sin^2(\\theta)}$$"}

It is based on the idea that the true solution of a differential equation can be expressed as a series expansion in terms of small parameters, which are then multiplied by the corresponding power of the parameter to obtain the desired result. The accuracy of this approximation is determined by the choice of the power to which the parameter is raised.\n\nFor the one-dimensional time-independent Schrödinger equation, the general form is given by:\n$$i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\psi = H\\psi$$\nwhere $H$ is the Hamiltonian operator and $\\psi$ is the wave function. In order to use the WKB approximation, we need to find the value of the parameter $\\epsilon$ such that the term containing $\\epsilon$ in the series expansion has been integrated and converges to zero. This requires that the matrix element $[H-\\epsilon I]^{-1}$ exists and is non-singular.\n\nLet us first consider the case where the matrix element is invertible. To ensure convergence, we require that the eigenvalues of $[H-\\epsilon I]^{-1}$ have magnitude less than 1. Let $\\lambda_n$ denote the eigenvalues of $[H-\\epsilon I]^{-1}$, then we have:\n$$|\\lambda_n|<\\frac{1}{N}$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of eigenvalues. Since all the eigenvalues are real numbers, it follows that the eigenvalues satisfy:\n$$\\Re(\\lambda_n)<\\frac{1}{N}$$\nThis implies that the matrix element $[H-\\epsilon I]^{-1}$ is positive definite, i.e., all its eigenvalues are positive. Therefore, if the matrix element is invertible, the WKB approximation is valid provided that the parameter $\\epsilon$ is chosen so that the term containing $\\epsilon$ in the series expansion has been properly integrated and converges to zero.\n\nNow let us consider the case where the matrix element is not invertible. In this case, the eigenvalues may have magnitude greater than or equal to 1. For example, if the Hamiltonian operator $H$ has a resonance frequency, then the eigenvalues of $H-\\epsilon I$ will approach zero as $\\epsilon$ goes to zero, making the matrix element numerically singular. In this case, the WKB approximation is invalid in the immediate neighborhood of a classical turning point because the leading term in the series expansion does not converge to zero.\n\nTherefore, the WKB approximation fails in the immediate neighborhood of a classical turning point if the matrix element $[H-\\epsilon I]^{-1}$ is either numerically singular or has eigenvalues with magnitude greater than or equal to 1.\n\n**Part (b): Perturbation Theory**\n\nPerturbation theory is a powerful tool for studying the behavior of a system in the presence of an external field. It consists of expanding the Hamiltonian operator $H$ into a series of small deviations from a reference value, called the \"perturbation.\" The resultingmatrix element $[H+\\delta V]^{-1}$ can then be used to calculate the effects of the perturbation on the energy levels of the system.\n\nIn the context of an atom in an external electric field, the Hamiltonian operator $H$ takes the form:\n$$H=T+V$$\nwhere"}

The electron's motion is affected by the magnetic field, which causes the electron to move in a circular path instead of a straight path.

The Hamiltonian operator for the system can be written as:\n\\[H(x,t) = T(x,t) + V(x)\\]\nwhere $T(x,t)$ is the time-independent part of the Hamiltonian and $V(x)$ is the time-dependent part given by the electric field $E$. Since the potential well is infinite, we assume that $T(x,t)=0$ outside the region $|x|\\leq a/2$. We focus on the region $|x|<a/2$ and linearize the time-dependent term around the static potential $V(x)$.\nTo apply time-dependent perturbation theory, we require that the matrix element $\\ \"<H(x',t), H(x'',t)>\"$ is small enough so that it does not affect the eigenvalues of $H(x,t)$, i.e., the energies of the two eigenstates $n=1$ and $n=2$.

In the presence of the electric field, the wave function $\\psi(x,t)$ changes over time according to the equation:\n\\[\\iota\\partial\\psi(x,t)/\\partial t = (E-V(x))\\psi(x,t)\\]\nWe want to compute the probabilities $P_2$ and $P_3$ that the electron will be in the $n=2$ and $n=3$ states, respectively, at $t>\\tau$. To do this, we first find the time evolution of each state under the electric field. For $n=1$, the time evolution is given by:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\psi_1(x,t) &= A_1 e^{-(\\lambda_1+E_1 t)} \\\\\n&= A_1 [1 - (\\lambda_1+E_1 t)^2/8]^{1/2}\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $A_1$ is the initial probability density and $\\lambda_1=\\sqrt{\\lambda^2-1/8}$ is the eigenvalue corresponding to $n=1$.

In a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the potential energy $V(x)$ is given by $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2$ where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the position of the particle. The kinetic energy $K$ of the oscillator is given by $K = \\frac{1}{2} m \\left(\\frac{d\\动能}{dx}\\right)^2$. We also know that the center of mass moves with the motion of the electron, so we have $\\frac{M}{m} = 1$, where $M$ is the mass of the oscillator and $m$ is the mass of the electron.

When the electron is in its first excited state, its position will be different from the average position ($\\langle x \\rangle$). This difference is called the \"displacement\" $x_d$ and is related to the Excited State Energy ($E$) as follows:$$E = \\frac{1}{2} k x_d^2 + V(x_d)$$We want to find $x_d$ and then use it to determine $E$. To do this, we need to express $x_d$ in terms of $\\langle x \\rangle$ and $k/m$. Since thevirial theorem states that for a system with multiple degrees of freedom, the expectation value of the square of the displacement is equal to twice the expectation value of the force acting on the system divided by the mass of the system, we have:$$\\sqrt{\\langle (x-\\langle x \\rangle)^2 \\rangle} = 2\\frac{F}{\\frac{1}{2}m}=\\frac{2F}{m}=2\\frac{k}{m}=2\\cdot \\frac{4m}{10^9}=8\\cdot 10^{-7}$$Thus, $x_d=8\\cdot 10^{-7}\\cdot \\langle x \\rangle$.

Since the particle is in its ground state, it has zero energy. As such, the only way it can move is if it is forced to change direction. In this case, the particle will either stay in the same direction or switch directions and move in the opposite direction.\n\nWhen the wall at $x=L$ is moved to $x=2L$, the particle will experience a force that pushes it to one side of the box or the other. If the particle is moving towards the right when the wall is moved, it will now be pushed leftwards towards the wall at $x=2L$. Conversely, if the particle is moving towards the left when the wall is moved, it will now be pushed rightwards towards the wall at $x=2L$. Therefore, the particle's motion is changed by a force that is perpendicular to its initial velocity. This force is equal to the force exerted on the particle by the wall at $x=2L$, which is given by the equation:\n\n$$F = \\frac{\\Delta x}{L} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{L} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(\\frac{1}{L} \\cdot \\frac{dF}{\\partial x}\\right)$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta x = 2L - L = L$ is the distance the particle travels during the time it takes for the wall to move, and $d/dx$ denotes the derivative of a function evaluated at a point. Using the fact that the force is perpendicular to the initial velocity, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{dF}{dx} = -\\frac{1}{L^2}$$\n\nTherefore, the force exerted on the particle is given by:\n\n$$F = \\frac{1}{L} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(\\frac{1}{L} \\cdot \\frac{dF}{\\partial x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{L^3}$$\n\nSince the particle is in its ground state and has no kinetic energy, it does not change its total energy. However, it changes its potential energy, which is given by the difference between the initial and final positions of the particle. When the wall is moved, the particle's position changes by $2L-L=L$, so its potential energy decreases by $-\\frac{1}{2} m L^2$ where $m$ is the mass of the particle. Since the particle is in its ground state, its potential energy is zero, so its total energy remains constant.\n\nThe probability that the particle will be found in the ground state of the expanded box after the wall is moved to $x=2L$ is therefore equal to the ratio of the time the particle spends in the ground state to the total time it spends in the box:\n\n$$P(\\text{ground state}) = \\frac{\\text{time in ground state}}{\\text{total time}} = \\frac{L}{2L} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThus, the probability that the particle will be found in the ground state of the expanded box is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\end{align*}"}

Evaluate the resulting expression to obtain the differential cross-section for forward scattering.\n\n Step 1: Expressing the given integral in terms of $\\rho$ and $E$ We can start by using the definition of charge density $\\rho$ to write the given integral as follows: $$\\int r^2 \\rho \\, d^3x = \\int r^2 \\rho \\, (\\rho \\, dr \\, dx \\, d\\theta)$$where $d\\theta$ is the angular integration over the scattering angle ($\\theta$) variable. Since $\\rho$ is spherical对称 about the origin, it does not depend on the position coordinates, so we have$$\\int r^2 \\rho \\, d^3x = \\int r^2 \\rho \\, dr \\, dx.$$Now, let us apply the first born approximation to the integrand of the above equation. According to the first born approximation, the charge density $\\rho$ can be approximated as$\\rho \\approx q(\\rho_0 + z f)$, where $q$ is a constant, $\\rho_0$ is the charge density at some reference point, and $z$ is a scaling factor that depends on the distance from the reference point.

The phase shift of the transmitted wave determines the angle of incidence of the reflected wave, which in turn determines the final direction of the electron's path. This can be described mathematically as:\n\n$$\\delta = \\int d^3r' \\, |f(r')|^2 \\sin(\\theta') d\\theta'$$\n\nwhere $f(r)$ is the wave function of the electron in the presence of the neutral atom, $f(r')$ is the reflection coefficient, $\\theta'$ is the angle of incidence of the reflected wave, and $\\delta$ is the phase shift.\n\nThe Schrödinger equation can be used to solve for the wave functions $f(r)$ and $f'(r)$, the time evolution of the electron and its image respectively. The initial condition for the problem is that the electron is incident on the atom at time $t=0$, so we can set $f(0)=f_i$ and $f'(0)=f_i'$.\n\n(b) The differential scattering cross section is given by:\n\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{1}{4\\pi R^2} \\left|\\int d^3r \\, |f(r)|^2 \\sin(\\theta) d\\theta\\right|^2$$\n\nwhere $|f(r)|^2$ is the square modulus of the wave function squared, and the integral is taken over all space. This expression represents the probability density of the electron being scattered in a certain direction, weighted by the square of the amplitude of the wave function.\n\nUsing the角动量守恒 and the fact that the electron is incident on the atom at time $t=0$, we can express the wave function $f(r)$ in terms of the ingoing and outgoing wave functions $f_i$ and $f_i'$ as:\n\n$$f(r) = \\frac{f_i}{R} \\cos(kr-\\ delta)$$\n\nSubstituting this into the above expression gives:\n\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{1}{4\\pi R^2} \\left|\\int d^3r \\, \\frac{f_i^2}{R^2} \\cos(kr-\\delta)^2 d\\theta\\right|^2$$\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{f_i^2}{4\\pi R^4} \\left[ \\cos(2kr-\\delta)^2 + \\cos(2kr+\\delta)^2 \\right]$$\n\n(c) In a purely attractive potential, there is no energy loss for the electron during its passage through the atom. Therefore, the wave function remains unchanged along the axis of symmetry of the atom, leading to a constant phase shift of zero. This means that the differential scattering cross section is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the wave function squared, which gives a constant cross section regardless of the value of $k$.\n\n(d) For a potential that is attractive at short distances but repulsive at large distances, the wave function will have a stronger attraction at shorter distances, causing the electron to be more localized around the nucleus. At these短 distances, the potential energy of the electron is low enough that the wave function is close to the flat state, where the derivative is zero. This causes the phase shift to be small, resulting in minimal scattering. As the electron moves further away from the nucleus, the potential energy becomes higher, causing the wave function to deviate from the flat state and the phase shift to become larger. This results in increased scattering.\n\nTo specifically see this behavior, consider"}

In this equation, we can see that there are three terms representing three different energy levels due to the presence of the external field.\n\n接下来，我们考虑钠原子的激发态。钠原子只有一个基态：ground state ，其电子排布为1s^1。在这种情况下，我们只有一个轨道可以容纳电子。因此，当我们施加一个外加电场时，这个轨道中的电子只会发生二次的能量变化。 Since the electrons in sodium atoms have only one possible arrangement, they can only exhibit a quadratic Stark effect, as shown below:\n\\[Na = Na + e^{-i\\omega r} = (-1)^ne^{i\\omega r} + (-1)^ne^{i\\omega r} \\]\nIn this equation, we can see that there are two terms representing two different energy levels due to the presence of the external field.\n\nIn summary, the reason for the difference in the behavior of excited states of atomic hydrogen and sodium is due to their distinct electronic structures. Hydrogen has a more complex electronic structure with multiple possible arrangements of electrons in its excited states, which allows it to exhibit a linear Stark effect. On the other hand, sodium has a simpler electronic structure with only one possible arrangement of electrons, which results in a quadratic Stark effect."}

Therefore, the only non-zero contributions come from the terms with $k=n$, $-j$, and $k=-j$. These contribute:\n\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\phi_j(x,t) = (-j)^n \\phi_n(x,t) + (-j)^n \\phi_n'(x,t) t,$$\n\nwhere $\\phi_n'(x,t)$ denotes the derivative of $\\phi_n(x,t)$ with respect to $t$.\n\nNext, we need to express the time evolution of each component in terms of the original wave function $\\psi(x,t)$. We have:\n\n$$ \\phi_j(x,t) = \\int \\psi(x',t) \\phi_j(x',t) dt'$$\n\nUsing the fact that $\\psi(x,t)$ is a product of polynomials, we can expand this integral as follows:\n\n$$ \\phi_j(x,t) = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\int \\psi_k(x',t) \\phi_j(x',t) dt'.$$\n\nHere, $\\psi_k(x',t)$ denotes the $k$-th component of the wave function $\\psi(x,t)$. Now, we can use the fact that the components $\\phi_j(x,t)$ satisfy the condition $\\int \\phi_j(x',t) dx' = \\delta_j(x)$ to simplify the above expression further:\n\n$$ \\phi_j(x,t) = \\sum_{k=1}^n (\\delta_j(x)-\\delta_j(x')) \\int \\psi_k(x',t) dt'.$$\n\nFinally, we can use the fact that the series converges to a finite value as $|x-x'|\\to\\infty$ to obtain the desired result:\n\n$$ |\\phi_j(x,t)|^2 \\to \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} |(\\delta_j(x)-\\delta_j(x'))|^2 \\to 0, $$\n\nwhich implies that $|\\phi_j(x,t)|^2 \\to 0$ as $t\\to\\infty$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that after a sufficiently long time $t$, the wave function of the particle spreads to"}

Instead, we will use numerical methods to find approximate solutions.\n\nUsing numerical methods like the finite difference method or the finite element method, we can calculate the potential energy $E$ at various positions $x_1$ and $x_2$ inside the well. We then look for the values of $x_1$ and $x_2$ where the gradient of $V$ is zero, which corresponds to the minimum potential energy state.\n\nOnce we find the approximate values of $x_1$ and $x_2$, we can plug them into the equation for the potential energy to obtain the ground state energy.\n\n\\[ E_{\\text{ground}} = V(x_1 - x_2) \\approx 0 \\quad (\\text{using numerical methods}) \\]\n\nWe can see that the ground state energy is zero within numerical accuracy.\n\nStep 2: Label the three lowest-energy states\nSince the ground state energy is zero, there are no lower energy states available to label.

For electrons in solids this condition can be restated in terms of the size $S$ of the orbit in k-space. Obtain the quantization condition on $S$ in terms of $B$ (Ignore spin effects).", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "\n To begin, we start by substituting the given expression for $P$ into the semi-classical Bohr-Sommerfeld relation:\n\n$$\n\\oint p \\cdot dr = (n + 1/2) \\, h,\n$$\n\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant. This gives us:\n\n$$\n\\int p \\cdot dl = (n + 1/2) \\, h,\n$$\n\nwhere $dl$ is the differential length element around a closed path.

This is the equation of motion for the linear momentum $p$ of the semi-classical electron in a magnetic field $B$.\n\nNext, we use the equation of motion for the linear momentum $p$ to derive a quantization condition on the magnetic flux of the electron. The magnetic flux through a closed loop is given by the surface integral\n\n$$\n\\oint B \\cdot dS = \\int B \\cdot dl,\n$$\n\nwhere $dS$ is the infinitesimal surface area element of the loop.

This means that the magnetic flux of the electron is always zero, regardless of the shape or size of the orbit.\n\nFinally, we want to express this result in terms of the size $S$ of the orbit in k-space. To do this, we note that the magnetic field $B$ acts as a potential Vlasov term in the action for the electron, which is given by\n\n$$\nS = \\int ds,\n$$\n\nwhere $ds$ is the proper distance element between two points in space. Using the identity $\\nabla \\times B = -\\partial B/\\partial t$, we obtain\n\n$$\nV = -\\int B \\cdot dS = -\\int B \\cdot \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial t} dt = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int B \\cdot S dt,\n$$\n\nwhere we have used the fact that $S$ is a scalar density and not a vector field.

We can determine the number of electrons in each level by counting the number of times the Bessel function appears in the radial distribution function $F(\\rho)$.\n\nFor example, if the radial distribution function has a significant peak at $\\rho = 3$, this indicates that there are several electrons in the region $\\rho \\approx 3$ Å away from the center of the ring.

Since theparticle only moves in the x-direction, it can be treated as a one-dimensional system. Let's start by finding the energy of the particle in its ground state.\n\nIn the ground state, the particle is at the left endpoint of the region, so its position is $x=0$. At this point, the particle has no kinetic energy because it is at rest. Therefore, the total energy of the particle in its ground state is zero.\n\nNext, let's consider what happens when the walls are suddenly separated to infinity. In this case, the particle is now free to move in the x-direction without any constraints. The motion is still one-dimensional, but now the particle can have both positive and negative kinetic energy.\n\nTo find the probability that the particle has momentum between $p$ and $p+dp$, we need to consider the possible positions of the particle in the无限-width potential well. Since the particle is initially at the left endpoint of the region, it has a certain amount of kinetic energy that allows it to escape the region. This energy is given by the initial velocity $v_0=\\sqrt{\\frac{2ma}{m}}$.\n\nThe probability density function (PDF) of the particle's position as a function of time can then be written as:\n\n$$f(x,t)=A\\sin(\\omega t-\\phi)$$\n\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude of the oscillation, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $\\phi$ is the phase angle.

To find the probability that the particle has momentum between $p$ and $p+dp$, we need to integrate the PDF over the relevant range of positions and momenta. However, integrating over the entire space domain ($-a$ to $a$) would lead to an infinite integral.

Substituting these values into the equation for $p$ and $U$, we get: \\begin{align*}\np&=\\sqrt{2m(-\\frac{1}{8})}\\\\\n&=-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}m\\\\\n&=-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}\\cdot\\frac{m_p}{3}\\\\\n&=\\frac{-1}{6}\\sqrt{2}m_p\\\\\n&=-\\frac{1}{6}\\sqrt{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}m_p\\\\\n&=\\frac{-1}{18}\\sqrt{2}m_p\\\\\n&=-\\frac{1}{96}\\sqrt{2}m_p.\n\\end{align*}The excitation energy is then given by $E_{\\text{excited}}=K-U=p^2-U=(-\\frac{1}{96}\\sqrt{2}m_p)^2+U$. Plugging in our expression for $U$, we have $$E_{\\text{excited}}=(\\frac{-1}{96}\\sqrt{2}m_p)^2+\\left(-N\\frac{\\pi}{4a^3}\\right)=(\\frac{-1}{96}\\sqrt{2}m_p)^2+\\left(-8\\times 10^{27}\\frac{\\pi}{4\\times 2\\times 10^{-13}^3}\\right).$$Simplifying this expression yields $$E_{\\text{excited}}=\\frac{-1}{96}\\sqrt{2}m_p^2+\\frac{-8\\pi N}{4a^3}=-\\frac{1}{96}\\sqrt{2}m_p^2+\\frac{-8\\pi\\cdot 8\\times 10^{27}}{4\\times 2\\times 10^{-13}^3}.$$Finally, plugging in the value of $m_p$ gives us $$E_{\\text{excited}}=-\\frac{1}{96}\\sqrt{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\cancelto{1}{3}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\"}

We can do this by finding the values of the energy that satisfy the equation for the potential well:\n$$E_n = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{8}k\\int (x^2) dx = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}kx^3/6.$$Since the integral does not have any simple closed form solutions, we will use numerical integration to compute these energies.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5 cm);\n\nreal func (real x) {\n  return(-sqrt(func((x-1))^2 + 1));\n}\n\ndraw(graph(func,-1.5,1.5),red);\ndraw((-1.5,0)--(1.5,0));\ndraw((0,-1.5)--(0,1.5));\nlabel(\"$E = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}kx^3/6$\",(1.5,func(1.5)),NE);\n[/asy]\n\nWe find that the energy levels for the potential well without the electric field are given by:\n\n$$E_1 = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}k,\\quad E_2 = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}k + \\frac{\\pi^2}{2}, \\quad E_3 = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}k + \\frac{3\\pi^2}{4},\\quad \\ldots$$\n\nNext, we consider the effect of the electric field on the energy levels. The electric field causes the electron to move in a circular path instead of beingconfined in the well. This means that the kinetic energy of the electron increases or decreases depending on whether it is moving towards or away from the center of the well. However, since our potential well has a flat top, the only effect of the electric field is to shift the position of the electron along its circular path. Therefore, the energy levels will be shifted by an amount proportional to the electric field strength.\n\nThe electric field modifies the force acting on the electron, which in turn affects its motion. In particular, the centripetal force required to keep the electron in its orbit becomes larger or smaller depending on the electric field direction. Since the electron starts with zero velocity, the total energy of the electron remains constant. Thus, the new energy levels after applying the electric field will be:\n\n$$E_1' = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}k + qE,\\quad E_2' = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}k + qE + \\frac{\\pi^2}{2},\\quad E_3' = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}k + qE + \\frac{3\\pi^2}{4},\\quad \\ldots$$where $q$ is the magnitude of the electric field vector.\n\nNow, we want to find the corresponding wave functions $\\psi_n'$ for each energy level. Using the fact that the wave function satisfies the time-independent Schrödinger equation, we have\n\n$$\\psi_n'(x) = A_n e^{-i\\left(\\frac{-E_n'}{h}x-\\frac{\\pi n}{2}\\right)}.$$where $A_n$ is some constant that depends on the initial conditions.\n\nTo find $A_n$, we can use the condition that the wave function is normalized, i.e.,\n\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|\\psi_n'|^2 dx = 1.$$Substituting the expressions for $E_n'$ and $P_n$, we get\n\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|\\psi_n'|^2 dx = \\frac{1}{\\pi^2n^2 h^2}.$$Thus, we must have\n\n$$A_n^2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi^2n^2 h^2}$$for all positive integers $n$.\n\nTherefore, the energy levels with the electric field present are given by:\n\n$$E_n' = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}k + qE + \\frac{1}{\\pi^2n^2 h^2}(1+\\cos\\theta_n'),$$where $\\theta_n'$ is the argument of the wave function $\\psi_n'$.\n\nFor the case when the electric field is parallel to the axis of the well, we have $\\theta_n'=0$, so the energy levels become\n\n$$E_n' = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}k + qE + \\frac{1}{\\pi^2n^2 h^2}.$$This expression shows that the energy levels are shifted by an amount proportional to the electric field strength $q$.\n\nNext, we find the expectation value of $x$ for each energy level with the electric field present.

Separate the variable $\\E$ from the other variables in the equation using the method of separation of variables.\n4.

In our case, since the rotor is rotating around its axis of rotation, we can write the position vector as $(R\\cos(\\theta), R\\sin(\\theta))$, where $R$ is the radius of the rotor. Substituting this into the equation gives us:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{I}{2M}} \\cos(\\theta) e^{-i\\omega t}\\right) = E\\sqrt{\\frac{I}{2M}} \\cos(\\theta)e^{-i\\omega t}$$\nwhere $M$ is the reduced mass of the rotor, defined as $m=\\frac{I}{2M}$. The frequency $\\omega$ is related to the electric field strength $\\Em$ by $\\omega=\\sqrt{\\Em/h}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant.\n\nStep 2: Constraint on Rotation\nSince the rotor is constrained to rotate in one plane, we can use the constraint $L=0$, where $L$ is the angular momentum operator. This gives us the condition:\n$$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta}=0$$\nwhich implies that $\\sin(\\theta)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}-\\cos(\\theta)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}=0$.

Therefore, the initial energy of the particle is $E_1 = \\frac{1}{2} m\\omega^2 x^2 = \\frac{1}{2} kx^2$.

The energy of the particle in the new potential can be calculated using the formula $E_2 = \\frac{1}{2} m\\omega^2 x^2$. Comparing this with the expression for $E_1$, we see that $E_2 = E_1 = \\frac{1}{2} kx^2$.\n\nThe probability for finding the particle in the ground state of the new potential $V_2$ is equal to the ratio of the time it takes for the particle to fall out of the ground state in $V_2$ to the total time period for which the spring constant is doubled.

This means that the particle will never fall out of the ground state in $V_2$ if the spring constant is doubled. Therefore, there is no value of T that satisfies the condition that the initial ground state in $V_1$ is restored with 100% certainty.\n\nHence, the answer to part (a) is that there is no value of T that satisfies the condition, and therefore the probability for finding the particle in the ground state of the new potential $V_2$ is 0.\n\nFor part (b), we need to find the values of T such that the initial ground state in $V_1$ is restored with 100% certainty. As before, the energy of the particle in $V_2$ is always equal to or greater than the initial energy in $V_1$. This means that the particle will never fall out of the ground state in $V_2$ even when the spring constant is restored back to its original value. Hence, there is no value of T that satisfies the condition, and the probability for finding the initial ground state in $V_1$ with 100% certainty is also 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answers to both parts of the question are:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{(a)} & \\quad 0 \\\\\n\\text{(b)} & \\quad 0\n\\end{align*}"}

Since the table is recoiless, there is no loss of kinetic energy when the ball hits the ground, so the total energy of the system is conserved.

We know that:\n$$\\mathbf{B} = B_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$$\nSo,\n$$V = q\\left( B_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} - \\mathbf{B} \\right)$$\nUsing the properties of the dot product, we can rewrite this as:\n$$V = q\\left[ B_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} - B_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} \\right]$$\nSimplifying further, we get:\n$$V = -qB_0^2 \\sin(\\omega t)$$\nThus, the Hamiltonian matrix for the system is:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} H & 0 \\\\ 0 & -qB_0^2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n### Part (b): Finding the Spin State $\\chi(t)$\n\nWe are given that the electron starts out in the spin-up state with respect to the $x$-axis. Therefore, the initial wave function is:\n$$\\psi(x,t=0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis means that the spin component of the wave function is always along the positive z-direction.\n\nTo find the spin state $\\chi(t)$, we need to determine the time evolution of the wave function. Since this is a time-dependent problem, we cannot use the standard method of finding the time-evolution of a stationary state. Instead, we will solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation directly.\n\nThe time-dependent Schrödinger equation for the wave function $\\psi(x,t)$ is given by:\n$$i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\psi(x,t) = H\\psi(x,t)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $H$ we derived earlier, we get:\n$$i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -qB_0^2 \\sin(\\omega t) & 0 \\\\ 0 & (-qB_0^2 \\sin(\\omega t)) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -qB_0^2 \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nUsing the fact that the wave function is沿z-direction, we can simplify this further to:\n$$i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -qB_0^2 \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = i(-qB_0^2 \\sin(\\omega t)).$$\nFrom this, we can see that the spin component of the wave function remains unchanged throughout time.

Since the system is translationally invariant (meaning that shifting the position does not change the dynamics), the Hamiltonian $H$ is also translationallyinvariant. This implies that the wave function $\\psi(t)$ is also translationallyinvariant.\n\nNow, let's consider the evolution operator $U(t)$, which describes how the state of the system changes over time $t$. The evolution operator is given by:\n\n$$U(t) = e^{-iHt}$$\n\nSince $H$ is translationallyinvariant, $U(t)$ is also translationallyinvariant.

The wave equation for wave propagation in one dimension is given by:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial t^2} = k^2\\sin(kx - wt)$$\nwhere $u(x,t)$ is the displacement of the particle from its equilibrium position at time $t,$ $x$ is the position along the x-axis, $k$ is the wave number, $w$ is the angular frequency, and $t$ is time. In our case, there is only one dimension, so we can simplify this equation to:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = k^2\\sin(kx - wt)$$\nThis equation describes how the amplitude of the wave decreases as we move away from the source.\n\nStep 2: Consider a small section of the barrier that is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Let $\\delta x$ be the distance between the two barriers, and let $L$ be the length of the section of the barrier. We want to find the reflection coefficient $R$ which is defined as the ratio of the amplitudes reflected and transmitted across the barrier.\n\nWe can use the principle of superposition to find the reflection and transmission coefficients. When a wave travels through the barrier, it reflects back with the same phase and amplitude as it did before crossing the barrier. Therefore, the reflection coefficient is equal to the amplitude of the incident wave squared divided by the sum of the squares of the reflection and transmission coefficients:\n$$R=\\frac{E_i^2}{E_r+E_t}$$\nwhere $E_i$ is the amplitude of the incident wave, $E_r$ is the amplitude of the reflected wave, and $E_t$ is the amplitude of the transmitted wave.\n\nStep 3: To find the reflection and transmission coefficients, we need to consider the wave nature of the system. At the surface of the barrier, the wave has zero amplitude because there is no energy on either side of the barrier. At $x=x_1$, the incident wave changes direction, and its amplitude starts decreasing exponentially as it moves toward $x_2$. Therefore, the reflection coefficient will be large when $|x-x_1|$ is small compared to $|x-x_2|$, and will approach zero as $|x-x_1|$ becomes larger. Similarly, the transmission coefficient will be large when $|x-x_2|$ is small compared to $|x-x_1|$, and will approach zero as $|x-x_2|$ becomes larger.\n\nTherefore, we can approximate the reflection and transmission coefficients as follows:\n$$E_r \\approx E_i \\quad \\text{for } |x-x_1| \\leq \\frac{\\delta x}{2}$$\n$$E_t \\approx 0 \\quad \\text{for } |x-x_2| > \\frac{\\delta x}{2}$$\nThe approximation for $E_r$ means that the反射 wave has the same amplitude as the incident wave when the distance between the barriers is smaller than half the width of the barrier. This is known as the \"diffraction condition\".\n\nStep 4"}

This expression can be written as:\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{Born}} = \\frac{e^2}{8\\pi mc^2}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dr\\sigma(r)\\left|\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\frac{\\sin(\\omega r)}{r}\\right|^2.\\label{eq2}$$where $m$ is the reduced mass of the particle, which is defined as $m = \\frac{E}{P}$, where $E$ is the kinetic energy of the particle and $P$ is its momentum.\n\nTo compare the partial wave and Born approximation scattering cross-sections, we can consider the ratio:\n$$R = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{partial}}/\\sigma_{\\text{Born}}}{1 + z^2},\\label{eq3}$$where $z$ is the complex number that satisfies $z^2 = 1/k^2$, where $k$ is the wave number of the particle. For real values of $k$, this equation reduces to $z = i k / (2m)$, which corresponds to the cutoff frequency of the particle.\n\nWe can now proceed to calculate the partial wave and Born approximation scattering cross-sections using the expressions provided above and then compare them numerically or analytically."}
