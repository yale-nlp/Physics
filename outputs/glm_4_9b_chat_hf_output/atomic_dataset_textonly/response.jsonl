{"id": "atomic/1-12", "questions": "The electric field that an atom experiences from its surroundings within a molecule or crystal can noticeably affect properties of the atomic ground state. An interesting example has to do with the phenomenon of angular momentum quenching in the iron atom of the hem group in the hemoglobin of your blood. Iron and hemoglobin are too complicated, however. So consider an atom containing one valence electron moving in a central atomic potential. It is in an $l = 1$ level. Ignore spin. We ask what happens to this level when the electron is acted on by the external potential arising from \nthe atom's surroundings. Take this external potential to be\n\n$$\nV_{\\text{pert}} = Ax^2 + By^2 - (A + B)z^2\n$$\n\n(the atomic nucleus is at the origin of coordinates) and treat it to lowest \norder.\n\n(a) The $l = 1$ level now splits into three distinct levels. As you can \nconfirm (and as we hint at) each has a wave function of the form\n\n$$\n\\Psi = (\\alpha x + \\beta y + \\gamma z)f(r),\n$$\n\nwhere $f(r)$ is a common central function and where each level has its own set \nof constants $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)$, which you will need to determine. Sketch the energy \nlevel diagram, specifying the relative shifts $\\Delta E$ in terms of the parameters \n$A$ and $B$ (i.e., compute the three shifts up to a common factor).\n\n(b) More interesting: Compute the expectation value of $L_z$, the $z$ com- \nponent of angular momentum, for each of the three levels.\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "\npotential energy levels, \n### $$functionality of the functionalism of the functionality of the functionality of the function of the function \n\n## function\n\n## function\n\n## Function\n\nFunction\n\nF\n\n## Function\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n##\n\n##]\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\n##\n\nThere\n\n##\n## \n##\n##\n##\n##\n##\n##\n##\n## and\n##% and the complexity of the behavior of stress in the\nin the\n##**\n**In **-\n** -\n##**\n##**\n##**\n##**\n##**\n##**\n\n# **Your **##**\n##**\n##**\n##**\n##**\n**$\n**#\n##**\n##**\n**-**\n##**\n##**∞##**\n# → ∇ �盟\n→ ∠ →↊\n##**##**########**##**##**######, but I am not valid, because the result,\n\nI have noamsterdam\n\n## What is known as Amsterdam,\n## Amatueresultation!\n\nAmsterdam\n\nThe big question mark?\n\n## The big question:\n\n## The big question?\n!** question\n\nbig** question\n\n**question:** **big** _** **question**\n\n**_**\n**_\n\n**• Question marks\n\n## _Question._amateur™\n\n##\"somebody\n##\n#\n\n**•\n\n##\n\n##_ _yourself\n\n##you\n\nbeauty]  \n\n##\n**This is correct**\n\nisn't know} # \n\n## \n\n## this is the same; our world\n\nWe must go back to the world, but also, but, but, but, the world, ** **\n\n**  \n**  \n**  \n## **yourself, my journey ––a question?

{"id": "atomic/3-34", "questions": "The invariant-mass spectrum of $\\Lambda^0$ and $\\pi^+$ in the reaction $K^- + p \\rightarrow \\Lambda^0 + \\pi^+ + \\pi^-$ shows a peak at 1385 MeV with a full width of 50 MeV. It is called $Y_1^\\ast$. The $\\Lambda^0 \\pi^-$ invariant-mass spectrum from the same reaction (but different events) shows a similar peak.\n\n(a) From these data determine the strangeness, hypercharge and isospin of $Y_1^\\ast$.\n\n(b) Evidence indicates that the product $\\Lambda^0+\\pi^+$ from a $Y_1^\\ast$ in a relative $p$ state of angular momentum. What spin assignments $J$ are possible for the $Y_1^\\ast$? What is its intrinsic parity?

Consider a block of $U^{235}$ in the shape of a cube of side $L$.

In particular, explain why $A$ and $B$ are both positive.\n\n(b) There is a critical length $L_0$ for the sides of the $U^{235}$ cube. For $L > L_0$, the neutron density in the cube is unstable and increases exponentially with time — an explosion results. For $L < L_0$, the neutron density decreases with time — there is no explosion.

{"id": "atomic/4-32", "questions": "The reaction\n\n$$\np + p \\rightarrow \\pi^+ + D,\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nin which energetic protons from an accelerator strike resting protons to produce positive pi-meson-deuteron pairs, was an important reaction in the \"early days\" of high-energy physics.\n\n(a) Calculate the threshold kinetic energy $T$ in the laboratory for the incident proton. That is, $T$ is the minimum laboratory kinetic energy allowing the reaction to proceed. Express $T$ in terms of the proton mass $m_p$, the pion mass $m_\\pi$, and the deuteron mass $m_D$. Evaluate $T$, taking $m_p = 938 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2$, $m_D = 1874 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2$, $m_\\pi = 140 \\, \\text{MeV}/c^2$.\n\n(b) Assume that the reaction is isotropic in the center-of-mass system. That is, the probability of producing a $\\pi^+$ in the solid angle element $d\\Omega^* = d\\phi^* d(\\cos \\theta^*)$ is constant, independent of angle. Find an expression for the normalized probability of the $\\pi^+$ per unit solid angle in the laboratory, in terms of $\\cos \\theta_\\text{lab}$, the velocity $\\beta c$ of the center of mass, the $\\pi^+$ velocity $\\beta c$ in the laboratory, and the momentum $p^*$ in the center of mass.\n\n(c) In 2-body endothermic reactions such as (1) it can happen that the probability per unit solid angle in the laboratory for a reaction product can be singular at an angle $\\theta \\neq 0$.

{"id": "atomic/3-48", "questions": "It has been suggested that the universe is filled with heavy neutrinos $\\nu_H$ (mass $m_H$) which decay into a lighter neutrino $\\nu_L$ (mass $m_L$) and a photon, $\\nu_H \\rightarrow \\nu_L + \\gamma$, with a lifetime similar to the age of the universe. The $\\nu_H$ were produced at high temperatures in the early days, but have since cooled and, in fact, they are now so cold that the decay takes place with the $\\nu_H$ essentially at rest.\n\n(a) Show that the photons produced are monoenergetic and find their energy.\n\n(b) Evaluate your expression for the photon energy in the limit $m_L \\ll m_H$. If the heavy neutrinos have a mass of 50 eV as has been suggested by recent terrestrial experiments, and $m_L \\ll m_H$, in what spectral regime should one look for these photons?\n\n(c) Suppose the lifetime of the heavy neutrinos were short compared to the age of the universe, but that they were still \"cold\" (in the above sense) at the time of decay.

{"id": "atomic/2-46", "questions": "For some years now, R. Davis and collaborators have been searching for solar neutrinos, in a celebrated experiment that employs as detector a large tank of $C_2Cl_4$ located below ground in the Homestake mine. The idea is to look for argon atoms $(A^{37})$ produced by the inverse $\\beta$-decay reaction $Cl^{37}(\\nu, e^-)Ar^{37}$. This reaction, owing to threshold effects, is relatively insensitive to low energy neutrinos, which constitute the expected principal component of neutrinos from the sun. It is supposed to respond to a smaller component of higher energy neutrinos expected from the sun. The solar constant (radiant energy flux at the earth) is $\\sim 1 \\, \\text{kW/m}^2$.\n\n(a) Outline the principal sequence of nuclear processes presumed to account for energy generation in the sun.
