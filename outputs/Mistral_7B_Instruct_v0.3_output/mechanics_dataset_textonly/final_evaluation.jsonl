After some time `t`, the spaceship will have moved a distance `vt`. The distance between the Earth and the point where the radar pulse was sent is now `d + vt`.

{"id": "mechanics/1_34", "solution": " (a) To find the force exerted by the spaceship on the rope, we first need to calculate the net force acting on the combined system of the spaceship and the satellite. Since they're moving together due to the connection through the rope, their relative velocity is zero. We can consider them as a single object with total mass `M = m_ship + m_satellite = 960 kg` (where `m_ship` is the mass of the spaceship and `m_satellite` is the mass of the satellite). Newton's second law states that `F = ma`, where `F` is the net force, `m` is the mass, and `a` is the acceleration. In our case, the only external force acting on the system is the force from the spaceship pulling the satellite, so `F` should equal the net force:\n\n\\[ F_{net} = M * a \\]\n\nSince the spaceship is accelerating, `a > 0`. Substituting the given values for `M` and `a` gives us:\n\n\\[ F_{net} = 960 \\, kg * 5 \\, m/s^2 = 4800 \\, N \\]\n\nThe force exerted by the spaceship on the rope is half of this value because it acts over half the length of the rope since both ends are attached to the spaceship and satellite. So,\n\n\\[ F_{rope} = \\frac{F_{net}}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{4800}{2} \\,N = 2400 \\,N } \\]\n\n(b) Now let's find the tension in the rope. Tension is defined as the force applied by one object onto another across a point of contact. Here, there are two points of contact between the rope and each vessel, but since the forces at these points must be equal and opposite due to action-reaction principle, we can focus on just one point of contact. Let `T` denote the tension in the rope. Applying Newton's second law to either the spaceship or the satellite, we get:\n\n\\[ T - F_{rope} = M * a \\]\n\nSubstitute the known values into the equation above:\n\n\\[ T - 2400 \\,N = 960 \\,kg * (-1)\\, m/s^2 \\]\n\nSolving for `T` gives us:\n\n\\[ T = 2400 \\,N + 960 \\,kg * (-1)\\, m/s^2 = \\boxed{3456 \\,N} \\]\n\n(c) When the acceleration changes to deceleration (negative acceleration), the tension in the rope will also change its direction while maintaining the same magnitude until the satellites come to a stop. As the spaceship slows down, the distance between the ships and the angle formed by the rope with the horizontal plane increases. This causes the centripetal force required to keep the rope taut to increase according to the formula `F_centripetal = m*v^2 / r`, where `r` is the radius of the circular path described by the satellite during deceleration. If the deceleration continues without any adjustments, eventually the tension in the rope won't be enough to counteract the centrifugal force, causing the rope to stretch or even break if the material isn't strong enough. Additionally, when the rope breaks, the satellite would continue moving forward under gravity, potentially colliding with other objects in space.", "final_answers": ["\\frac{4800}{2} \\,N = 2400 \\,N", "3456 \\,N"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{4800}{2} \\,N = 2400 \\,N", "expr2": "5000 \\, \\text{N}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "3456 \\,N", "expr2": "5000 \\, \\text{N}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "3456 \\,N", "expr2": "5000 - 5x \\, \\text{N}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "3456 \\,N", "expr2": "10 \\, \\text{s}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.5}

Using Newton's second law again, we get $\\frac{d\\mathbf{J}}{dt}=m(\\dot{\\mathbf{R}}\\times F(\\|\\mathbf{R}-\\mathbf{R}'\\|)\\hat{u}_{\\mathbf{R}})=0$, since $\\hat{u}_{\\mathbf{R}}$ is always perpendicular to $\\dot{\\mathbf{R}}$, due to the central nature of the force. This shows that the angular momentum is conserved.\n\nKepler's second law states that a planet moves such that the line joining the planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times. In our case, the area swept out by one particle in a small time interval $dt$ is proportional to $|\\mathbf{v}\\times d\\mathbf{l}|$, where $\\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity of the particle and $d\\mathbf{l}$ is the displacement during $dt$. However, since the motion lies in a plane, we can express $d\\mathbf{l}$ as $d\\mathbf{l}=\\dot{\\mathbf{R}} dt$. Furthermore, because the angular momentum is conserved, we know that $|\\mathbf{J}|=mR^2\\dot{\\theta}$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\mathbf{R}$ and $\\dot{\\mathbf{R}}$. Therefore, $|\\mathbf{v}\\times d\\mathbf{l}|=(md\\theta)/(mt)=d\\theta$, which proves Kepler's second law.\n\n(b) For the harmonic oscillator potential ($V = kr^2/2$), the equation of motion becomes $\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} + k\\mathbf{r} = 0$. Separating variables and solving the resulting differential equations yields solutions of the form $r(t) = A\\cos(kt+\\phi)$, where $A$ and $\\phi$ are constants determined by initial conditions. To find the extreme values of $r$, set $\\dot{r}=0$:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dot{r} &= -kA\\sin(kt+\\phi)\\\\\n0 &= -kA\\sin(kt+\\phi)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\sin(kt+\\phi)&=0\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThis happens when $kt+\\phi=n\\pi$, where $n$ is an integer. Solving for $t$, we obtain the times at which $r$ reaches its extremes:\n\n\\[\nt_n = -\\frac{n\\pi}{k}+\\frac{\\phi}{k}\n\\]\n\nTo find the corresponding values of $r$, substitute these times back into the expression for $r$:\n\n\\[\nr_n = A\\cos\\left[-\\frac{n\\pi}{k}+\\frac{\\phi}{k}\\right]\n\\]\n\nThese are the minimum and maximum values that $r$ will have in the course of the motion.", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

We can treat the Earth as a rotating disk for simplicity, ignoring its spherical shape. The stone experiences two types of acceleration: centripetal acceleration due to the Earth's rotation (which keeps it moving along the circular path) and radial acceleration due to its own linear motion (which causes it to move towards the center).\n\nLet's denote the angular speed of the Earth as $\\omega_0$, the distance between Buffalo and Olaflub as $L=2R$, and the radius of the Earth as $R$. When dropped, the stone moves with the same tangential speed as the Earth at the surface ($v_\\text{tangent} = R\\omega_0$), but no radial component since it starts from rest. In order to reach Olaflub in half the original time, the stone needs to travel twice the average speed during each half of the journey.\n\nFor the first half of the journey, the stone has only the tangential speed provided by the Earth's rotation. For the second half, when the stone is falling radially towards the center, its total speed is the sum of the tangential speed and the radial speed. Since the stone falls under gravity, its radial acceleration is given by $a_\\text{radial}=g$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

Let $\\theta$ be the angle between the direction of motion of the source and the line connecting the source and the observer. We will consider three cases:\n\ni) Approaching case: Source and observer moving towards each other. In this case, $\\theta = 0$. Applying the Lorentz transformation, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nct' = \\gamma(ct - vx)\\\\\nx' = \\gamma(x -vt)\\\\\ny' = y\\\\\nz' = z\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nFor the light emitted from the source, its frequency remains unchanged in the source frame, i.e., $\\nu_0$. However, due to the Doppler shift, the observed frequency changes according to:\n\n\\[ f' = \\frac{\\Delta t'}{\\Delta t'}f_0 = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t'}f_0 = \\frac{1}{t'} \\cdot \\frac{c}{w'} = \\frac{c}{w'\\Delta t'}, \\]\n\nwhere $w'$ is the distance traveled by the light in the primed frame during one oscillation period. Since the speed of light is constant in all frames, we have $c = w'/\\Delta t'$. Now, use the Lorentz transformation for the spatial coordinates to relate $w'$ and $\\Delta t'$:\n\n\\[ w' = \\gamma(w - v\\Delta t') \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Delta t' = \\gamma(\\Delta t - vw'). \\]\n\nSubstitute these expressions into the formula for the observed frequency:\n\n\\[ f' = \\frac{c}{w'\\Delta t'} = \\frac{c}{\\gamma^2[(w - v\\Delta t')(\\Delta t - vw')]} = \\frac{c}{\\gamma^2[w(\\Delta t - vw') - v(\\Delta t)'w']}. \\]\n\nNotice that $(\\Delta t)' = \\gamma(\\Delta t - vw')$. Substituting it back into the expression for $f'$, we get:\n\n\\[ f' = \\frac{c}{\\gamma^2[w(\\Delta t - vw') - v\\gamma(\\Delta t - vw')w']} = \\frac{c}{\\gamma^2[w\\Delta t - vw'(1+\\gamma)]} = \\frac{c}{\\gamma^2[w\\Delta t - v\\Delta t/(1-\\beta^2)]}, \\]\n\nsince $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}$. Simplify further to arrive at the desired result:\n\n\\[ f' = \\nu_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\beta}{1 - \\beta}}. \\]\n\nii) Receding case: Source and observer moving away from each other. Here, $\\theta = \\pi$. Following similar steps as before, but now applying the Lorentz transformation for negative values of $x'$, we find:\n\n\\[ f' = \\nu_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\beta}{1 + \\beta}}. \\]\n\niii) Perpendicular case: Source and observer moving past each other orthogonally. In this situation, $\\theta = \\pi/2$. From part (a), we know that the magnitude of the momentum 4-vector is invariant under Lorentz transformations, so $|p| = |p'_x| + |p'_y| + |p'_z|$. For photons, their momentum has only the time component, which corresponds to the energy divided by $c$:\n\n\\[ |p|^2 = \\left(\\frac{E}{c}\\right)^2 = (p'_x)^2 + (p'_y)^2 + (p'_z)^2 = \\left(\\frac{E'}{c}\\right)^2 + p'_y^2 + p'_z^2. \\]\n\nSince there is no change in the y or z components, we have:\n\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{E}{c}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{E'}{c}\\right)^2 + p'_y^2 + p'_z^2. \\]\n\nRecall that $E' = \\gamma(E - vpc_x)$ and $p'_y = p_y$. Also, since the source and observer are moving perpendicularly, the x-component of the momentum vanishes, i.e., $p_x = 0$. Thus, we have:\n\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{E}{c}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{E'}{c}\\right)^2 + p'_y^2 + p'_z^2 = \\left(\\frac{E'}{c}\\right)^2 + p'_y^2. \\]\n\nSquare root both sides to obtain:\n\n\\[ E = \\pm \\sqrt{(E')^2 + (cp'_y)^2} = \\pm \\sqrt{(E')^2 + (cp_y)^2}, \\]\n\nsince $p'_y = p_y$. Finally, substitute the expression for $E'$ derived earlier:\n\n\\[ E = \\pm \\sqrt{(\\gamma^2(E - vpc_x))^2 + (cp_y)^2} = \\pm \\gamma\\sqrt{(E - vpc_x)^2 + (cp_y)^2}. \\]\n\nIn the present scenario, the minus sign applies because the observer measures a lower frequency than the source. Therefore, the observed frequency becomes:\n\n\\[ f' = \\frac{E}{h} = -\\frac{\\gamma}{h}\\sqrt{(E - vpc_x)^2 + (cp_y)^2}. \\]\n\nHowever, since the source emits light in all directions, the y-component of the momentum averages out to zero over many emissions. So, we can approximate $p_y \\approx 0$. Then, simplifying the expression for $f'$, we get:\n\n\\[ f' = \\frac{\\gamma}{h}(E - vpc_x) = \\frac{\\gamma}{hc}(mc^2 - vpc_xt) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}\\frac{1}{tc}\\left(1 - \\frac{v}{c}t\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}\\frac{1}{tc}\\left(1 + \\frac{v}{c}t\\right), \\]\n\nsince $E = mc^2$ for a photon. Notice that the term inside the square root can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[ 1 + \\frac{v}{c}t = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}(1-\\beta)\\frac{ct}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}} = \\frac{ct}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}, \\]\n\nwhich leads to the following expression for the observed frequency:\n\n\\[ f' = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}\\frac{1}{tc}\\frac{ct}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}} = \\frac{1}{(1-\\beta^2)t} = \\frac{1}{(1-\\beta^2)}\\frac{c}{w}, \\]\n\nwhere $w$ is the distance between the source and the observer. Since the distance between them does not change, we have $w = w_0$. Hence, the final result is:\n\n\\[ f' = \\frac{\\nu_0}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}. \\]", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "mechanics/1_45", "solution": " To show that the orbit is stable, we need to demonstrate that the total energy of the system is negative, which indicates a bound or stable state. The total energy of a particle moving in a circular orbit can be expressed using its kinetic energy ($K$) and potential energy ($U$). In our case, the potential energy is due to the centripetal force required to maintain the circular motion:\n\n1. Kinetic Energy (KE): For a particle with mass $m$, moving at constant speed $v = \\omega r$, where $\\omega$ is the angular velocity, the kinetic energy is given by:\n   \\[\n   KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m (\\omega r)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m r^2 \\omega^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Potential Energy (PE): Since the force acting on the particle is centripetal, the potential energy can be defined such that the net work done by the force during one complete circle is zero. This means that the change in PE over a full cycle should equal the total work done by the force, which is zero for a conservative force like gravity. However, since we're only interested in the sign of the total energy, it doesn't matter what specific form we choose for the PE; all that matters is that it has opposite signs compared to the kinetic energy.

We can then approximate the energies of the vibrational modes using perturbation theory. For simplicity, let's focus on the lowest vibrational mode (\\(n=1\\)). In this limit, the energy levels of the unperturbed harmonic oscillator are given by \\(E_{n}=\\hbar\\omega_{0}(n+\\frac{1}{2})\\), where \\(\\omega_{0}=\\sqrt{k/m}\\) is the natural angular frequency of the oscillator.\n\nWhen the electric and magnetic fields are present, the energy levels shift slightly due to their interaction with the charge.

Instead, the particle could experience cyclotron motion in the presence of the magnetic field or accelerate radially outward due to the electric field. However, calculating exact solutions in this regime requires numerical methods beyond the scope of this response.\n\nIn summary, the vibration frequencies of a charged particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential under the simultaneous action of uniform magnetic and electric fields can be found by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in cylindrical coordinates and separating variables.

According to this principle, a body will appear to be motionless if it is located directly over its gravitational center. Since the space station remains vertically above the same point on Earth, that means it must be hovering over the Earth's center of mass.\n\nThe Earth is approximately an oblate spheroid with a slightly flattened polar axis compared to the equatorial radius. The Earth's center of figure (the point where the sphere would balance) lies about 10 mm below the geometrical center along the polar axis. However, for practical purposes, we can consider the geometrical center as the Earth's center of mass since the difference is negligible when considering large objects like a space station.\n\nNow let us describe the orbit of the space station:\n\n1. Orbit type: The space station orbits around the Earth in a circular geostationary orbit.

Inclination angle: Geostationary satellites have zero inclination because they orbit exactly in the plane of the Earth's equator.\n\n3. Right ascension of the ascending node (Ω): For a geostationary satellite, the right ascension of the ascending node (Ω) is fixed at 0 degrees or 360 degrees, depending on the reference frame used. In other words, the satellite's orbital plane coincides with the equatorial plane.\n\n4. Argument of perigee (ω): For a geostationary satellite, the argument of perigee (ω) is also fixed at either 0 or 180 degrees, again depending on the reference frame used. It doesn't matter what value we choose here since the satellite does not have a perigee or apogee due to being in a circular orbit.\n\n5. Mean anomaly (M): The mean anomaly (M) changes continuously as the satellite moves through its orbit. However, for a geostationary satellite, M increases linearly with time at a rate of one revolution every sidereal day (which is slightly shorter than a solar day due to the Earth's rotation on its own axis).\n\nIn summary, the space station is located over the Earth's geometric center, and it follows a circular geostationary orbit with zero inclination, a constant longitude of 0 or 360 degrees, and a linear increase in mean anomaly at a rate of one revolution per sidereal day.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{{Location}: Earth's Center of Mass} \\\\ \\text{{Orbit Type}}:\\text{{Circular Geostationary Orbit}} \\\\ \\text{{Inclination Angle}}:\\text{{Zero Degrees}} \\\\ \\text{{Right Ascension of the Ascending Node ($\\Omega$)}:} \\text{{Fixed at 0 or 360 degrees}} \\\\ \\text{{Argument of Perigee ($omega$)}}:\\text{{Fixed at 0 or 180 degrees}} \\\\ \\text{{Mean Anomaly ($M$)}}:\\text{{Linear Increase at a Rate of One Revolution per Sidereal Day}}} \\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{{Location}: Earth's Center of Mass} \\\\ \\text{{Orbit Type}}:\\text{{Circular Geostationary Orbit}} \\\\ \\text{{Inclination Angle}}:\\text{{Zero Degrees}} \\\\ \\text{{Right Ascension of the Ascending Node ($\\Omega$)}:} \\text{{Fixed at 0 or 360 degrees}} \\\\ \\text{{Argument of Perigee ($omega$)}}:\\text{{Fixed at 0 or 180 degrees}} \\\\ \\text{{Mean Anomaly ($M$)}}:\\text{{Linear Increase at a Rate of One Revolution per Sidereal Day}}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{{Location}: Earth's Center of Mass} \\\\ \\text{{Orbit Type}}:\\text{{Circular Geostationary Orbit}} \\\\ \\text{{Inclination Angle}}:\\text{{Zero Degrees}} \\\\ \\text{{Right Ascension of the Ascending Node ($\\Omega$)}:} \\text{{Fixed at 0 or 360 degrees}} \\\\ \\text{{Argument of Perigee ($omega$)}}:\\text{{Fixed at 0 or 180 degrees}} \\\\ \\text{{Mean Anomaly ($M$)}}:\\text{{Linear Increase at a Rate of One Revolution per Sidereal Day}}", "expr2": "\\text{The observer is at a point on the equator.

{"id": "mechanics/1_98", "solution": " To solve this problem, we will use Newton's second law and consider both the radial and tangential components of the coin's acceleration. The radial component will cause the change in the coin's radial velocity, while the tangential component will keep the coin moving along the circular path of the disk.\n\n1. Let us first find the centripetal force required to keep the coin moving in a circle:\n   - The centripetal force acting on the coin is given by \\(F_c = mr\\omega^2\\).\n   - Since there is no friction between the coin and the disk, the net external force acting on the coin must be zero. So, the force exerted by the person pushing the coin towards the origin should equal the centripetal force: \\(F_{person} = F_c\\).\n\n2. Now let us find the initial radial velocity of the coin after being pushed:\n   - Initially, the coin has only tangential velocity \\(V\\) relative to the disk. However, as soon as it starts moving radially, its total velocity becomes \\(v=\\sqrt{V^2+R^2\\dot{\\theta}^2}\\), where \\(\\dot{\\theta}=\\omega\\) is the angular velocity of the disk. At this point, the radial velocity is \\(v_r=v\\cos\\phi-R\\omega\\), where \\(\\phi\\) is the angle between the direction of the initial velocity vector and the radius vector from the rotation axis to the coin. Since the coin was initially moving purely tangentially, \\(\\phi=\\pi/2\\), so \\(v_r=-V + R\\omega\\).\n\n3. Next, we need to find the acceleration of the coin during the small time interval \\(t\\):\n   - The radial acceleration is given by \\(a_r = -\\frac{v_r}{t}\\). Substituting our expression for \\(v_r\\) yields \\(a_r = \\frac{-(V-R\\omega)}{t}\\).\n   - During the short time interval considered, the tangential acceleration can be neglected because \\((\\omega t)^2\\) is assumed to be negligible. Thus, the tangential speed remains approximately constant, i.e., \\(a_\\theta = 0\\).\n\n4. As the coin moves under the influence of the radial acceleration, its position changes according to the equations of motion:\n   - For the radial component: \\(r(t)=r_0+\\int v_rdt = r_0-\\frac{(V-R\\omega)}{t}t\\).

{"id": "mechanics/1_76", "solution": " (a) To prove that the motion of the particle lies in a plane, we can use the cross product property of vectors: if two non-zero vectors are always perpendicular to each other, then their cross product is zero. Here, the force acting on the particle is always parallel or antiparallel to its position vector, which means they are either collinear or orthogonal. If they were collinear for some instant, the magnitude of the force would be zero, contradicting our assumption that it never vanishes due to the negative sign in front of \\(K\\). Therefore, the force must be orthogonal to the position vector at all times, implying that the motion takes place in a plane containing both \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{F}\\).\n\n(b) We have initial conditions given as follows:\n\\[ x(0) = a,\\quad y(0) = 0,\\quad v\\_x(0) = 0,\\quad v\\_y(0) = V \\]\nWe will solve these equations using Newton's second law with the given force expression:\n\\[ F\\_x = ma\\_x'' = -Kx \\\\ F\\_y = ma\\_y'' = - Ky \\]\nNow let us assume that the motion occurs along the x-axis first, so initially there is no acceleration in the y direction (\\(y''=0\\)). Solving for \\(x''\\):\n\\[ x'' = -\\frac{K}{m}x \\]\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n\\[ x(t) = A\\cosh{\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{m}} t\\right)} + B\\sinh{\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{m}} t\\right)} \\]\nSince \\(x(0)=a\\), we find \\(A=a\\).

Thus,\n\\[ x(t) = a\\cosh{\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{m}} t\\right)} \\]\nNext, consider the motion in the y direction. Since \\(x(t)\\) has been found already, we know that the particle moves only horizontally when \\(y=0\\). So, during this horizontal motion, there is no vertical component of the force (\\(F\\_y=0\\)), meaning that the acceleration in the y direction remains zero (\\(y''=0\\)) throughout this part of the motion. Now integrating twice gives:\n\\[ y(t) = Ct + D \\]\nUsing the condition \\(y(0)=0\\), we obtain \\(D=0\\).

This allows us to approximate the rate of interactions as a continuous flow of particles. In one second, there are $10^6$ interactions, so the number of interactions occurring within a small time interval $\\mathrm{d}t$ is approximately $(10^6)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$. Each interaction transfers a momentum $\\Delta p = p_{brick}$ to the brick, so the net transferred momentum per unit time is $(\\Delta p)(10^6)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$.

{"id": "mechanics/1_70", "solution": " (a) For a circular orbit, the particle moves with constant speed along a circular path of radius `R`. The centripetal acceleration `a_c` required to keep the particle moving in a circle is given by `a_c = v^2 / R`, where `v` is the velocity of the particle. Since the force acting on the particle is directed radially inward and has magnitude equal to the centripetal force, we have:\n\n\\[f(R) = m\\frac{v^2}{R} \\tag{1}\\]\n\nTo achieve a circular orbit initially, we need to choose the initial conditions such that equation (1) holds true. This means choosing an initial velocity `v` so that it satisfies:\n\n\\[v = \\sqrt{\\frac{f(R)}{m}} \\tag{2}\\]\n\n(b) To determine the stability condition for a circular orbit, consider a small radial displacement `Δr` from the equilibrium position (the center of the circle). The new position of the particle will be described by `r = R + Δr`. We can expand the force function around `R` using Taylor series up to second order terms as follows:\n\n\\[f(r) \\approx f(R) + (r-R)\\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r}\\right|_R + \\frac{(r-R)^2}{2!}\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial r^2}\\right|_R\\]\n\nSince our original circular orbit satisfies equation (1), we can rewrite the above expression as:\n\n\\[f(r) \\approx -\\frac{mv^2}{r} + v^2\\left(\\frac{r}{R}-1\\right)\\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r}\\right|_R + \\frac{mv^4}{(2R)}\\left(\\frac{r}{R}-1\\right)^2\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial r^2}\\right|_R\\]\n\nFor the circular orbit to be stable, any small radial displacements should lead to restoring forces pointing towards the center of the circle. In other words, the net force on the particle due to the radial displacement should be negative when `Δr > 0` and positive when `Δr < 0`. This implies that the coefficient of `Δr` in the expanded force function should be negative. Thus, we require:\n\n\\[\\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r}\\right|_R < 0 \\tag{3}\\]\n\nThis shows that the force must decrease with increasing distance for a stable circular orbit.\n\n(c) Now let's find the maximum value of `n` for which the circular orbit can be stable according to the force law `f(r) = -K/r^n`. First, note that the force becomes singular at `r=0`, so we exclude this case. Also, since the force decreases with increasing distance, we want to maximize `n` while still satisfying inequality (3):\n\n\\[\\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r}\\right|_{R>0} = n\\frac{K}{R^{n+1}} < 0 \\implies n > -1 \\]\n\nThus, the maximum value of `n` for which the circular orbit can be stable is `n=-1`, but this corresponds to a Coulomb force between two charged particles, not a central force. Therefore, no finite value of `n` results in a stable circular orbit for the given force law. However, if we allow for a repulsive component in addition to the attractive one, then there exists a range of values for `n` for which stable circular orbits can occur. But that would go beyond the scope of your question.\n\nIn summary, we found that:\n\n* A circular orbit can result by properly choosing initial conditions (equation (2)).\n* For a stable circular orbit, the force must decrease with increasing distance (inequality (3)).\n* No finite value of `n` leads to a stable circular orbit for the given force law `f(r) = -K/r^n`.", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

Let's denote the angle covered by the mass during its motion as `θ`. Since the mass moves along the circumference of the wheel, we have:\n\n`theta = omega * t`\n\nNow let's consider the tangential velocity of the mass. Initially, when the mass was glued to the wheel, it had the same linear velocity as the wheel, which is given by `R*omega`. After the glue breaks, the mass starts moving away from the center of the wheel while maintaining the same angular speed `omega`, so its linear velocity changes according to the radial distance from the center. We can express the linear velocity of the mass using the chain rule:\n\n`v_linear = d(R*theta)/dt = R*d(theta)/dt + theta*d(R)/dt = R*omega + theta*(0) = R*omega`\n\nSince the mass maintains a constant angular speed `omega`, its linear velocity remains equal to `R*omega`. Now, let's calculate the length of the unwound string at any given moment. Denote the initial length of the wound-up string as `L_initial`. As the mass moves radially outward, the length of the unwound string increases. Let `r` be the current radial position of the mass. Then, the length of the unwound string is given by:\n\n`L(t) = L_initial - r`\n\nWe want to find the derivative of `L(t)` with respect to time `t`.

However, since we are interested in the increase of the unwound string, we should take the absolute value of the derivative:\n\n`|frac{d}{dt}(L(t))| = |-R*omega| = R*omega`\n\nThis result holds true regardless of whether the mass moves in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction because the mass always maintains the same linear velocity `R*omega`.

Recall that the radial acceleration is approximately constant throughout the orbit, so we can take it out of the integral when computing the mean anomaly:\n\n\\[M=\\int_{f}^{f+T}\\sqrt{\\mu^2e^2-\\frac{h^2}{\\rho^2}}\\,\\mathrm d\\theta,\\]\n\nwhere \\(f\\) represents the true anomaly corresponding to the periapsis, \\(\\mu=\\frac{GM}{a}\\), \\(e\\) is the eccentricity, \\(h\\) is the specific angular momentum, and \\(\\rho\\) is the instantaneous distance between the planet and the focus of the ellipse. By approximating the orbit as a circle, we set \\(e=0\\), making the above expression simplify to:\n\n\\[M=\\int_{f}^{f+T}\\sqrt{\\mu^2-\\frac{h^2}{\\rho^2}}\\,\\mathrm d\\theta.\\]\n\nWe now expand the integrand up to linear order in \\(e\\):\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nM&\\approx\\int_{f}^{f+T}\\left(\\mu-\\frac{h^2}{2\\rho^2}\\right)\\,\\mathrm d\\theta\\\\\n&=\\mu T - \\frac{h^2}{2R},\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\nsince the average value of \\(\\frac{1}{\\rho^2}\\) over the orbit is equal to \\(\\frac{1}{R^2}\\). Now we differentiate \\(M\\) with respect to time:\n\n\\[\\dot{M}=\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial e}\\dot{e}+\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial h}\\dot{h}.\\]\n\nRecall that the energy conservation law states that the sum of kinetic and potential energies is constant, i.e.,\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{2}mv^2-\\frac{GMm}{r}=E,\\]\n\nwhere \\(v\\) is the speed of the planet, \\(r\\) is the instantaneous distance between the planet and the star, and \\(E\\) is the total energy. Taking the derivative with respect to time yields:\n\n\\[\\dot{E}=\\frac{\\mathrm dv}{\\mathrm dt}\\cdot v + \\frac{\\mathrm dr}{\\mathrm dt}\\cdot\\frac{GMm}{r^2}.\\]\n\nUsing the approximation that the radial acceleration is constant, we get:\n\n\\[\\dot{E}\\approx -\\frac{GMma}{R^3}+Av.\\]\n\nNotice that the left side of the above equation is zero because the total energy is conserved. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[Av=- \\frac{GMma}{R^3}.\\]\n\nSolving for \\(v\\), we obtain:\n\n\\[v=\\sqrt{\\frac{GMa}{R^3}-A}.\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the derivative of \\(v\\) with respect to time:\n\n\\[\\dot{v}=\\frac{\\mathrm dv}{\\mathrm dt}=\\frac{-3GMam}{2R^4}-\\frac{Ar}{v}.\\]\n\nNow we can express the derivatives of \\(M\\) with respect to \\(e\\) and \\(h\\):\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial e}&=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial e}\\int_{f}^{f+T}\\sqrt{\\mu^2-\\frac{h^2}{\\rho^2}}\\,\\mathrm d\\theta\\\\\n&=-\\frac{h^2}{2R^2}\\int_{f}^{f+T}\\frac{\\mathrm d\\theta}{\\rho^2}\\\\\n&=-\\frac{h^2}{2R^2}\\int_{f}^{f+T}\\frac{\\mathrm d\\theta}{(R+r)^2}\\\\\n&=-\\frac{h^2}{2R^5}\\int_{f}^{f+T}\\frac{(R+r)}{r}\\,\\mathrm d\\theta\\\\\n&\\approx-\\frac{h^2}{2R^5}\\int_{f}^{f+T}\\left(1+\\frac{r}{R}\\right)\\,\\mathrm d\\theta\\\\\n&\\approx-\\frac{h^2}{2R^5}\\int_{f}^{f+T}\\mathrm d\\theta\\\\\n&=-\\frac{h^2}{2RT}.\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\nSimilarly, we have:\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial h}&=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h}\\int_{f}^{f+T}\\sqrt{\\mu^2-\\frac{h^2}{\\rho^2}}\\,\\mathrm d\\theta\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{f}^{f+T}\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{\\mu^2-\\frac{h^2}{\\rho^2}}}\\frac{\\mathrm dh}{\\mathrm d\\rho}\\frac{\\mathrm d\\rho}{\\mathrm d\\theta}\\,\\mathrm d\\theta\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{f}^{f+T}\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{\\mu^2-\\frac{h^2}{\\rho^2}}}r\\,\\mathrm d\\theta.\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(r=R-ae\\cos f\\) into the above integral, we get:\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial h}&=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{f}^{f+T}\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{\\mu^2-\\frac{h^2}{\\rho^2}}}(R-ae\\cos f)\\,\\mathrm d\\theta\\\\\n&\\approx\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{f}^{f+T}\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{\\mu^2}}(R-ae\\cos f)\\,\\mathrm d\\theta\\\\\n&=\\frac{hR}{2\\sqrt{\\mu^2}}T-\\frac{hae}{2\\sqrt{\\mu^2}}\\int_{f}^{f+T}\\cos f\\,\\mathrm d\\theta.\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for \\(\\dot{M}\\), \\(\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial e}\\), and \\(\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial h}\\) back into the equation for \\(\\omega_p\\):\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega_p&=\\frac{\\dot{M}}{t}\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{t}\\left[-\\frac{h^2}{2RT}+\\frac{hR}{2\\sqrt{\\mu^2}T}\\dot{e}+\\frac{hae}{2\\sqrt{\\mu^2}T}\\int_{f}^{f+T}\\cos f\\,\\mathrm d\\theta\\right]\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{T}\\left[-\\frac{h^2}{2R}+\\frac{hR}{2\\sqrt{\\mu^2}}(\\ddot{e}T)+\\frac{hae}{2\\sqrt{\\mu^2}}\\int_{f}^{f+T}\\cos f\\,\\mathrm d\\theta\\right],\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\nwhere we used the fact that \\(\\dot{t}=0\\).

{"id": "mechanics/1_48", "solution": " (a) The physics principles that apply to the motion of the heavy meteorite after its collision include conservation of linear momentum and energy conservation. These principles ensure that the change in velocity (and thus the change in kinetic energy) of the heavy meteorite due to the collision will be balanced by an equal but opposite change in the velocity of the lighter meteorite. Since the total mass remains constant and the direction of motion does not change, these two principles can be used to analyze the situation.\n\n(b) After the collision, the meteorite continues moving along the same circular path as before because no external forces have been applied to change its trajectory. However, since it has lost some of its kinetic energy, its speed decreases, causing the radius of its orbit to increase slightly so that the centripetal force required for maintaining the circular motion is still provided by Earth's gravitational pull. This means that the new orbit is larger than the original one.\n\n(c) To find the meteorite's distance of closest approach ($r_f$) after the collision, we first need to calculate its new orbital speed ($v_f$).
