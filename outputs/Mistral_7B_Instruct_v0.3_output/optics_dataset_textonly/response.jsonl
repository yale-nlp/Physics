However, since we only want the maximum possible distance `d`, we set `v` equal to infinity, resulting in:\n\n   \\[ d = \\frac{rf}{r^2-\\lambda f} \\]\n\n2. Intensity: According to the Huygens-Fresnel principle, the intensity distribution around the focus due to a single point source can be described by the Airy disk function:\n\n   \\[ I(\\theta) = I_0\\left[ \\frac{J_1(ka\\sin\\theta)}{ka\\sin\\theta} \\right]^2 \\]\n\n   where `I_0` is the intensity without the opaque sheet, `a` is the diameter of the aperture (twice the radius `r`), `k` is the wave number ($k=2\\pi/\\lambda$), and $\\theta$ is the angle between the ray and the axis passing through the center of the aperture and the focus. At the maximum distance `d` found above, the angle $\\theta$ corresponds to the half-angle subtended by the aperture at the screen, i.e., $\\theta=\\arctan{(a/2d)}$. Plugging this into the Airy disk function, we calculate the intensity of the bright spot.\n\nFinal Answer: \\[\\boxed{d = \\frac{rf}{r^2-\\lambda f}, \\; I(\\text{spot}) = I_0\\left[ \\frac{J_1(ka\\tan^{-1}{(a/(2d))})}{ka\\tan^{-1}{(a/(2d))}} \\right]^2 }\\]"}
{"id": "optics/1-24", "questions": "﻿Find and describe a combination of two converging lenses which produces an inverted, virtual image at the position of the object and of the same size. By a sketch of image formation make it clear that your scheme will work.\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": " To create a combination of two converging lenses that produce an inverted, virtual image at the same size and position as the object, we can use a telecentric system with one lens acting as an objective (L1) and another as an eyepiece (L2). This configuration is often used in microscopes to maintain parallel rays after passing through the objective, ensuring no magnification or distortion.\n\nHere's how you set up this system:\n\n1. Choose appropriate focal lengths for L1 and L2 such that their combined power equals zero, i.e., 1/f_total = 1/f_obj - 1/f_eye = 0. In other words, f_obj * f_eye = f_total^2, where f_obj is the focal length of the objective lens, f_eye is the focal length of the eyepiece, and f_total is the total distance between the objective and the eyepiece.\n\n2. Place the object at the focal point of the objective lens (F1), so the incoming light rays diverge from there.\n\n3. The divergent rays then pass through the objective lens, bending them towards each other until they meet again at the second focus of the objective lens (F2). At this point, the rays are still diverging but have not yet reached the eyepiece.\n\n4. Now place the eyepiece at F2, so the diverging rays enter its first focus and bend back toward the viewer. Since the eyepiece has positive power, these rays now converge once more before reaching the final focus of the eyepiece.\n\n5. The final focus of the eyepiece coincides with the original location of the object due to the choice of focal lengths made earlier. As a result, the image formed by the eyepiece appears inverted, virtual, and the same size as the object.\n\nSketch of Image Formation:\n\n```\n                     +-----------------+\n

The first minimum occurs when $n=1$. So we have:\n\n\\[ sin(\\theta_1) = \\frac{\\lambda}{w} \\]\n\nSince $w \\gg \\lambda$, we can approximate $sin(\\theta_1) \\approx \\theta_1$:\n\n\\[ \\theta_1 = \\frac{\\lambda}{w} \\]\n\nThis shows that the direction of the first minimum on either side of the central maximum is indeed given by $\\theta = \\lambda/w$.\n\n(b) To resolve two parallel lines, the angle between them should be equal to or greater than the angular resolution of the system. The angular resolution ($\\Delta\\theta$) of a telescope is given by:\n\n\\[ \\Delta\\theta = \\frac{1.22\\lambda}{D}, D >> \\frac{d}{\\Delta d} \\]\n\nwhere $D$ is the diameter of the aperture, $d$ is the separation of the objects being observed, and $\\Delta d$ is their smallest resolvable difference. In this case, since we want to resolve parallel lines one kilometer apart ($d = 10^6 \\ m$), we have $\\Delta d = d = 10^6 \\ m$. Since the lines are parallel, there's no need to consider $\\Delta d$ here. Also, since the distance of the moon is much larger than the object separation ($400,000 \\ km > 10^6 \\ m$), we can use the above formula without worrying about the condition $D >> \\frac{d}{\\Delta d}$. Substituting the values into the formula gives us:\n\n\\[ D = \\frac{1.22\\lambda d}{\\Delta\\theta} = \\frac{1.22 * 500*10^{-9} * 10^6}{1.22*\\frac{1.22*500*10^{-9}}{400,000}} = \\boxed{38.7 \\ m} \\]\n\nSo the aperture needs to be approximately 38.7 meters wide to resolve parallel lines one kilometer apart on the surface of the moon from Earth."}

We have already found the condition for the first wavelength (\\(\\lambda_1\\)) to get diffracted back along itself as follows:\n\n\\[\\lambda_1 = 2d\\]\n\nTo see whether the second wavelength (\\(\\lambda_1/2\\)) can also satisfy the same condition, we compare its value with the above result:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\lambda_1}{2} = \\frac{2d}{2} = d\\]\n\nIn this case, both \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_1/2\\) will be diffracted back along themselves since they share the same grating line spacing (\\(d\\)). However, note that only one wavelength will be diffracted into the backward direction due to the selection rule which states that the order number must be even or odd for forward and backward directions respectively. In our case, the order number for both wavelengths is zero, so neither of them will be diffracted back along itself. Instead, they will be diffracted in different orders (even or odd). This means that while it is theoretically possible for both wavelengths to be present, they cannot be separated through this simple grating configuration without additional components such as filters or another grating with a different line spacing.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{{Monochromatization is not achievable with this specific grating configuration for the given wavelengths}} } \\]"}

In our case, let D be the diameter of the lens, d be the distance between the observer and each star, and θ be the given angular separation:\n\n\\theta = 2 * (distance / Diameter) => Diameter = (2 * distance) / theta\n\nSince the distances to the stars are usually very large compared to the Earth-Moon distance (approximately 384,400 km), we can consider them as being infinitely far away. This means that the angles they subtend remain constant regardless of their actual distance. So, we can rewrite the equation above using the known value of θ:\n\nDiameter = (2 * infinity) / (1 x 10^-6 radians) = 2 * (1/[1 x 10^-6]) m = 200,000 meters or about 200 kilometers.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that such a large telescope size is impractical due to various constraints like cost, available technology, and atmospheric turbulence.\n\n(b) For separating the two wavelengths with a diffraction grating, we need to understand that the diffraction grating will cause the different wavelengths to spread out according to the grating equation:\n\nnλ = d sin θ\n\nwhere n is the order of diffraction, λ is the wavelength, d is the grating constant (the reciprocal of the number of lines per millimeter on the grating), and θ is the angle of deviation from the incident beam. Since we want to separate the two wavelengths, we set up an equation system for the two wavelengths:\n\n5770Å * sin θ_1 - 5790Å * sin θ_2 = 0\n\nWe know that the difference in angles (Δθ) between the two wavelengths should be greater than the resolving power of the human eye, which is approximately 0.00028 arcseconds or about 5 x 10^-9 radians. We can now express the condition for resolution as:\n\nsin θ_1 - sin θ_2 > 5 x 10^-9 radians\n\nTo find the required grating constant 'd', we first need to isolate one of the sine functions and then substitute the values for the wavelengths and desired minimum angle difference into the equation. Solving for 'd' would give us the necessary grating constant for separating the two wavelengths. However, without knowing specific details about the grating, such as its efficiency and line density, it is difficult to calculate an exact numerical value for the grating size. Nonetheless, you can estimate the grating size based on the calculated grating constant 'd'."}

Since the central disk has no transmission, its contribution to the total intensity is zero. Therefore, only the outer three zones contribute to the total intensity.\n\nLet \\(I_0\\) be the intensity of the incident wave.

In reality, the actual intensity will depend on the phase differences among the diffracted orders, leading to possible destructive interference and reducing the overall intensity. Nevertheless, our approximation provides a rough estimate of the order of magnitude of the intensity at the focus.\n\n(c) Intensity maxima occur when the path length difference between different diffracted orders is an integer multiple of half the wavelength.

In this process, shorter wavelengths of light such as blue and violet are scattered more than longer wavelengths like red or yellow due to their smaller wavelengths interacting with air molecules (mainly nitrogen and oxygen).

This phenomenon occurs because of two factors: atmospheric scattering and Earth's atmosphere acting as a filter. As the sun moves towards the horizon, its rays have to pass through more layers of the earth's atmosphere, causing them to be scattered sideways more often. Shorter wavelengths get scattered out, leaving behind longer wavelengths that make the sun look red. Additionally, ozone layer absorption contributes to the removal of some blue light from the spectrum reaching us.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{{Red sun at sunset results from atmospheric scattering and Earth's atmosphere acting as a filter, removing shorter wavelengths (like blue) and allowing longer wavelengths (like red) to reach our eyes.}}}\\]\n\n(c) The Rainbow\nA rainbow forms when sunlight interacts with water droplets present in the atmosphere after rainfall. Each water droplet acts as a miniature prism, refracting, reflecting, and dispersing sunlight into different colors according to their respective wavelengths.

Light from distant stars passes through various layers of the atmosphere before reaching our eyes. These layers contain air molecules and particles that cause the starlight to bend and change direction, leading to fluctuations in apparent star positions and brightness over time – known as stellar scintillation or twinkling. Furthermore, changes in temperature and density within the Earth's atmosphere can also contribute to the twinkling effect.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{{Twinkling of stars arises from the bending and changing direction of starlight passing through Earth's atmosphere, causing variations in apparent star positions and brightness.}}}\\]"}

Here's a simplified explanation of its working:\n\n1. A photon enters the PMT through a window and strikes a photosensitive material called a photocathode. The photocathode emits electrons when it absorbs a photon with sufficient energy (typically ultraviolet or visible light).\n2. These emitted electrons are accelerated towards a series of dynodes due to a high voltage applied across them. Each dynode further multiplies the number of electrons via secondary emission, where each incoming electron ejects multiple electrons from the dynode surface.\n3. The resulting electron cascade exiting the last dynode (anode) carries enough charge to produce a measurable electrical pulse proportional to the initial photon's energy.\n\nRegarding your question about distinguishing between two photons with different energies, yes, a PMT can do so because the output electrical pulse size is directly related to the incident photon's energy according to Planck's equation E = hν, where E is the energy, h is Planck's constant, and ν is the frequency of the photon. Since the frequencies of the two photons differ by 50%, their energies will also differ, leading to distinct electrical pulses for each photon type. However, precise measurements may require additional calibration and noise reduction techniques.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{{A Photomultiplier Tube can distinguish between two photons whose energies differ by 50%, provided there is adequate resolution to measure the differences in the generated electrical pulses.}} }\\]"}

However, it should be noted that the actual value may not match any of the provided options exactly due to rounding errors.\n\n(b) To calculate the energy flux of sunlight at Earth's orbit, we need to know the solar constant and the distance between the Sun and Earth. The average solar constant is around 1367 W/m², and the mean distance between the Sun and Earth is roughly 1 AU (approximately 149.6 million kilometers or 149600000000 cm).

Ozone (O$_3$) absorbs ultraviolet radiation but its dissociation products (O and O$_2$) absorb some visible light as well.

Ozone (O$_3$) plays a crucial role here, as it absorbs most of the harmful UVB and UVC radiation before they reach the Earth's surface.

First, let's consider the Sun as our source of light with a luminosity L (power emitted per unit solid angle). The solar radius R_sun determines the area A_sun from which sunlight reaches us: A_sun = πR_sun².\n\n2. When the Sun's rays pass through the lens, they form an image on the focal plane. Since the lens forms an real image, the size of the image will be smaller than the actual size of the Sun. Let d be the distance between the center of the Sun and the lens, and i be the linear magnification produced by the lens. Then, the diameter of the image D_image = i * d / R_sun.\n\n3. Now, let I_0 be the initial intensity of light reaching the lens from the Sun. According to the inverse square law, the intensity decreases as it travels away from the source. So, the intensity after passing through the lens can be calculated as I = I_0/(d/f)² since the distance from the lens to the focal point is f.\n\n4. Next, we need to find out how much power P passes through the image area on the focal plane. We know that Power = Intensity × Area. In this case, the area of the image is A_image = π(D_image/2)² = πi²(d/R_sun)²/4.\n\n5. Substituting the expression for I into the equation for Power, we get P = I_0*(4f²/d²)/[πi²(d/R_sun)²].

Equate the two radii:\nSince we want the diffraction blur to be equal to the defocus blur, we set the Airy disk radius equal to the Circle of Confusion:\n\\[\nr_d = \\text{{Circle of Confusion}}\n\\]\nSolving for the Numerical Aperture, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{{Numerical Aperture}} = \\frac{r_d}{\\frac{1.22 \\lambda}{r_d}} = \\frac{1.22 \\lambda}{r_d}\n\\]\nPlugging in the known values, we find:\n\\[\n\\text{{Numerical Aperture}} = \\frac{1.22 * 550 \\times 10^{-9}}{1.6 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 0.0036\n\\]\n\nFinally, since the Numerical Aperture depends on the stop opening through the F-number ($F=\\frac{f}{D}$) where $D$ is the diameter of the aperture, we can rearrange the above expression to find the desired aperture:\n\\[\n\\text{{Aperture Diameter}} = \\frac{f}{\\text{{Numerical Aperture}}} = \\frac{60 \\,\\text{mm}}{0.0036} \\approx 16670\\,\\text{mm}\n\\]\nTaking the square root of the diameter gives us the aperture width:\n\\[\n\\text{{Aperture Width}} = \\sqrt{(16670)^2} \\approx 129\\,\\text{mm}\n\\]\nHowever, since apertures are usually measured in fractions of their full diameter, we convert the result into f-stops:\n\\[\n\\text{{F-Stop}} = \\log_{2}(\\text{{Aperture Ratio}}) = \\log_{2}(129/100) \\approx 1.9\n\\]\n\nIn summary, the aperture (stop opening) that makes the diffraction blur equal to the defocus blur for a star at infinity is approximately an f-stop of 1.9, which corresponds to an aperture width of about 129 mm.\n\n\\[\\boxed{f-\\text{{Stop}} = 1.9}\\]"}

Explain how you could use a large-aperture telescope lens or mirror, together with a laser and a short-focus lens to get a beam with very small divergence. What would the characteristics of the telescope lens and short-focus lens have to be to get a beam of angular width $10^{-6}$ radian (first minimum on one side to first minimum on the other)? You may assume a rectangular aperture at the objective if you wish. \n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": " To achieve a laser beam with a small angular width of $10^{-6}$ radians, we can use two optical components: a large-aperture telescope lens or mirror for collimation (reducing the beam's divergence), followed by a short-focus lens for further focusing and narrowing down the beam. Let's analyze each component and their required specifications.\n\n**Telescope Lens/Mirror:** The primary function of this component is to collect as much light as possible and focus it into a parallel beam. A larger aperture will allow more light collection, but the size of the aperture is limited by the available resources and the diffraction limit. For our case, let's consider a circular aperture diameter D. The angular resolution (or the ability to resolve two points as separate) of a telescope is given by the Rayleigh criterion:\n\n\\[\\theta_R = \\frac{1.22 \\lambda}{D} \\]\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the laser light. We want the angular width of the output beam to be equal to or smaller than the angular resolution, so:\n\n\\[10^{-6} \\text{rad} \\geq \\frac{1.22 \\lambda}{D} \\]\n\nSolving for the diameter D gives us:\n\n\\[D \\geq \\frac{1.22 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{rad} \\times \\lambda}{\\pi} \\]\n\nFor simplicity, let's take the HeNe laser wavelength ($\\lambda=632.8nm$) as an example. Plugging in the value, we find that:\n\n\\[D \\geq \\frac{7.94 \\times 10^{-9}}{\\pi} m \\approx 2.5 mm\\]\n\nSo, the telescope lens or mirror should ideally have a diameter greater than approximately 2.5mm to meet the desired angular width requirement.\n\n**Short-Focus Lens:** After passing through the telescope lens, the beam still has some residual divergence. The short-focus lens serves to further reduce the beam's divergence and increase its intensity. The angular spread of the beam after passing through a lens is related to its focal length ($f$), entrance pupil diameter ($D$), and the wavelength ($\\lambda$). Using the Airy disk formula, we can calculate the angular width of the central maximum:\n\n\\[\\theta_{max} = \\frac{1.22 \\lambda}{D} (\\frac{D^2}{4f^2}+1)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\]\n\nTo minimize the angular width while keeping the same diameter D, we need to choose a shorter focal length. However, reducing the focal length increases the magnification, which might make alignment difficult. Therefore, finding the optimal focal length requires balancing these factors.\n\nIn conclusion, to obtain a laser beam with an angular width of $10^{-6}$ radians using a large-aperture telescope lens or mirror and a short-focus lens, follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a telescope lens or mirror with a diameter greater than about 2.5mm.\n2.

Let's solve them one by one.\n\n**(a)** Molecular scattering occurs because electrons within molecules oscillate in response to the applied electric field of light. The polarization of the molecule induces a dipole moment which then radiates energy, causing scattering. Since the electric polarizability is frequency-independent, it means that the induced dipole moment is proportional to the strength of the electric field, but not its frequency. However, the electric field strength varies with the inverse cube of distance and depends on the angle between the direction of propagation and the observation point. As a result, the intensity of scattered light will depend on both the wavelength and the angle of observation. For perpendicular incidence, the intensity of scattered light is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength (Rayleigh scattering law):\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{I(\\theta)}{I_0} = \\frac{A}{r^4} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\omega^4}{c^4}\\right)\\cdot P^2 \\cdot (\\cos^2\\theta + \\frac{1}{3})}, \\]\n\nwhere \\(I(\\theta)\\) is the intensity of scattered light at an angle \\(\\theta\\), \\(I_0\\) is the incident light intensity, \\(A\\) is a constant depending on the properties of the scatterer, \\(P\\) is the polarizability of the molecule, \\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency of light, \\(c\\) is the speed of light, and \\(r\\) is the distance from the source.

Therefore, even though individual molecules may scatter some fraction of the incoming light, the overall effect is negligible, resulting in no net scattering.\n\n**(c)** With fluctuations in the number of molecules, the effective cross section becomes:\n\n\\[C_{eff} = C_n \\sqrt{N_0 \\Delta V},\\]\n\nand the net scattering intensity becomes:\n\n\\[I_{net}(\\theta) = -F \\cdot S \\cdot C_{eff}^2.\\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for \\(C_{eff}\\) gives:\n\n\\[I_{net}(\\theta) = -\\frac{I_0}{c} \\cdot S \\cdot \\left(\\frac{8 \\pi^3}{3} N_0 \\cdot |p|^4 \\right)^2 \\cdot N_0 \\Delta V.\\]\n\nNotice that the net scattering intensity scales linearly with the number of molecules, indicating that each molecule scatters independently without any interference between molecules.\n\n**(d)** At high relative humidity, water vapor molecules become more abundant in the air.

On the other hand, in long wavelength optics (near 5000 Å), which includes the visible spectrum, refraction is less pronounced because the index of refraction is lower. Therefore, conventional glass lenses can be used effectively.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{{Lens usage differs significantly depending on the wavelength: X-ray optics require specialized materials while visible light uses conventional glasses.}}}\\]\n\n(b) **Use of Mirrors:**\nFor both short and long wavelengths, mirrors play a crucial role in reflection and focusing. However, the reflectivity varies greatly. For X-rays, metals like gold, silver, and aluminum have higher reflectivity compared to visible light. In addition, X-ray mirrors often use multilayered coatings to enhance their reflective properties. Conversely, for visible light, highly polished metal mirrors or dielectric mirrors made from multiple layers of transparent materials can be used.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{{Mirror usage remains important but reflects differently based on wavelength: Metallic mirrors are common for X-rays, while dielectric mirrors and metallic ones are used for visible light.}}}\\]\n\n(c) **Chromatic Resolving Power of Gratings of Fixed Width**\nThe chromatic resolving power of a grating depends on its rule, groove density, and wavelength. As the wavelength decreases, the required groove density increases to maintain the same resolving power. Since it's challenging to fabricate very fine structures for shorter wavelengths, the chromatic resolving power of gratings tends to decrease when moving towards X-rays. In comparison, gratings for visible light can be more easily manufactured with finer lines, resulting in better chromatic resolving power.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{{Chromatic resolving power of gratings generally decreases as we move towards shorter wavelengths since manufacturing challenges increase.}}}\\]\n\n(d) **Minimum Resolvable Angular Separation of an Image-Forming System of Fixed Diameter**\nThe minimum resolvable angular separation, or Rayleigh criterion, depends on the wavelength and the diameter of the lens/aperture. Shorter wavelengths allow for smaller angles to be resolved, meaning a higher resolution. Thus, for a given diameter, the minimum resolvable angle is smaller for X-rays than for visible light.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{{The minimum resolvable angular separation decreases as we move towards shorter wavelengths for a fixed diameter.}}}\\]"}

This is true for both light (photons) and sound (mechanical waves). For photons, this requires them to behave as if they have no definite position until measured, a phenomenon known as wave-particle duality.\n\n2. **Coherence**: The waves must also be coherent, meaning their phase difference remains constant over time. Incoherent sources produce waves that do not maintain a consistent phase relationship, resulting in no observable interference patterns. Coherence can be achieved through various means such as using lasers for light sources instead of common lamps or ensuring the sound sources vibrate at the same frequency.\n\n3. **Superposition Principle**: The principle of superposition states that the resultant displacement of a point due to multiple forces acting on it is equal to the vector sum of the individual displacements. Similarly, for waves, the total disturbance at any point is the algebraic sum of the disturbances caused by each wave separately. This allows us to observe constructive and destructive interference.\n\n4. **Path Difference**: Interference occurs when the crests and troughs of the waves align or misalign, leading to constructive or destructive interference respectively. This depends on the path length difference between the two waves. If the path lengths differ by an integer number of wavelengths, constructive interference results; otherwise, we get destructive interference.\n\nIf all these conditions are satisfied, the observer should be able to see or hear the interference pattern produced by the separated independent pairs of light or sound generators.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{{An observer can directly sense interference effects from separate independent pairs of light or sound generators when the waves exhibit wave-like behavior, are coherent, follow the superposition principle, and there exists a suitable path difference between the waves.}}}\\]"}

However, we know the values of `D`, `y4`, `λ`, and `n`.

Magnification for the conventional telescope (with a converging eyepiece):\nThe total focal length ($F$) of this telescope is the sum of the objective lens's focal length ($f_o$) and the converging eyepiece's focal length ($f_e$). Using the magnification formula:\n\\[ M = -\\frac{F}{f_o} \\]\n2. Magnification for the unconventional telescope (with a diverging eyepiece):\nIn this case, the effective focal length ($F'$) of the telescope is the difference between the objective lens's focal length ($f_o$) and the absolute value of the diverging eyepiece's focal length ($|f_d|$).

Finally, if we want to compare the physical lengths of the telescopes, remember that the focal length is related to the physical length through the diameter ($D$) via $f = \\frac{D^2}{8}$.

This increased resolution allows astronomers to see finer details and make more accurate observations compared to shorter telescopes with the same magnification."}
