We can use Ampere's law for a solenoid:\n\n∇ × **B** = μ₀J\n\nwhere J is the current density, and here it's equivalent to the charge density times the velocity (since the motion is sinusoidal):\n\nJ = ρv = σE = ε₀ω² E cos(ωt) (due to displacement current)\n\nSince the electric field is perpendicular to the plates and constant within each plate, its only nonzero component is Ez. Also, since the problem states that the electric field is uniform, the magnetic field must be radial (r-component), and azimuthal (φ-component) components should vanish due to symmetry. Thus, we have:\n\n∂Bᵥ/∂r = μ₀σε₀ω² E cos(ωt)\n\nTo find B(r), integrate both sides with respect to r:\n\n∫∂Bᵥ/∂r dr = μ₀σε₀ω² ∫ Ez dr\n\nThe integral on the right side evaluates to -Q/2πε₀, where Q is the total charge on one plate.

{"id": "electro/3_4", "solution": " To determine if the wire will melt, we need to calculate the current flowing through it during the discharge process and compare that with the melting point temperature's corresponding heat input rate.\n\nFirst, let's find the total capacitance (C) of four 1 microfarad capacitors in parallel:\n\\[ C_{total} = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + C_4 \\]\n\\[ C_{total} = 1\\mu F + 1\\mu F + 1\\mu F + 1\\mu F = 4\\mu F \\]\n\nNext, let's find the charge (Q) on each capacitor before they are disconnected:\n\\[ Q = C * V \\]\n\\[ Q = 4\\mu F * 200V = 800\\mu C \\]\n\nSince all capacitors have equal charges, when they are disconnected, each capacitor will release $800\\mu C$ of charge. The total charge released is $3200\\mu C$.\n\nNow, let's find the voltage across each capacitor after they are disconnected since they are now isolated from each other:\n\\[ V = \\frac{Q}{C} \\]\n\\[ V = \\frac{800\\mu C}{4\\mu F} = 200V \\]\n\nThe total energy stored in the system can be calculated as follows:\n\\[ U = \\frac{1}{2} * C * V^2 \\]\n\\[ U = \\frac{1}{2} * 4\\mu F * (200V)^2 = 80J \\]\n\nThis energy will be dissipated as heat while the wire conducts the current. Let's assume that all the energy is transferred to the wire. We know the wire's resistance (R), so we can calculate the time taken for the energy transfer using Ohm's law:\n\\[ t = \\frac{U}{I*R} \\]\nwhere I is the current flowing through the wire.\n\nTo find the current, we first need to convert the wire's dimensions into meters:\n\\[ L = \\frac{5mm}{1000} m = 0.005m \\]\nSo the wire's total resistance is:\n\\[ R = 4\\Omega/m * 0.005m = 0.002\\Omega \\]\n\nWe don't have enough information to directly solve for the current (I). However, we can estimate whether or not the wire will melt based on its resistivity ($\\rho$) and the critical power density ($P_c$). Copper's resistivity is approximately $\\rho=1.68\\times10^{-8}\\Omega m$, and its melting point is around $T_m=1083K$. The critical power density corresponds to the power required to raise the temperature of the material uniformly without any significant thermal gradients leading to melting. For copper, this value is roughly $P_c=\\frac{\\rho c_p}{\\alpha}$, where $c_p$ is specific heat capacity (approximately $c_p=0.385 J/(g K)$ for copper) and $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity (about $\\alpha=90\\times10^{-6}m^2/s$ for copper). Plugging these values into the equation gives us:\n\\[ P_c = \\frac{(1.68\\times10^{-8}\\Omega m)(0.385 J/(g K))}{(90\\times10^{-6}m^2/s)} = 7.04\\times10^{6} W/(m^3) \\]\n\nAssuming that all the energy goes into heating the wire evenly, we can approximate the maximum allowable current as:\n\\[ I = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{P_c * A}{\\rho}} \\]\nwhere A is the cross-sectional area of the wire. Calculating the cross-sectional area of the wire requires knowing its diameter, but given that it's \"fine,\" we can make an educated guess that the diameter might be around 1 millimeter (which would give a reasonable order of magnitude result). With this assumption, the cross-sectional area becomes:\n\\[ A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi(0.001m)^2 = 3.14\\times10^{-6}m^2 \\]\nPlugging this value back into our expression for the current gives:\n\\[ I = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{(7.04\\times10^{6} W/(m^3))(3.14\\times10^{-6}m^2)}{(1.68\\times10^{-8}\\Omega m)}} = 1.15\\times10^3A \\]\n\nFinally, let's check if the actual current flowing through the wire exceeds this estimated safe limit. Recall that the total energy available is 80 joules, and the wire's total resistance is 0.002 ohms. Using Ohm's law again, we get:\n\\[ I = \\frac{U}{R} = \\frac{80J}{0.002\\Omega} = 40kA \\]\n\nComparing this value with our estimated safe limit shows that the actual current flowing through the wire significantly exceeds the safe limit, which means there is a high probability that the wire will melt during the discharge process.\n\nIn summary, the wire will likely melt due to the large amount of current passing through it during the discharge process.\n\n\\[\\boxed{Yes, the wire will most likely melt.} \\]", "final_answers": ["Yes, the wire will most likely melt."], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "Yes, the wire will most likely melt.", "expr2": "\\text{The copper wire will not melt.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Thus, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\na_L = a_B = 0\\\\\na_1 = -\\frac{c}{K} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z}\\\\\na_2 = -\\frac{c}{K} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n(c) $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} - \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t} = 0$:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{\\partial B_3}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial B_2}{\\partial z} - \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{\\partial E_1}{\\partial t} = 0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial B_1}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial B_3}{\\partial x} - \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{\\partial E_2}{\\partial t} = 0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial B_2}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial B_1}{\\partial y} - \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{\\partial E_3}{\\partial t} = 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nFrom part (b), we know that $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}=0$, so this equation reduces to:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{\\partial B_3}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial B_2}{\\partial z} = 0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial B_1}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial B_3}{\\partial x} = 0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial B_2}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial B_1}{\\partial y} = 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nThese three equations imply that the magnetic field has cylindrical symmetry around the z-axis. In other words, the magnetic field depends only on radial distance r and azimuthal angle phi.\n\n(d) $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = 0$: From part (b), we already found that $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}=0$, which implies that $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}=0$ as well. No additional constraint is needed.\n\n(e) The parameter $a_L$ corresponds to the longitudinal polarization along the direction of propagation (z-axis), while the rest of the parameters correspond to transverse polarizations perpendicular to the direction of propagation. These polarizations are not affected by gauge transformations because they do not involve time dependence or spatial gradients of the scalar potential. On the other hand, the longitudinal polarization can change under a gauge transformation due to its explicit time dependence. Therefore, $a_L$ is gauge dependent.\n\n(f) After imposing conditions (a)-(d), we have $a_L=a_B=0$ and $a_1, a_2$ related to the gradient of some arbitrary functions $g(x), g(y)$.

{"id": "electro/2_9", "solution": " (a) The magnetic field inside a long air-core solenoid can be calculated using Ampere's Law, which states that the line integral of B around any closed loop is equal to μ₀ * I enclosed by the loop. For our case, since the solenoid is long, we can consider a circular path with radius r within the solenoid. The enclosed current is then given by n * πr² * i_0 * sin(\\omega t). Using this, we can write the magnetic field as:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{B}(r,t) = \\mu\\_0 \\cdot n \\cdot i\\_0 \\cdot \\sin(\\omega t) \\cdot \\int\\_0^r dr' \\frac{1}{2\\pi r'} = \\frac{\\mu\\_0 \\cdot n \\cdot i\\_0 \\cdot r \\cdot \\sin(\\omega t)}{2}\n\\]\n\nwhere r is the radial position within the solenoid.\n\n(b) Now let us find the electric field inside and outside the solenoid. We will first assume there is no free charge present, so we need to calculate the displacement current density D. Inside the solenoid, the magnetic field changes with time, so there is a displacement current. Outside the solenoid, the magnetic field is constant and equal to zero, so there is no displacement current.\n\nInside the solenoid ($r < b$), Maxwell's equation relating E and D is:\n\n\\[\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}}{\\partial t} = -\\mu\\_0 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\n\\]\n\nSince D = ε₀ * E and B = (μ₀ / 2) * n * i_0 * r * cos(\\omega t), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} - \\varepsilon\\_0 \\cdot \\varepsilon\\_r \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\mu\\_0 \\cdot n \\cdot i\\_0 \\cdot r \\cdot \\cos(\\omega t)}{2}\n\\]\n\nHere, ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, and ε\\_r is the relative permittivity of the material inside the solenoid. Assuming the solenoid is filled with air (ε\\_r = 1), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} - \\varepsilon\\_0 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\mu\\_0 \\cdot n \\cdot i\\_0 \\cdot r \\cdot \\cos(\\omega t)}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis is a differential equation for the electric field inside the solenoid. To solve it, we would need additional boundary conditions or assumptions about the symmetry of the problem. However, without further information, we cannot obtain a specific analytical solution.\n\nOutside the solenoid ($r > b$), the magnetic field is zero, so there is no displacement current, and Maxwell's equation reduces to:\n\n\\[\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = 0\n\\]\n\nThe electric field outside the solenoid must satisfy Laplace's equation, which describes the electrostatic potential V:\n\n\\[\n\\nabla^2 V = 0\n\\]\n\nFor a cylindrical geometry like this one, the general solution to Laplace's equation is:\n\n\\[\nV(r,\\theta,z) = f(r) \\cdot g(\\theta) \\cdot h(z)\n\\]\n\nWhere f(r), g(\\theta), and h(z) are arbitrary functions. Since the electric field is radially symmetric (no dependence on θ or z), only the function f(r) remains:\n\n\\[\nV(r) = f(r)\n\\]\n\nTo determine f(r), we could use another boundary condition such as the continuity of the electric field at the surface of the solenoid. But again, without more information, we cannot obtain a specific analytical solution.\n\nSketching the electric field lines:\nSince we don't have exact solutions for the electric fields inside and outside the solenoid, we cannot draw precise sketches. However, we know that the electric field lines should originate/terminate at charges and point away from positive charges and towards negative ones. In our case, there are no free charges present, but the changing magnetic field induces displacement current, creating an electric field distribution. Inside the solenoid, the electric field lines should be concentrated near the axis due to the presence of the induced current. Outside the solenoid, the electric field lines should be uniformly distributed because there is no net charge or current.\n\nGraphing the magnitude of E at t = 2π/ω:\nWithout knowing the specific form of the electric field inside and outside the solenoid, we cannot plot its magnitude directly. However, based on our discussion above, we expect the electric field inside the solenoid to depend on both the radial position r and time t through terms like r * sin(ωt) and r * cos(ωt). At t = 2π/ω, these trigonometric functions will take different values depending on the location within the solenoid. Therefore, the electric field inside the solenoid may exhibit complex spatial variations that cannot be represented by a simple graph. Similarly, outside the solenoid, the electric field should be relatively constant over space and time, but we still lack enough information to create a meaningful graph.", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "electro/4_21", "solution": " (a) We will start by finding the relations between the fields using Maxwell's equations. Since we have a non-conducting and non-permeable medium, only two of Maxwell's equations are independent: Gauss' law for electricity and Faraday's law of induction.\n\nGauss' law for electricity states that the divergence of the electric field equals the charge density, but since our medium has no free charges, this equation simplifies to:\n\n∇⋅E = 0\n\nFaraday's law of induction relates the time derivative of the magnetic field to the curl of the electric field:\n\n∇×E = -∂B/∂t\n\nNow let us apply these equations to our problem. The wave equation for the electric field can be obtained by taking the curl of Faraday's law and then applying Gauss' law:\n\n∇²E - k^2 E = 0\n\nHere, k is the magnitude of the wavevector K, defined as |K| = ω/c. To solve this equation, we need boundary conditions. Given that the wave propagates in the z-direction, we assume that the components of the electric field depend on z only:\n\nE_x(z,t) = Ex(z) e^{-iωt}\nE_y(z,t) = Ey(z) e^{-iωt}\nE_z(z,t) = Ez(z) e^{-iωt}\n\nPlugging these expressions into the wave equation, we get three ordinary differential equations for Ex(z), Ey(z), and Ez(z). However, due to the symmetry of the problem, it turns out that Ez(z) must vanish because there is no component of the electric field parallel to the direction of propagation and the gyration vector. Thus, we have:\n\nEx(z) = A cos(kz)\nEy(z) = B sin(kz)\n\nThe boundary condition for these solutions comes from requiring continuity across the interface between air and the gyrotropic material. At the interface, the tangential components of both E and D should match. Using the relation between D and E provided earlier, we obtain:\n\nA cos(kz) + B g sin(kz) = 0\n\nThis equation implies that either A or B must be zero, depending on the value of k. If k satisfies the following transcendental equation:\n\ntan(kL) = -gk\n\nthen A = 0, and the wave is called extraordinary; otherwise, if k does not satisfy this equation, then B = 0, and the wave is called ordinary. Here L is the thickness of the slab of gyrotropic material.\n\nTo find the index of refraction N, we use the fact that the phase velocity vp = ω/k. In vacuum, c = ω/k0, so we have:\n\nvp = c / N\n\nSince the speed of light is constant in vacuum, the index of refraction depends solely on the properties of the gyrotropic material:\n\nN = c / vp = c * k / ω\n\nFor the extraordinary wave, we have k = sqrt((g^2+1)^2)/L^2, while for the ordinary wave, k = sqrt(1/L^2). Substituting these expressions into the formula for N gives us the possible values for the index of refraction in terms of the constants ε and g:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{cases}\nN_\\text{extraordinary} = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{(g^2+1)^2}/L^2 \\omega} & \\text{if } tan(kL) = -\\frac{g}{k}\\\\\nN_\\text{ordinary} = \\frac{c}{1/L^2 \\omega} & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n}\n\\]\n\n(b) Now let us find the polarization of the electromagnetic wave for each case. Recall that the Poynting vector S = E × H, where H is the magnetic field. Since we have a non-permeable medium, the magnetic field inside the gyrotropic material is simply equal to the magnetic field outside the material, which is given by B0.\n\nIn the case of the extraordinary wave, the electric field is perpendicular to the direction of propagation and the gyration vector, meaning that the electric field lies in the x-y plane. Let us choose the coordinate system such that the electric field points along the y-axis. Then, we have:\n\nE_x = 0\nE_y = E0\nE_z = 0\n\nUsing the expression for the electric displacement D, we can write down the relationship between the electric field and the magnetic field:\n\nD_x = ε E_x + ig E_z = 0\nD_y = ε E_y + ig E_z = B0\nD_z = ε E_z + ig E_z = 0\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we find that:\n\nE_y = B0/(ε + ig)\n\nSubstitute the expression for the index of refraction found in part (a):\n\n\\[\nE_{y,\\text{extraordinary}} = \\frac{B_0}{(\\epsilon + ig)\\left(\\frac{c}{\\sqrt{(g^2+1)^2}/L^2 \\omega}\\right)}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, for the ordinary wave, the electric field is parallel to the direction of propagation and the gyration vector, meaning that the electric field also lies along the z-axis. Again choosing the coordinate system such that the electric field points along the z-axis, we have:\n\nE_x = 0\nE_y = 0\nE_z = E0\n\nFollowing the same steps as before, we find that:\n\n\\[\nE_{z,\\text{ordinary}} = \\frac{B_0}{\\epsilon \\left(\\frac{c}{1/L^2 \\omega}\\right)}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{cases}\nN_\\text{extraordinary} = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{(g^2+1)^2}/L^2 \\omega} & \\text{if } tan(kL) = -\\frac{g}{k}\\\\\nN_\\text{ordinary} = \\frac{c}{1/L^2 \\omega} & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{cases}\nN_\\text{extraordinary} = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{(g^2+1)^2}/L^2 \\omega} & \\text{if } tan(kL) = -\\frac{g}{k}\\\\\nN_\\text{ordinary} = \\frac{c}{1/L^2 \\omega} & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}", "expr2": "N_1 = \\sqrt{\\epsilon + g}, \\quad N_2 = \\sqrt{\\epsilon - g}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{cases}\nN_\\text{extraordinary} = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{(g^2+1)^2}/L^2 \\omega} & \\text{if } tan(kL) = -\\frac{g}{k}\\\\\nN_\\text{ordinary} = \\frac{c}{1/L^2 \\omega} & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}", "expr2": "E_{0x} = iE_{0y}, \\quad E_{0z} = 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{cases}\nN_\\text{extraordinary} = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{(g^2+1)^2}/L^2 \\omega} & \\text{if } tan(kL) = -\\frac{g}{k}\\\\\nN_\\text{ordinary} = \\frac{c}{1/L^2 \\omega} & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}", "expr2": "E_{0x} = -iE_{0y}, \\quad E_{0z} = 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

In this case, we have vacuum ($Z_1=1$) as the incident medium and glass ($Z_2=\\sqrt{\\mu\\epsilon}$) as the transmitted medium. Since the wavevector is perpendicular to the surface, the permittivity ($\\epsilon$) and permeability ($\\mu$) are related to the speed of light in each medium via $\\epsilon = c^2/\\nu^2$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum and $\\nu$ is the phase velocity in the medium.\n\nFor glass with index of refraction $n$, its phase velocity $\\nu$ is given by $\\nu = c/n$.

At the interface between two media, some of the energy will be reflected while the rest will be transmitted. The net power absorbed or emitted by the interface is zero due to conservation of energy. Therefore, the total power incident on the interface must equal the sum of the powers reflected and transmitted:\n\n\\[ P_{incident} = P_{reflected} + P_{transmitted} \\]\n\nSince the power is proportional to the energy flux density, we can write:\n\n\\[ \\frac{I}{c} = R * \\frac{I}{c} + T * \\frac{I}{c} \\]\n\nSolving for the reflected power gives us:\n\n\\[ P_{reflected} = R * \\frac{I}{c} \\]\n\nThe force exerted by the radiation pressure on the plate is given by the time rate of change of momentum transferred to the plate. The momentum carried by one photon is hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and λ is the wavelength of the light. Since there are N photons per unit volume, the force per unit area (pressure) exerted on the plate is:\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{d}{dt}(Nhc/λ) = \\frac{Nhc}{λ} \\frac{dN}{dt} \\]\n\nHowever, since the number of photons does not change over time, dN/dt = 0. Thus, the radiation pressure becomes:\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{Nhc}{λ} \\cdot 0 = 0 \\]\n\nThis result seems counterintuitive because it suggests no radiation pressure should act on the plate even though energy is being reflected off the surface. This apparent paradox arises from our assumption that the plate is stationary; if the plate were moving, there would indeed be a nonzero radiation pressure according to the Lorentz force law. However, neglecting any motion of the plate, we cannot derive a finite value for the radiation pressure based solely on the properties of the electromagnetic wave and the material interface.", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

For approximating such a field using filamentary currents, imagine infinitely long wires running along the positive and negative $x$-axis carrying equal but opposite currents ($I_1=-I_2$), as shown below:\n\n```\n    _______________\n   |              |\n   |      I_1     |\n   |              |\n   |              |\n   |              |\n   |              |\n   |      I_2     |\n   |              |\n   |--------------|\n         ^        |\n         |        |\n          R      O\n```\n\n(c) Magnetic Flux per Unit Length in the $\\hat{z}$-direction between the origin and the field line whose minimum distance from the origin is $R$:\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field on the circle centered at the origin with radius $R$ is $B=\\left|\\mathbf{B}\\right|=\\frac{B_0}{a}|x|=\\frac{B_0}{a}R$. Since the angle subtended by the circular arc at the center is $2\\pi$, the total magnetic flux enclosed by the circle is $\\Phi_M = BA = \\frac{2\\pi B_0 R^2}{a}$. Now, dividing by the length of the circle ($2\\pi R$) gives us the magnetic flux per unit length:\n\n\\[\n\\phi_M = \\frac{\\Phi_M}{2\\pi R} = \\frac{B_0 R}{a}.\n\\]\n\n(d) Electric Potential:\nIn a static magnetic field, there is no electric field, so the electric potential is constant everywhere. However, if you want to calculate the difference in electric potential between two points $(x, y)$ and the origin, use the formula for electrostatic potential in cylindrical coordinates:\n\n\\[\nV(\\rho,\\varphi,z) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\int\\frac{\\rho'}{r^3} \\ dQ',\n\\]\nwhere $dQ'$ represents an elemental charge located at $(\\rho',\\varphi',z')$, and $r$ is the distance between the charges and the point of interest. In our case, there are no charges present, so the integral evaluates to zero, meaning the electric potential is constant and equal to zero throughout the entire region.\n\n(e) Slowly Varying Magnetic Field and Electric Field:\nA changing magnetic field induces an electric field according to Faraday's law. In Cartesian coordinates, the induced electric field is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial t},\n\\]\nwhere $\\mathbf{A}$ is the vector potential associated with the magnetic field. For a magnetic field of the form $\\mathbf{B}=\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$, the vector potential can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi}\\int\\frac{\\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{r}',t)}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|^2} \\ d^3 r'.\n\\]\n\nAssuming that the current density $\\mathbf{J}$ varies slowly in time, we can expand the vector potential around its equilibrium value:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\mathbf{A}_0(\\mathbf{r})+\\delta\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r},t),\n\\]\nwhere $\\mathbf{A}_0(\\mathbf{r})$ corresponds to the steady state solution, and $\\delta\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r},t)$ contains the time-dependent perturbations. Substituting this into the expression for the magnetic field yields:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{A}_0(\\mathbf{r})+\\delta\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r},t)) \\approx \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}_0(\\mathbf{r}) + \\nabla \\times \\delta\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r},t).\n\\]\n\nNow, assuming that the changes in the magnetic field occur over distances much larger than the characteristic scale length of the system, we can neglect the spatial derivative term in the time-dependent part of the vector potential:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r},t) \\approx \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}_0(\\mathbf{r}) - \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t}(\\nabla \\times \\delta\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r},t)).\n\\]\n\nComparing this expression with Faraday's law, we find that the induced electric field is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r},t) = -\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t}(\\nabla \\times \\delta\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r},t)),\n\\]\nwhich depends on the time variations of the current distribution responsible for generating the original magnetic field.", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

The charge element `dq` located at a position with an angle `θ` from the z-axis will have an infinitesimally small area `dA = r² sin(θ) dΩ`, where `dΩ` represents the solid angle subtended by `dq` as seen from the center of the sphere. Thus, the charge contained within this infinitesimal area is `dq = σ * dA = (Q/(4πr²)) * r²sin(θ) dΩ`.\n\nNow let us consider the distance `dr` between the charge element `dq` and the test charge `q₀` placed at the origin (the center of the sphere). Since both charges lie on the same line passing through the center of the sphere, their separation vector is simply `r + dr`.

Now, since the charge distribution is symmetric around the z-axis, there should be no net torque or angular momentum generated when moving the test charge along the z-axis. This implies that the forces must always act radially and perpendicular to the z-axis. Therefore, the component of the force parallel to the z-axis must vanish, which means $\\cos(\\theta)=0$, i.e., the charge element lies directly on the line connecting the centers of the two charges. In this case, the force acts either towards or away from the test charge depending on whether the charge elements carry positive or negative charges.\n\nFor simplicity, assume that all charges involved are positive. Then, the force on the charge element `dq` points away from the test charge `q₀`.

As a result, the dot product inside the parentheses vanishes, leaving us with:\n\n$$\ndF_{\\text{radial}} = 0.\n$$\n\nThis seems counterintuitive because we expect some nonzero force to exist. However, recall that we assumed all charges were positive. If instead, we had considered a negatively charged charge element `dq`, the resulting force would have pointed toward the test charge, leading to a nonzero radial component.\n\nTo account for both cases, we take the absolute value of the force, which ensures that the sign depends on the relative orientation of the charges:\n\n$$\n|dF_{\\text{radial}}| = |\\frac{k {q}_{0}|dq|}{r^3}(r^2-z^2)|.\n$$\n\nFinally, since the electric field `E` is defined as the force per unit charge, we can write the differential force as:\n\n$$\ndF_{\\text{radial}} = E |dq|,\n$$\n\nwhere `E` is the magnitude of the electric field at the location of the charge element `dq`.

Similarly, the current density J is zero because the charge moves uniformly without any acceleration.\n\nIn order to find the electromagnetic field in the laboratory frame, we first solve Maxwell's equations using the transformed four-vector potential A'μ in the primed frame and then transform back to the laboratory frame using the inverse Lorentz transformation. We can start from the equation for the divergence of the electric field:\n\n∇⋅E = ρ/ε₀ → ∇⋅E = qδ³(r - r') / ε₀\n\nUsing Gauss' theorem, we can rewrite this expression as an integral over a closed surface S enclosing the charge q:\n\n∫∫∫S ∇⋅E d³V = q / ε₀\n\nSince the charge q is located on the x-axis, we choose cylindrical coordinates (r, φ, z) centered around the x-axis. Then, the differential volume element becomes dr dz dφ sin(φ), and the unit normal vectors n̂ become (cos(φ), sin(φ), 0). Now, we integrate over all angles φ and z while keeping r fixed:\n\n∫∫[E_r cos(φ) + E_z] r dz dφ = q / ε₀\n\nIntegrating over z gives us:\n\n∫[E_r r cos²(φ) + E_z r] dφ = q / ε₀\n\nWe now make use of symmetry arguments to simplify the integrals. Since the system has rotational symmetry about the x-axis, the components E_r and E_z must be independent of φ. Therefore, we can take the average value of these components over all angles:\n\n(E_r r + E_z r)/2 * 2π = q / ε₀\n\nFinally, solving for E_r and E_z yields:\n\nE_r = -E_z = (q / 2πε₀ r)\n\nHowever, we want to express the electric field components in Cartesian coordinates instead of cylindrical coordinates. Using the chain rule, we can relate the radial component Er to the cartesian components Ex and Ez:\n\nEr = Ex*cos(θ) + Ez*sin(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the positive x-axis and the radius vector r. For simplicity, let us assume that the charge q is located at the origin (r=0), which means that θ equals either 0 or π radians depending on whether we approach the charge from the positive or negative x-direction respectively. Thus, we have:\n\nEx = -Ez = (q / 2πε₀ |x|)\n\nNext, let us consider the curl of the electric field:\n\n∇×E = -∂B/∂t\n\nTaking the curl of the above expression for the electric field, we get:\n\n∇×E = (-q/(2πε₀ |x|))(-∂/∂x)(1/|x|)i - (-q/(2πε₀ |x|))(-∂/∂z)k = (q/(4πε₀ |x|^3))(-x i + z k)\n\nThe time derivative term vanishes due to the assumption that the charge is moving with constant velocity. Comparing this result with the general form of the magnetic field induced by a moving charge (Ampere's Law):\n\nB = (μ₀/4π) * (q/(4π|r|^3))((v × r)/|r|^2)\n\nwe see that the magnetic field components Bx, By, and Bz should satisfy the following relations:\n\nBx = 0,      By = (q/(4πε₀ c²))*(γvz - βγvy),       Bz = -(q/(4πε₀ c²))*(γvy + βγvz)\n\nTo obtain the final expressions for the electromagnetic field components, we note that the speed of light c appears in both the electric and magnetic field expressions through the factors γ and β. Furthermore, we have chosen units such that K = 1, so we can eliminate the constants μ₀ and ε₀ by setting them equal to 1. Finally, we combine terms to arrive at the desired results:\n\n\\[\nE_x = \\frac{q}{\\chi} \\gamma (x - vt), \\quad B_x = 0, \\\\\nE_y = \\frac{q}{\\chi} \\gamma y, \\quad B_y = -\\frac{q}{\\chi} \\beta \\gamma z, \\\\\nE_z = \\frac{q}{\\chi} \\gamma z, \\quad B_z = \\frac{q}{\\chi} \\beta \\gamma y,\n\\]\n\nwith\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{v}{c}, \\quad \\gamma = \\left(1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}},\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\chi = \\{\\gamma^2 (x - vt)^2 + y^2 + z^2\\}^{3/2}.", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

Rest Frame:\n   - Since both particles are at rest in this frame, their velocities are zero, i.e., $\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{0}$.\n   - As there are no external electric or magnetic fields present, we have $\\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{0}$ and $\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n   - However, due to the presence of charge, each particle creates an electrostatic field around itself. But since they are stationary, the electric field created by one particle does not affect the other. So, the Lorentz force on either particle is zero, i.e., $\\mathbf{F}_1 = q\\mathbf{E} + q(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}) = \\mathbf{0}$ and $\\mathbf{F}_2 = \\mathbf{0}$.\n   - Acceleration is also zero because velocity is constant, i.e., $\\mathbf{a}_1 = d\\mathbf{v}/dt = \\mathbf{0}$ and $\\mathbf{a}_2 = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\n2. Laboratory Frame:\n   - Let's assume that the relative speed between the two positrons in the lab frame is $\\beta c$ ($c$: speed of light). Then, the velocities can be written as $\\mathbf{v}_{1,lab} = -\\frac{\\beta}{2}c\\hat{i}$ for $e^+_1$ moving left and $\\mathbf{v}_{2,lab} = +\\frac{\\beta}{2}c\\hat{i}$ for $e^+_2$ moving right. Here, $\\hat{i}$ is the unit vector along the x-axis.\n   - The electric field experienced by each positron depends on its own charge density and the charge distribution of the other positron. Due to symmetry, the electric field points radially outward from each positron towards the empty space. However, since the charges are moving away from each other, they create an equal but opposite electric field that cancel each other out. Therefore, $\\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n   - Now, let's consider the magnetic field. Each positron moves with a velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{1,lab}$ or $\\mathbf{v}_{2,lab}$ respectively, creating a current loop with the other positron. According to Ampere's law, the magnetic field produced by such a current loop follows Biot-Savart Law. For simplicity, let's approximate the positrons as point charges moving in circular paths centered at the midpoint between them. This gives us a ring current model. The magnetic field lines form closed loops surrounding the line connecting the two positrons. The magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the ring (where our positrons are located) can be calculated using the Biot-Savart Law and the approximation of the positrons as point charges. After some calculations, you get $\\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0\\frac{q}{4\\pi}\\frac{\\beta}{\\left(1-\\beta^2/4\\right)^{3/2}}\\hat{k}$, where $\\hat{k}$ is the unit vector along the z-axis.\n   - The Lorentz force acting on each positron is given by $\\mathbf{F} = q(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B})$. Using the above expression for $\\mathbf{B}$, we find that the forces are directed along the y-axis and have the same magnitude $F = m_ec^2\\frac{\\beta^2}{(1-\\beta^2/4)^2}$.\n   - Finally, the acceleration can be found by taking the derivative of the velocity with respect to time, which yields $\\mathbf{a} = d\\mathbf{v}/dt = \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{ds}\\frac{ds}{dt} = \\frac{\\beta^2c}{(1-\\beta^2/4)}\\hat{j}$.\n\n(b) When the positrons move side by side, the situation becomes more complex because now they interact through both electric and magnetic fields. The calculation would involve solving Maxwell's equations for this system, which is beyond the scope of this question. However, intuitively speaking, when the positrons are close together, their Coulomb repulsion causes them to experience an electric force pushing them apart. Simultaneously, their motion generates a magnetic field that tries to keep them together due to the Lorentz force. Depending on the exact separation distance and relative speeds, it may result in stable coexistence or eventual separation of the positrons.", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

This implies that A has no spatial dependence in y or z directions. Therefore, the component of the vector potential in the x-direction must be zero because it's only dependent on x, i.e., \\(A_x = \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial x} = 0\\).\n\n(b) To find the perpendicular momentum of the charged particle, we can use Lorentz force law in differential form. Recall that the electric field E can be derived from the vector potential as \\(E = -\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial t}\\), while the magnetic field B is related to the curl of the vector potential (\\(\\nabla \\times A = B\\)). For a plane wave traveling in the positive x-direction, these fields simplify to:\n\n\\[E = -\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial t}, \\quad B = \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial y}.\\]\n\nNow let us consider a small displacement dx dy dt of the particle during which its velocity changes from v to v + dv. Using the Lorentz force law, we have:\n\n\\[m\\frac{dv}{dt} = e(-\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial t}) + e(\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial y})\\cdot v.\\]\n\nSince the particle moves only in the yz-plane, we can write the velocity as (v, 0, w), where w is the velocity in the z-direction. Now, let's assume that the change in velocity occurs solely in the y-direction, i.e., dw = 0. Then, we can rewrite the above equation as:\n\n\\[m\\frac{dv}{dt} = e\\left[-\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial t}+v\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial y}\\right],\\]\n\nwhere we used the chain rule to differentiate A with respect to t when it appears inside the square brackets.

So, the state of polarization of the reflected wave remains linearly polarized at 45 degrees to the x and y axes.\n\n(b) To find the relative amplitudes and phases of the transmitted electric fields for polarization in the x and y directions, let's assume the incident electric field vector has magnitudes E_0x and E_0y for the x and y components respectively:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{E}_{incident} = E_0x \\hat{i} + E_0y \\frac{\\hat{i}+\\hat{j}}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\n\nUpon entering the slab, the electric field vectors split into two orthogonal components parallel to the x and y axes within the slab. Let T_x and T_y denote the transmission coefficients for each component. We can write the transmitted electric field vectors as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{E}_{transmit,x} = T_x E_0x \\hat{i} \\\\\n\\vec{E}_{transmit,y} = T_y E_0y \\frac{\\hat{i}+\\hat{j}}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\n\nThe transmission coefficient for each component depends on the refractive index of the corresponding axis and the angle of incidence (which is zero here):\n\n\\[\nT_x = \\frac{1}{n_x} \\left(\\frac{n_x - 1}{n_x + 1}\\right)^2 \\\\\nT_y = \\frac{1}{n_y} \\left(\\frac{n_y - 1}{n_y + 1}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nNow, let d represent the thickness of the slab. After passing through the slab, the transmitted waves experience a phase shift proportional to their wavelength times the number of half cycles traversed inside the slab. This gives us a total phase difference of k_x * d for the x-polarized wave and k_y * d for the y-polarized wave, where k_x and k_y are the wave numbers associated with the x and y axes respectively.\n\nSince the speed of light in the medium is given by c/n, we have:\n\n\\[\nk_x = \\omega / v_x = \\omega n_x / c \\\\\nk_y = \\omega / v_y = \\omega n_y / c\n\\]\n\nFinally, the transmitted electric field vector can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\vec{E}_{transmit} = \\vec{E}_{transmit,x} e^{ik_xd} + \\vec{E}_{transmit,y} e^{ik_yd}\n\\]\n\nTo express the above equation in terms of the initial electric field components, substitute the expressions for T_x, T_y, k_x, and k_y:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\vec{E}_{transmit} &= \\left[ \\frac{1}{n_x} \\left(\\frac{n_x - 1}{n_x + 1}\\right)^2 E_0x \\right] \\hat{i} e^{ik_xd} + \\left[ \\frac{1}{n_y} \\left(\\frac{n_y - 1}{n_y + 1}\\right)^2 E_0y \\frac{\\hat{i}+\\hat{j}}{\\sqrt{2}} e^{ik_yd} \\right] \\\\\n&= \\left[ \\frac{(n_x - 1)^2}{(n_x+1)^2} E_0x \\right] \\hat{i} e^{\\frac{i \\omega n_x d}{c}} + \\left[ \\frac{(n_y - 1)^2}{(n_y+1)^2} \\frac{E_0y}{\\sqrt{2}} (\\hat{i}+e^{i\\Delta k d} \\hat{j}) \\right],\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nwhere $\\Delta k = k_y - k_x$.\n\nThis expression represents the transmitted electric field vector after passing through the slab.

However, in our case, we have an anisotropic medium, so ε becomes a tensor. The generalization of these relations still holds if we can prove that **H**, **D**, and **K** remain mutually orthogonal.\n\nSince the medium is non-conducting, there exists no free charge density, i.e., ρ = 0.

Next, we need to find the rate of change of the magnetic flux ($\\frac{d\\Phi}{dt}$) as the magnet is turned on. Since the magnetic field is constant, the only variable here is the area of the loop ($A$). As no current is initially flowing, the loop remains stationary, so the area does not change instantaneously when the magnet is turned on. However, as current starts to flow, the loop expands slightly due to the Lorentz force acting on the charges within the loop. This expansion increases the area and thus the magnetic flux over time. We can approximate the rate of change of the magnetic flux as a linear function of time:\n   \\[ \\frac{d\\Phi}{dt} = kt, \\]\n   for some positive constant $k$.\n\n3. Now, we have an induced emf, which tends to oppose the change causing it (Lenz's law). In our case, the change is the increasing magnetic flux, so the induced emf opposes the increase in flux. Therefore, the direction of the current induced in the loop is counterclockwise if viewed from above (opposing the increase in flux).\n\n4. Using Faraday's law, the induced emf equals the product of the total resistance and the rate of change of the charge enclosed by the loop:\n   \\[ \\mathcal{E} = R\\frac{dq}{dt}. \\]\n\n5.

Angular Momentum Conservation: The angular momentum of the electron remains conserved since there are no external torques acting on the system. Initially, the angular momentum is given by $L_0= mvr_0$. As the radius decreases, the speed increases because the kinetic energy must be preserved ($K=\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$).

Rearrange this equation to express $r$: $r=\\frac{4L_0}{mv_{max}}$.\n\n2. Power Dissipation: The power emitted by the electron during each revolution is given by $P=\\frac{2}{3}\\frac{(e^4)}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0 c)^3 r^2}$. Integrating this over one period ($T$) yields the total energy lost by the electron: $W=\\int P dt = \\frac{2}{3}\\frac{(e^4)}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0 c)^3}\\int_{\\frac{r_0}{2}}^0 \\frac{dr}{r^2}=\\frac{e^4}{(6\\pi\\epsilon_0 c)^3}[\\frac{1}{\\frac{r_0}{2}}]$.\n\n   Note that the total energy of the hydrogen atom is initially $(13.6 eV)=(\\frac{1}{2})mv_{initial}^2+\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r_0}$.

This means that any induced charge distribution creates a static electric field that exactly cancels out the electric field from the motion of the charged particles.\n\n3. However, since there is no net electric field inside the conductor, the total force on each infinitesimal area should balance out to zero. Therefore, the Lorentz force on one side of the elemental area must equal but oppose the Lorentz force on the other side. Thus, the net force on the entire sphere is zero, which implies that the total charge enclosed by any closed loop on the surface of the sphere remains constant.\n\n4. Now, let us apply Gauss's law for electromagnetism to a cylindrical Gaussian surface with its axis along the direction of motion ($\\mathbf{e}_x$). The flux of the electric field through the curved surfaces of the cylinder vanishes because $\\mathbf{E}=0$, while the flux through the two ends of the cylinder is proportional to the surface charge densities on those ends.\n\n5.

When the charged particle moves through the electric field created by the spherical shell, work is done on or by the particle.\n\n1. First, let's find the electric field outside the conductor (spherical shell). Since the shell is neutral, it creates an electric field such that the net force on any charge inside the shell is zero. The electric field outside the shell points radially outward because positive charges would move away if there were any.\n\n   For a point charge $Q$ located at the center of the shell, the electric field at a distance $r > R$ can be calculated using Coulomb's law:\n\n   \\[E = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\cdot \\frac{|Q|}{r^2}\\]\n\n   Here, $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.\n\n2.

We can then solve for the induced electric field using the divergence theorem and the boundary condition that the normal component of E vanishes on the surface of the sphere.\n\nThe torque experienced by the sphere during the demagnetization process can be found using the formula for the torque on a magnetic dipole in an external magnetic field:\n\n\\[\\vec\\tau = \\vec\\mu \\times \\vec B\\]\n\nAs the sphere becomes less magnetized, its magnetic dipole moment decreases, leading to a decrease in the magnitude of the torque. However, the direction of the torque remains constant because the external magnetic field (due to Earth or any other sources) doesn't change significantly within the time scale of the demagnetization process.\n\nTo calculate the total angular momentum imparted to the sphere, we first need to determine how much the magnetic dipole moment changes during the demagnetization process. Then, we can express the angular momentum L as:\n\n\\[L = I\\omega = I\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = I\\int_{t_i}^{t_f} \\frac{d\\theta}{dt'} dt'\\]\n\nwhere I is the moment of inertia of the sphere, $\\theta$ is the angle between the initial and final directions of the magnetic dipole moment, and $t_i$ and $t_f$ represent the start and end times of the demagnetization process, respectively.\n\n(c) The angular momentum comes from the conservation of angular momentum principle. As the magnetic dipole moment of the sphere decreases, the torque acting on the sphere causes the sphere to rotate about some axis.

{"id": "electro/5_14", "solution": " To find the net radial force on an individual electron, we need to consider both the electric and magnetic forces acting upon it due to its motion through the beam. We'll start by finding these forces separately and then add them up.\n\n1. Electric Force: In a charged particle's rest frame, there is no electric field present because charges cancel out. However, when the particles are moving relative to each other, they create an electric field. The electric field strength can be calculated using Gauss' law for cylindrical symmetry:\n\n\\[E = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi r} = \\frac{en(4\\pi r^2)v}{2\\pi r},\\] where \\(r\\) is the distance from the central electron, \\(e\\) is the charge of an electron, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the linear charge density (which equals \\(en\\)).\n\nThe electric force on the central electron will be directed radially outward since it's positive and acts away from negative charges.\n\n2. Magnetic Force: Due to the motion of the surrounding electrons, there exists a magnetic field around the central electron. Using Ampere's Law for a long straight wire carrying current I, we have:\n\n\\[B = \\mu_0I = \\mu_0 en v,\\] where \\(\\mu_0\\) is the permeability of free space.\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnetic force on the central electron using Lorentz force law:\n\n\\[F_B = qvB_\\perp = -evBsin(\\theta),\\] where \\(q=-e\\), \\(v\\) is the speed of the central electron (assuming it moves along with the beam), \\(B\\) is the magnitude of the magnetic field, and \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between the magnetic field direction and the central electron's velocity vector. Since the beam is infinitely long, we assume that the magnetic field lines are parallel to the beam axis, so \\(\\theta=\\pi/2\\).\n\n3. Combining Forces: Now, we sum up the electric and magnetic forces to get the total radial force on the central electron:\n\n\\[F_{net} = F_E + F_B\\] \\[= eE + evB\\] \\[= e\\left(\\frac{en(4\\pi r^2)v}{2\\pi r}\\right) - ev\\mu_0env\\] \\[= en^2(4\\pi r^2)ve - ev\\mu_0en^2v^2\\]\n\nSince this expression depends on the position (\\(r\\)) of the central electron within the beam, it doesn't represent a net force that would act on all electrons equally. This means that the electrons do not experience a net radial force in an infinitely long cylindrical beam of relativistic electrons. Instead, they undergo continuous acceleration due to their mutual interactions.\n\nIn summary, the net radial force on an individual electron in an infinitely long cylindrical beam of relativistic electrons is zero.\n\n\\[\\boxed{F_{net}=0}\\]", "final_answers": ["F_{net}=0"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "F_{net}=0", "expr2": "\\mathbf{F} = \\frac{e^2 n r}{2 \\pi \\epsilon_0 \\gamma^2} \\mathbf{e}_r"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "0", "expr2": "e**3*mathbf*n*r/(2*epsilon*gamma**2*pi)"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "Electricity and Magenetism/9-3", "solution": " (a) To demonstrate that a quadrupole acts as a lens for relativistic charged particles moving along the z-axis, we need to consider the Lorentz force $\\vec F=q(\\vec v\\times\\vec B)$ acting on the particle with charge q and velocity $\\vec v$. Since the particle moves along the z-axis ($v_z=\\beta c$, $v_x=v_y=0$), the Lorentz force has only an x or y component depending on the direction of motion:\n\nFor x-direction: $F_x=qv_yB$\nFor y-direction: $F_y=-qv_xB$\n\nNow let's find the net deflection after passing through the entire quadrupole. The change in momentum ($\\Delta p$) can be related to the applied force using Newton's second law:\n\n$\\Delta p = \\int_{z_i}^{z_f} F dz = \\pm q \\int_{z_i}^{z_f} B(z) v_\\perp dz$\n\nwhere $z_i$ and $z_f$ are the initial and final positions of the particle within the quadrupole, respectively; $v_\\perp$ represents either $v_x$ or $v_y$; and the sign depends on whether the particle enters from the positive or negative side of the quadrupole.\n\nThe magnetic field inside the quadrupole varies linearly with distance from the axis, so we can write it as $B(z)=B_0(1-\\frac{|z|}{R})$. Integrating the above equation gives us the change in momentum:\n\n$\\Delta p_{\\pm x} = \\mp q B_0 v_y \\int_{-L/2}^{+L/2}(1-\\frac{|z|}{R})dz = \\mp q B_0 v_y (\\pm L - \\frac{L^2}{3R})$\n\nSimilarly, for the y-direction:\n\n$\\Delta p_{\\pm y} = \\pm q B_0 v_x (\\pm L - \\frac{L^2}{3R})$\n\nSince the particle is moving along the z-axis, its velocities in the x and y directions are zero before entering the quadrupole ($v_x=v_y=0$). However, upon exiting the quadrupole, there will be some nonzero values due to the deflections caused by the magnetic field. We can approximate these final velocities as small compared to the original velocity along the z-axis ($c\\beta$), i.e., $|v_x|\\ll |\\beta c|$ and $|v_y|\\ll |\\beta c|$. Using this approximation, we can neglect higher order terms involving products of $v_x$ and $v_y$:\n\n$\\Delta p_{\\pm x} \\approx \\mp q B_0 v_y L$\n$\\Delta p_{\\pm y} \\approx \\pm q B_0 v_x L$\n\nNow we can relate changes in momentum to changes in position via energy conservation:\n\n$\\Delta E = \\gamma mc^2 = \\sqrt{(mc^2)^2+(pc)^2}-\\sqrt{(mc^2)^2+(p_0c)^2}$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $m$ is the rest mass of the particle, $p$ is the total momentum including the deflected components, and $p_0$ is the initial momentum along the z-axis. Expanding the square roots and keeping only first-order terms in $\\Delta p$ give us:\n\n$\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\Delta pc^2}{\\sqrt{(mc^2)^2+(p_0c)^2}} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta p c^2}{\\beta^2 mc^2}$\n\nUsing the relation between kinetic energy and momentum $(KE=\\frac{pc^2}{\\beta^2})$, we get:\n\n$\\Delta KE = \\frac{\\Delta p c^2}{\\beta^2} = \\Delta p_{\\pm x}^2+\\Delta p_{\\pm y}^2$\n\nFinally, we can express the deflection angles in each direction:\n\n$\\theta_x = \\frac{\\Delta p_{\\pm x}}{p_0} = \\pm \\frac{q B_0 L v_y}{\\beta^2 p_0}$\n$\\theta_y = \\frac{\\Delta p_{\\pm y}}{p_0} = \\pm \\frac{q B_0 L v_x}{\\beta^2 p_0}$\n\nFrom these equations, it is clear that the focusing is not the same in both the x and y directions because they depend on different velocities ($v_x$ and $v_y$). In general, the focusing strength can be adjusted by changing the gradient of the magnetic field, which determines the ratio of $v_x$ to $v_y$ deflections.\n\n(b) For a \"realistic\" warm-iron quadrupole with $L=2m$, $B=1T$, $R=20cm$, and $E=20GeV$, we first calculate the initial momentum of the electron:\n\n$p_0 = \\frac{\\beta mc}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}} = \\frac{20*1.6726*10^{-27} kg * (3*10^8 m/s)}{\\sqrt{1-(20/(3*10^8))^2}} \\approx 4.59*10^{-14} kg m/s$\n\nThen, we use the expressions derived earlier to compute the deflection angles:\n\n$\\theta_x = \\pm \\frac{q B_0 L v_y}{\\beta^2 p_0} = \\pm \\frac{(1.602*10^{-19} C)(1 T)(2m)}{(20/(3*10^8))^2 (4.59*10^{-14} kg m/s)} \\approx \\pm 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "Electricity and Magenetism/11-3", "solution": " (a) We'll solve this problem using Lenz's law for the electromagnetic wave emitted due to acceleration of the charged particle. The Poynting vector S gives us the directional energy flux density, which can be used to find the power per unit area (intensity). In our case, we have only radial components of electric E and magnetic B fields.\n\nThe expression for the Poynting vector is given by:\n\nS = E * B / μ₀\n\nwhere E is the electric field strength, B is the magnetic field strength, and μ₀ is the vacuum permittivity.\n\nFirst, let's derive expressions for E and B. For simplicity, we consider that the motion of the charged particle is purely vertical. The electric field E at a distance R from the particle is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\nE = q/(4πε₀R^2)\n\nSince the particle is moving up and down, its velocity v(t) varies sinusoidally with time t. The maximum velocity occurs when the particle passes through the equilibrium position (at t=π/2):\n\nv\\_max = sqrt((8gh)/π)\n\nNow, since d<<h, we can approximate the displacement x(t) as linear:\n\nx(t) = -d*sin(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere ω = sqrt(k/m) is the angular frequency of the oscillations.\n\nUsing Newton's second law, we get the acceleration a(t):\n\na(t) = -ω²*x(t)\n\nCombining these equations, we obtain the instantaneous velocity and acceleration:\n\nv(t) = v\\_max*cos(ωt + φ)\na(t) = -ω²*x(t) = ω²*d*sin(ωt + φ)\n\nNext, we need to determine the magnetic field B produced by the changing electric field E. Using Faraday's induction law, we have:\n\nB = -μ₀*ω*E\n\nFinally, substituting the expressions for E and a into the equation for S, we get the intensity I(R) at a distance R:\n\nI(R) = (q^2*ω^6*d^2*cos²(ωt+φ))/(16π³ε₀²R^2)\n\nTo find the location where the radiation is most intense, we set the derivative of I(R) equal to zero and solve for R:\n\n∂I(R)/∂R = (-3*(q^2*ω^6*d^2*cos²(ωt+φ)))/(16π³ε₀²R^3) = 0\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nR\\_max = (3*q^2*ω^6*d^2*cos²(ωt+φ))/(16π³ε₀²I\\_(max))\n\nWhere I\\_(max)\\_ is the maximum value of the intensity. However, without knowing the exact initial conditions or the specific values of q, m, k, g, h, and d, we cannot evaluate I\\_(max)\\_ explicitly.\n\n(b) To check our result, assuming the floor is of infinite extent means that all the radiation strikes the floor. So, integrating the intensity over the whole surface of the floor should give us the total power dissipated, which equals the average energy per unit time striking the entire floor. This total power is simply the integral of I(R) over all distances R:\n\nP\\_total = ∫I(R)*2πR*dR\n\nSubstitute the expression for I(R) and perform the integration:\n\nP\\_total = (q^2*ω^6*d^2)/(16π²ε₀²)\n\nComparing this result with the expected energy loss per cycle (which is twice the potential energy stored initially), we see that they match if the fraction of the total energy lost in one cycle is indeed very small, as assumed earlier.\n\n(c) Since the amplitude decreases exponentially with time due to energy loss, we can use the following exponential decay relationship:\n\nx(t) = x\\_0*exp(-γt)\n\nwhere x\\_0 is the initial amplitude, γ is the decay rate, and t is the elapsed time. From part (a), we know that the initial amplitude is d. Assuming the fraction of the total energy lost in one cycle remains small, the decay rate γ can be approximated as proportional to the intensity at the equilibrium position (i.e., R=h):\n\nγ ≈ A*I(h)\n\nPlugging in the expression for I(R) and solving for t yields:\n\nt = ln(d/x) / (Ah)\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific values of A and h, we cannot evaluate t exactly.", "final_answers": [], "equivalency_results": [], "accuracy": 0.0}

Since $E_x$ cannot depend on $y$ due to the first equation, it follows that $E_x = 0$. Similarly, since $H_x$ cannot depend on $x$ or $y$, it also vanishes. Thus, the electric field lies entirely within the $yz$-plane, while the magnetic field has only an $x$-component.\n\nNow let us consider the remaining equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n-\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial y} &= -\\omega H_x = 0,\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial H_z}{\\partial x} &= \\omega E_y.\n\\end{align*}\\\\\nIntegrating the second equation with respect to $x$, we get:\n\n\\[H_z(x,y) = \\omega\\int_{0}^{x} E_y(\\xi,y)\\,d\\xi.\\]\\\\\nDifferentiating this expression with respect to $y$, using the fact that $E_y$ does not depend on $x$:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial H_z}{\\partial y} = \\omega\\int_{0}^{x} \\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial y}\\,d\\xi = \\omega E_y(x,y).\\]\\\\\nComparing this result with the second original equation, we find that:\n\n\\[-\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial y} = \\omega E_y,\\]\nwhich implies that:\n\n\\[E_y(x,y) = C\\sin(\\omega y),\\]\nwhere $C$ is some constant.

The moving charge in the conductor experiences this magnetic field and gets accelerated perpendicularly to both its motion and the magnetic field direction.

{"id": "Electricity and Magenetism/9-1", "solution": " To calculate the force of magnetic attraction between two point charges moving with constant velocities, we can use Lenz's law which states that the direction of the induced current (and thus the magnetic field) is such that it opposes the motion creating the magnetic field. However, since our object is a spinning spherical shell, we need to consider its distribution of charge and apply Ampere's Law instead.\n\nFirst, let's find the current generated due to the rotation of the charged sphere. The linear charge density of the ring element dq on the sphere is given by $\\lambda = \\sigma R^2\\sin(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle from the symmetry axis. The infinitesimal current element dI produced by this ring is then:\n\n\\[dI=\\frac{dq}{dt}=\\lambda\\omega\\cos(\\theta)\\]\n\nNow, we integrate over all rings on the sphere to get the total current I flowing through the sphere:\n\n\\[I=2\\pi\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\lambda\\omega\\cos(\\theta) sin(\\theta) d\\theta\\]\n\nSubstituting for $\\lambda$ gives us:\n\n\\[I=2\\pi\\sigma\\omega\\int_{0}^{\\pi} R^2\\sin^3(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) d\\theta\\]\n\nThe integral evaluates to:\n\n\\[I=\\frac{8\\pi\\sigma\\omega R^2}{15}\\]\n\nNext, we will use Ampere's Law to find the magnetic field B created by this current.

{"id": "Electricity and Magenetism/6-2", "solution": " The given problem involves understanding why current doesn't concentrate along the axis of a wire due to the repulsion between parallel currents, known as the \"pinch effect.\" To address this issue, we will consider a model where positive charges are stationary while negatively charged electrons move with velocity `v`. We will then derive an expression for the electron density `ρ_-` in terms of the positive charge density `ρ_+`, using relativistic effects.\n\nFirst, let us recall some basic concepts:\n\n* The electric field `E` produced by a moving point charge `q` is given by `E = q/(4πε₀r) * γ`, where `r` is the distance from the charge, `c` is the speed of light, and `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2)/c^2)` is the Lorentz factor.\n* Since the net charge inside a neutral conductor must be zero, we have `ρ_+ + ρ_- = 0`.\n\nNow, let us assume that the wire has a cross sectional area `A` and length `L`. The total number of positively charged particles per unit volume is `ρ_+ / e`, where `e` is the elementary charge. Similarly, the total number of negatively charged electrons per unit volume is `ρ_- / e`. As the wire is neutral, there are equal numbers of positive and negative charges, i.e., `ρ_+ / e = ρ_- / e`. Rearrange this equation to find `ρ_-` in terms of `ρ_+`.\n\nSince the electrons are moving with velocity `v`, they experience a force due to their own electric field. This force causes them to accelerate towards each other, counteracting the outward force caused by the repulsion between parallel currents. To calculate the electric field experienced by the electrons, we need to determine the charge distribution around them.\n\nConsider a small cylindrical region of radius `r` and length `dr` centered on an electron. The charge enclosed in this region is approximately `-e * dρ_-(r) * dr`, where `dρ_(r)` is the differential change in electron density with respect to radial position `r`. The electric field `Ed(r)` at the location of the electron due to this charge distribution is given by:\n\n\\[ Ed(r) = -\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\cdot \\frac{-e \\cdot d\\rho_-(r)}{r} \\cdot \\gamma \\]\n\nThe force acting on the electron due to its own electric field is `F = q * E = (-e) * Ed(r)`. Integrating this force over the entire path of the electron gives the net force exerted on it:\n\n\\[ F_{net} = \\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} F(z) dz = \\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \\left[-\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r} \\cdot \\gamma \\right] dz \\]\n\nwhere `z` represents the axial coordinate. Note that the integrand does not depend on `z`, so we can simplify the integral to:\n\n\\[ F_{net} = -\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \\frac{dz}{r} \\]\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we make use of the fact that the electrons are evenly distributed throughout the wire, meaning that the average distance between electrons is roughly half the diameter of the wire. Let `D` denote the diameter of the wire; thus, the average separation between electrons is `D/2`. Now, we can approximate the integral as follows:\n\n\\[ F_{net} \\approx -\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\frac{2}{\\text{average separation}} = -\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\frac{8}{D} \\]\n\nThis net force acts radially inwards, causing the electrons to accumulate closer together and reducing the current concentration along the axis.\n\nWe now have an expression for the net force acting on the electrons, but our goal was to express the electron density `ρ_-` in terms of the positive charge density `ρ_+`. To achieve this, we first rewrite the net force in terms of the electron density:\n\n\\[ F_{net} = -\\frac{e^3}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 D} \\cdot \\gamma \\]\n\nNext, we equate this net force to the product of the electron charge `e`, its linear acceleration `a`, and its mass `m`:\n\n\\[ m \\cdot a = -\\frac{e^3}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 D} \\cdot \\gamma \\]\n\nRecall that the linear acceleration of a particle under constant force `F` is given by `a = F / m`. Substituting this expression into the above equation yields:\n\n\\[ a = -\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 D} \\cdot \\gamma \\]\n\nNow, we relate the linear acceleration `a` to the electron velocity `v` through Newton's second law:\n\n\\[ ma = m \\cdot \\frac{dv}{dt} = -\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 D} \\cdot \\gamma \\]\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to time `t` gives:\n\n\\[ \\int dv = -\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 m D} \\cdot \\int dt \\cdot \\gamma \\]\n\nAssuming the initial velocity of the electrons is zero, we can solve for the final velocity `v`:\n\n\\[ v = -\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 m D} \\cdot \\int dt \\cdot \\gamma \\]\n\nAt this point, we cannot integrate directly because we don't know how the Lorentz factor `γ` varies with time. However, we can make an approximation assuming that the electrons reach a steady state where their velocity remains relatively constant. Under this assumption, we set the derivative of `γ` with respect to time equal to zero:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d\\gamma}{dt} = \\frac{(v/c)\\cdot (dv/dt)}{(1-(v/c)^2)^{3/2}} = 0 \\]\n\nSolving for `dv/dt` gives:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{c^2}{(v/c)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1-(v/c)^2)^{3/2}} \\]\n\nSubstitute this expression back into the equation for `v`:\n\n\\[ v = -\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 m D} \\cdot \\int dt \\cdot \\frac{c^2}{(v/c)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1-(v/c)^2)^{3/2}} \\]\n\nAgain, we cannot integrate this equation analytically without knowing the initial conditions. Nevertheless, we can make another approximation by setting the right-hand side equal to a constant `K`:\n\n\\[ K = -\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 m D} \\cdot \\frac{c^2}{(v/c)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1-(v/c)^2)^{3/2}} \\]\n\nRearrange this equation to isolate `v`:\n\n\\[ v = -\\frac{K \\cdot (1-(v/c)^2)^{3/2}}{e^2/(4\\pi\\epsilon_0 m D) \\cdot c^2} \\]\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for `v` into the relation between the positive and negative charge densities:\n\n\\[ \\rho_- = -\\frac{\\rho_+}{e} = -\\frac{\\rho_+}{e} \\cdot \\frac{e^2}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0 m D) \\cdot K \\cdot (1-(v/c)^2)^{3/2}} \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n\n\\[ \\rho_- = -\\frac{\\rho_+}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0 m D) \\cdot K} \\cdot (1-(v/c)^2)^{3/2} \\]\n\nFinally, we recognize that $(1-(v/c)^2)$ is equivalent to $\\gamma^{-2}$, allowing us to write:\n\n\\[ \\rho_- = -\\frac{\\rho_+}{(4\\pi\\epsilon_0 m D) \\cdot K} \\cdot (\\gamma^2)^{-3/2} \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by $(\\gamma^2)^{3/2}$ results in:\n\n\\[ \\rho_- = -\\frac{\\rho_+}{(\\gamma^2)^{3/2} \\cdot (4\\pi\\epsilon_0 m D) \\cdot K} \\]\n\nComparing this result with the desired form $\\rho_- = -C^2 \\rho_+$, we see that $C^2 = (\\gamma^2)^{-3/2}$. Recalling that $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}$, we obtain:\n\n\\[ C^2 = \\frac{1}{1-(v/c)^2} = \\frac{1}{1-(v^2/c^2)} = \\frac{1}{1-(\\beta^2)} \\]\n\nwhere $\\beta = v/c$ is the normalized velocity of the electrons. Thus, we have derived the relationship between the positive and negative charge densities:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\rho_- = -\\frac{\\rho_+}{(\\gamma^2)^{3/2}}} \\]\n\nAs for the question about the location of the compensating charge, if the wire is neutral overall, any excess positive or negative charge would exist on the surface of the wire. These charges create an electrostatic potential difference across the wire, which opposes further redistribution of charge. Therefore, the compensating charge necessary to maintain neutrality resides primarily on the surface of the wire rather than being distributed throughout the bulk material.", "final_answers": ["\\rho_- = -\\frac{\\rho_+}{(\\gamma^2)^{3/2}}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\rho_- = -\\frac{\\rho_+}{(\\gamma^2)^{3/2}}", "expr2": "\\rho_{-} = -\\gamma^2 \\rho_{+}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": "I expected something else here\n-\\frac{\\rho_+}{(\\gamma^2)^{3/2}}\n~~~~~~~~~~~~^"}], "accuracy": 0.0}
