We will solve part (a) using the lens equation and the linear magnification, and then part (b) by estimating the diffraction limit.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Find the magnification\n\nThe lateral (linear) magnification is given by\n\n  m = hᵢ / hₒ = 30 mm / 1750 mm ≈ 0.01714.\n\nSince for a thin lens the magnification is also\n\n  m = dᵢ/dₒ  ⇒  dᵢ = m · dₒ,\n\nwhere dₒ is the object distance from the lens and dᵢ is the image distance, we can express the lens equation in terms of dₒ.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Use the Lens Equation\n\nThe thin lens formula is\n\n  1/f = 1/dₒ + 1/dᵢ.\n\nSubstituting dᵢ = m · dₒ, we have\n\n  1/f = 1/dₒ + 1/(m dₒ) = (1 + m)/(m dₒ).\n\nSolving for dₒ:\n\n  dₒ = (1 + m)/(m) · f.\n\nNow substitute f = 50 mm and m ≈ 0.01714:\n\n  dₒ = (1 + 0.01714)/0.01714 · 50 mm\n     = 1.01714/0.01714 · 50 mm\n     ≈ 59.32 · 50 mm\n     ≈ 2966 mm.\n\nThus, the object (the person) is approximately 2966 mm or about 3 m from the lens.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Diffraction Limit on the Film\n\nThe best resolution obtainable is limited by diffraction. The angular resolution of a circular aperture is given by\n\n  θ = 1.22 λ/D,\n  \nwhere λ is the wavelength and D is the aperture diameter.

(Here d is the distance between adjacent slits.) For very narrow slits the only angular variation comes from the interference between the fields emerging from the slits. (Any single‐slit diffraction envelope is so broad that it can be taken as essentially flat over the region of interest.) The interference pattern is given (apart from an overall constant) by\n\n  I(θ) ∝ [sin(5φ/2)⁄ sin(φ/2)]²    (1)\n\nwhere\n  φ = (2πd/λ) sinθ.\n\nSince we are given d/λ = 10, we may write\n\n  φ = 20π sinθ    (2)\n\nIt is convenient to define a new variable\n\n  x = φ/2 = (πd/λ) sinθ = 10π sinθ.\n\nIn these terms the intensity is\n\n  I(x) ∝ [sin(5x)/ sin x]².    (3)\n\nThe pattern I(x) as a function of x has “principal” (perfect) maxima when the numerator is maximized in the sense that the “missing‐value” indeterminacy is removed by taking a limit.

(In a 5–slit pattern only the ones corresponding to m a multiple of 5 have the full strength 25; the others are “incomplete” and are much lower.) One finds (by a standard analysis) that the strongest of these subsidiary peaks has an intensity of only about 1/16 that of the full maximum. (A short calculation shows that for the first subsidiary peak one obtains in fact I_sub/I_max ≃ 1.56/25 ≃ 0.0625.) Thus the ratio in intensity of the least‐intense peak (of those that are visible, i.e. the subsidiary ones) to the most–intense peak is approximately 1/16.\n\nNext, one asks for “the angular distance of the first intense peak away from θ = 0.” In the interference pattern the very high (or “perfect”) peaks occur whenever the waves from the different slits add completely in phase. Aside from the central one (at θ = 0) the next such maximum occurs when the path–difference between adjacent slits is one wavelength, i.e.\n  d sinθ = λ .\nThus the first “intense” (principal) maximum occurs at\n  sinθ = λ/d = 1/10,\nso that for small angles (in radians)\n  θ ≃ 0.1 rad.\n\nTo summarize our answers:\n\n1. The lowest (subsidiary) peak is only about 1/16 as intense as the main (principal) peak.\n2. The first “intense” peak (the first principal maximum after the center) is at roughly θ = 0.1 rad.\n\nA sketch of I(θ) for 0 ≤ θ ≲ 0.2 would show a very high central maximum at θ = 0.

{"id": "optics/1-41", "solution": "We wish to concentrate the energy that is radiated by a “Lambert‐law” disk (one cm² in area) with brightness\n\n  L = 1 watt · cm⁻² · steradian⁻¹\n\ninto a much smaller image (area = ¼ cm²). We shall work through the parts step‐by‐part.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (a): Total Energy Radiated from the Disk Face\n\nA Lambertian (or “Lambert’s law”) radiator emits with brightness L constant in direction. (Here L is the radiance in units W/(cm²·sr).) The total power radiated from one side is obtained by integrating over the hemisphere (with a cosine factor that comes from the projected area). In general the exitance (or radiant flux per unit area) is\n\n  M = ∫₍hemisphere₎ L cosθ dΩ.\n\nA short calculation shows that\n\n  ∫₍hemisphere₎ cosθ dΩ = π.\n\nThus if the area of the face is A then the total power is\n\n  Pₜₒₜ = L · A · π.\n\nSince A = 1 cm² and L = 1 W · cm⁻² · sr⁻¹, we have\n\n  Pₜₒₜ = π W ≈ 3.14 W.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (b): Imaging with a Lens to Demagnify by a Factor of 1/2\n\nWe are given a quartz lens (with refractive index n = 1.5) that has a diameter of 10 cm and a focal length f = 100 cm. (Note: In many problems the refractive index is relevant to the maximum concentration factor, but here for the imaging geometry we use the familiar thin‐lens formula.) Since we want to “image” the 1 cm² source onto an image of area ¼ cm² the linear magnification must be\n\n  m = √(¼) = ½.\n\nIn a thin–lens system the magnification is given by\n\n  m = v/u      (1)\n\nwith u the object–lens distance and v the lens–image distance, and the lens formula is\n\n  1/f = 1/u + 1/v   (2).\n\nSetting m = v/u = 1/2 means\n\n  v = u/2.\n \nPlugging into (2):\n\n  1/f = 1/u + 2/u = 3/u   →  u = 3f = 300 cm   and  v = 150 cm.\n\nThus one acceptable solution is to place the radiator 300 cm from the lens and have the image form 150 cm on the other side. (There are other imaging systems that work – any system that provides an overall demagnification by 1/2 – but this is a natural choice given the focal length.)\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (c): Estimating the Energy Flux Reaching the ¼ cm² Disk\n\nNotice that although the source radiates a total power of π watts, the lens (of finite size) collects only a small fraction of that power. indeed, the lens “sees” the source only under a limited solid angle. (No optical system can “concentrate” energy to a brightness higher than that of the source; see part (d) below.)\n\nThe lens has a diameter of 10 cm so its area is\n\n  A_lens = π (5 cm)² = 25π cm².\n\nAt the source—located u = 300 cm from the lens—the lens subtends a solid angle\n\n  Ω = (A_lens)/(u²) = (25π cm²)/(300² cm²) = (25π)/(90 000) = π/3600 sr.\n\nBecause the source radiates with brightness L = 1 W/(cm²·sr), the flux collected by the lens is\n\n  Φ_collected = L · (source area) · Ω\n         = 1 (W/(cm²·sr)) · (1 cm²) · (π/3600 sr)\n         = π/3600 W ≈ 0.00087 W.\n\nSince the optical system (if perfect, with no losses) images all of the light collected by the lens onto the ¼ cm² image, the energy flux reaching that disk is approximately π/3600 W (i.e. about 0.00087 W).\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (d): What Sets the Maximum Energy Flux?\n\nNo passive optical system can “cheat” the conservation of brightness (the “brightness theorem”) or – equivalently – the conservation of étendue. Radiance (or brightness) is a conserved quantity in loss‐free imaging. This implies that one cannot concentrate light from an extended source to a spot that is “brighter” (in terms of radiance or flux per unit area per unit solid angle) than the source itself.\n\nEven if one were to change the refractive index n and design a different (perhaps larger or “faster”) optical system, the maximum irradiance (flux per unit area) in the image is limited to\n\n  E_max = π L      (since for a Lambertian surface the exitance is πL).\n\nMoreover, one sometimes shows that the maximum concentration that can be achieved with a refractive system is enhanced by a factor n². In other words, even with an “ideal” concentrator one cannot deliver more flux than that dictated by the product of the source’s brightness (times any enhancement from refraction) and the étendue conservation. Thus, to determine the maximum energy flux into the ¼ cm² disk one must invoke the optical invariant (étendue) and brightness conservation; the “ideal” system would deliver (without losses) the maximum irradiance allowed by a source radiance L, i.e. πL (or n²πL for a refractive concentrator), over the image area.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The total power radiated from the 1 cm² face is\n  Pₜₒₜ = L · A · π = π watts.\n\n(b) To image the 1 cm² source onto a ¼ cm² disk (a demagnification by a factor ½) one may use a thin lens with the source placed at u = 300 cm, so that by the thin–lens formula with f = 100 cm the image is formed at v = 150 cm.\n\n(c) The lens (10 cm diameter) subtends a solid angle π/3600 sr at the source so that the collected power is approximately\n  Φ ≈ (π/3600) watts ≈ 0.00087 W,\nwhich is the estimated energy flux reaching the ¼ cm² disk.\n\n(d) Because radiance is invariant in a passive optical system, no arrangement can yield an image brighter than that of the source. The maximum flux that can be delivered to the image is determined by the conservation of optical étendue (brightness conservation), together with the maximum angular spread (up to a hemisphere, modified by a factor of n² for a refractive system). That is, even with an “ideal” lens system the image irradiance cannot exceed πL (or n²πL) and the optimum concentration is obtained when the outgoing light fills the available ray‐space. This is the reasoning behind the maximum achievable energy flux.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal boxed answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &P_{\\rm tot} = \\pi\\ \\mathrm{W}, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{A 1‐cm}^2\\text{ source imaged with magnification } m=1/2 \\text{ can be obtained by placing the source at } u = 300\\ \\mathrm{cm} \\text{ and the image at } v = 150\\ \\mathrm{cm}\\text{ (with } f = 100\\text{ cm)}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\Phi \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{3600}\\ \\mathrm{W} \\approx 0.00087\\ \\mathrm{W},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &\\text{Because brightness (radiance) is conserved (étendue conservation), no matter how one varies } n \\text{ or the optics one cannot exceed an image irradiance of } \\pi L \\text{ (or } n^2\\pi L\\text{) on the image.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &P_{\\rm tot} = \\pi\\ \\mathrm{W}, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{A 1‐cm}^2\\text{ source imaged with magnification } m=1/2 \\text{ can be obtained by placing the source at } u = 300\\ \\mathrm{cm} \\text{ and the image at } v = 150\\ \\mathrm{cm}\\text{ (with } f = 100\\text{ cm)}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\Phi \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{3600}\\ \\mathrm{W} \\approx 0.00087\\ \\mathrm{W},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &\\text{Because brightness (radiance) is conserved (étendue conservation), no matter how one varies } n \\text{ or the optics one cannot exceed an image irradiance of } \\pi L \\text{ (or } n^2\\pi L\\text{) on the image.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &P_{\\rm tot} = \\pi\\ \\mathrm{W}, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{A 1‐cm}^2\\text{ source imaged with magnification } m=1/2 \\text{ can be obtained by placing the source at } u = 300\\ \\mathrm{cm} \\text{ and the image at } v = 150\\ \\mathrm{cm}\\text{ (with } f = 100\\text{ cm)}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\Phi \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{3600}\\ \\mathrm{W} \\approx 0.00087\\ \\mathrm{W},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &\\text{Because brightness (radiance) is conserved (étendue conservation), no matter how one varies } n \\text{ or the optics one cannot exceed an image irradiance of } \\pi L \\text{ (or } n^2\\pi L\\text{) on the image.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\Phi = 3.14 \\, \\text{W}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &P_{\\rm tot} = \\pi\\ \\mathrm{W}, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{A 1‐cm}^2\\text{ source imaged with magnification } m=1/2 \\text{ can be obtained by placing the source at } u = 300\\ \\mathrm{cm} \\text{ and the image at } v = 150\\ \\mathrm{cm}\\text{ (with } f = 100\\text{ cm)}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\Phi \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{3600}\\ \\mathrm{W} \\approx 0.00087\\ \\mathrm{W},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &\\text{Because brightness (radiance) is conserved (étendue conservation), no matter how one varies } n \\text{ or the optics one cannot exceed an image irradiance of } \\pi L \\text{ (or } n^2\\pi L\\text{) on the image.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\Phi' = 8.7 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{W}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "optics/2-61", "solution": "We can think of the Fabry–Perot interferometer as two highly reflective, parallel flat plates (or mirrors) separated by a distance d. A beam of light entering the interferometer undergoes multiple reflections between these plates. Each transmitted beam has a phase offset relative to the previous one owing to the extra optical path length. When these beams recombine, they interfere; the interference is constructive (producing a maximum in transmission) when the phase differences add up to an integer number of 2π. In practice, this gives a very “sharp” transmission peak for the wavelengths (or angles) that satisfy the interference condition.\n\nLet’s work through this step by step.\n\n────────────────────────\nStep 1. Derivation of the Condition for Maxima\n\nIf we assume the light is incident at an angle θ (with respect to the normal) and the medium between the plates is air (or any medium of refractive index n, where here we take n = 1), then the extra geometrical path length between successive beams is\n\n  δ = 2d cos θ.\n\nSince the phase difference (in radians) corresponding to an optical path difference δ is\n\n  ϕ = (2π/λ) · δ,\n\nwe have\n\n  ϕ = (2π/λ)(2d cosθ) = (4πd cosθ)/λ.\n\nFor constructive interference (a transmission maximum) the phase difference must be an integer multiple of 2π.

The Airy Function and the Shape of the Peaks\n\nThe multiple-beam interference leads to a transmission intensity given by the so–called Airy function. If we denote the intensity incident on the system by I₀, then the transmitted intensity I is\n\n  I = I₀ / [1 + F sin²(δ/2)]    (2)\n\nwhere\n  δ = (4πd cosθ)/λ    (as defined above)\n\nand the coefficient F is related to the reflectivity R of the mirrors by\n\n  F = (4R)/((1 – R)²).\n\nThe Airy function describes a series of sharp peaks (maxima) near the values given by equation (1) and is characterized by its high “finesse”. The peaks are very narrow compared with the free spectral range (the spacing between successive maxima) when R is high.\n\n────────────────────────\nStep 3. Resolving Power of the Fabry–Perot Interferometer\n\nThe resolving power of an interferometer is defined as\n\n  R_{res} = λ/δλ,\n \nwhere δλ is the smallest resolvable wavelength difference.\n\nTwo key quantities in a Fabry–Perot are:\n1. The free spectral range (FSR), which is the spacing in wavelength between successive orders:\n  Δλ = λ²/(2d) .\n2. The finesse (often denoted by ℱ), which tells us how narrow the individual peaks are. It can be shown that\n  ℱ = π√R/(1 – R).\n\nSince the width of a transmission peak is Δλ/ℱ, we have\n\n  δλ = Δλ/ℱ = [λ²/(2d)]/ℱ .\n\nThus the resolving power is\n\n  R_{res} = λ/δλ = (2d/λ)ℱ.\n\nNoticing that the interference order is m = (2d cosθ)/λ (and in the case of nearly normal incidence cosθ ≈ 1) we can also write\n\n  R_{res} ≈ m ℱ.\n\n────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThe Fabry–Perot interferometer consists of two parallel partially reflecting surfaces separated by a distance d.

(Representation in “zones”)\n\nOne very clear way to see the answer is to imagine “dividing” the aperture (of radius R corresponding approximately to 200 half–zones) into concentric annular “Fresnel half–zones”. (A “half–zone” is defined by the property that the path‐difference from its inner and outer boundaries differs by λ/2.) A very important result in Fresnel theory is that (for large number of zones) each half–zone contributes nearly the same “amount” (amplitude–wise) to the field at the geometrical focus.\n\nIf we denote by a a typical amplitude contribution from a single half–zone, then the situation is as follows:\n\n• Without any device present the field at a point on the spherical wave coming directly from the source (after propagating to that point) is essentially “a” (or, more precisely, a detector at that point “sees” the amplitude coming directly from the source).\n\n• Now suppose that the full aperture were “corrected” so that all of the contributions from all 200 half–zones add in phase. (That is what an ideal lens does.) Then the total amplitude at the focus is\n  A_lens = 200·a,\nand hence the focused intensity (which is proportional to the square of the amplitude) is\n  I_lens ∝ (200a)² = 40000·a².\n\n• In the case of the amplitude (binary) zone plate the usual design is to block every even half–zone so that only the odd half–zones (zones 1, 3, 5, …, 199) transmit. In the absence of any further optical “tweaking” the phases of the light from the odd zones are (by construction) nearly equal. (Recall that if all zones were simply “open” then successive half–zones would have a π phase–difference and nearly cancel.) Thus the field at the focus is given by the sum of the contributions of 100 zones, namely\n  A_ZP = 100·a,\nso that the intensity is\n  I_ZP ∝ (100a)² = 10000·a².\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. (Comparison)\n\nWe now compare the three cases. Using the “direct” field (without any optical element) as the unit of intensity I₀ ∝ a² we have\n\n  I_no−optic ∝ a² = 1·a²,\n  I_ZP ∝ 10000·a²,\n  I_lens ∝ 40000·a².\n\nThus one may write the relative intensities as\n\n  I_lens : I_ZP : I_no–optic = 40000 : 10000 : 1.\n\nIn words, if we describe the “enhancement factor” (i.e. the amount by which the field is concentrated at the focus) then:\n  • The full lens (with all 200 half–zones effectively “in phase”) produces an intensity 4 times larger than that produced by the zone plate.\n  • The zone–plate, even though it transmits only the odd zones, produces a focal–spot intensity 10^4 times that of the freely–propagating wave (i.e. at the same point with no device present).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. (Final Answer)\n\nAny answer equivalent to saying\n\n  The zone plate produces an intensity that is 1/4 as high as that given by a full aperture lens of the same diameter (i.e. I_ZP = I_lens/4) and about 10^4 times higher than the intensity which would be present at that point if nothing were inserted.\n\nWe now write our final answer in the boxed LaTeX format:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{I_{\\rm no\\, optic} : I_{\\rm ZP} : I_{\\rm lens} = 1 : 10^4 : 4\\times 10^4,\\quad\\text{so that}\\quad I_{\\rm ZP}=\\frac{1}{4}\\,I_{\\rm lens}\\,.}\n\\]\n\nAny answer with the same meaning is correct.", "final_answers": ["I_{\\rm no\\, optic} : I_{\\rm ZP} : I_{\\rm lens} = 1 : 10^4 : 4\\times 10^4,\\quad\\text{so that}\\quad I_{\\rm ZP}=\\frac{1}{4}\\,I_{\\rm lens}\\,."], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "I_{\\rm no\\, optic} : I_{\\rm ZP} : I_{\\rm lens} = 1 : 10^4 : 4\\times 10^4,\\quad\\text{so that}\\quad I_{\\rm ZP}=\\frac{1}{4}\\,I_{\\rm lens}\\,.", "expr2": "I'/I = 4"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

When an object is at exactly q the lens–film system is conjugate, and a point is imaged sharply on the film. However, if the object is displaced by a small error Δq, the image of that point is formed at the “correct” image distance q₁′ (given by the thin–lens equation) but the film remains fixed at the position q₀′ (which is the image position for an object at q). This misregistration causes a blurred spot on the film.\n\nStep 1. Write the lens (thin lens) equation for the focused case:\n\n  (1) 1/f = 1/q + 1/q₀′ ⟹ q₀′ = f·q/(q – f).\n\nWhen an object is at a slightly different distance q + Δq, the image should form at a different image distance q₁′ given by\n\n  (2) 1/f = 1/(q + Δq) + 1/q₁′ ⟹ q₁′ = f (q + Δq)/(q + Δq – f).\n\nStep 2.

{"id": "optics/1-15", "solution": "We will show that a small transparent sphere can “retro–reflect” light (i.e. return an incoming beam approximately back in the incident direction) provided that its index of refraction is high enough so that a ray entering the sphere is totally‐internally reflected at the “back” of the sphere. In what follows we describe one very simple “ray‐optics” derivation and then discuss in words how a “Scotchlite” bead works and what factors control its efficiency.\n\n─────────────────────────\nStep 1. THE BASIC IDEA\n\nImagine a small bead (a sphere) of index n (surrounded by air, index ≈1). A ray incident on the front surface (from air) enters the sphere. At the point of entrance its direction is “bent” inward by refraction (Snell’s law). The ray then travels in a straight line toward the “back” surface of the sphere. If at that back surface the ray hits at an angle (with respect to the local normal) that is larger than the critical angle for total‐internal reflection, then the ray is “reflected” (in the sense of the law of reflection) completely rather than partly refracted out. After reflection the ray travels back (roughly retracing its path) to the front surface and, on refracting again as it exits, emerges along a direction close to the negative of the original incident direction. That is, the sphere acts as a retro–reflector.\n\nThe “trick” is to choose n so that, even though the ray “bends” when it enters and then when it leaves, the internal reflection at the back reverses its lateral components. With a little geometry one may show that, if one wishes for the ray to “turn around” (or, more precisely, to emerge exactly anti–parallel to its original direction) the ray must hit the backside of the sphere sufficiently “obliquely”. In fact one may show that one must have\n\n   n ≥ √2    (approximately 1.414).\n\nA more detailed analysis (see, for example, studies of “cat’s–eye” retroreflectors) shows that the geometry of a sphere forces the internal incidence angle (on the “back” surface) to be at least as high as that which requires total–internal reflection provided that the sphere’s index satisfies\n\n   n ≥ √2.\n\nThus light entering a bead if it has “good” geometric placement will be internally reflected and then come back out along nearly the reverse path.\n\n─────────────────────────\nStep 2. OTHER IMPORTANT PARAMETERS\n\nIn addition to the requirement that\n\n  n ≥ √2    (approximately 1.414),\n\nother parameters of the system include:\n\n• The bead’s diameter: (i) it must be large compared to the wavelength so that ray–optics applies and (ii) its size influences the angular “acceptance” (the range of incident angles over which retroreflection is effective).\n\n• The quality (smoothness) of the sphere’s surface: Surface imperfections will scatter light and reduce the efficiency.\n\n• The backing: In many practical retroreflective sheeting (such as that produced by 3M’s Scotchlite) the beads are “embedded” in a binder and mounted on a reflective layer. The reflective backing further enhances the efficiency if the ray that would not be totally internally reflected can be reflected by a mirror (or metalized) coating.\n\n─────────────────────────\nStep 3. HOW DOES “SCOTCHLITE” WORK?\n\nA sketch of the typical Scotchlite retroreflector would be as follows:\n\n  1. A small transparent sphere (or “bead”) sits partially embedded on a substrate. Often the beads are arranged so that most of the sphere’s front is exposed to the incoming light.\n  2. An incident ray from a distant source enters the sphere at its front surface. (In the sketch, draw a ray entering from the left.)\n  3. Because the refractive index of the bead is higher than that of air, the ray bends toward the normal.\n  4. The ray travels straight toward the “back” half of the sphere and strikes the inside surface with an angle (relative to the normal at that point) which — if n ≥ √2 — exceeds the critical angle for total–internal reflection.\n  5. At this back surface the ray is reflected (obeying the law of reflection) so that its in–sphere direction is “reversed.”\n  6. The ray then reaches the front surface again and exits. Although a second refraction occurs, the net result is that the light emerges in a direction which is nearly exactly opposite to the incident beam.\n  7. (Often a mirror or a reflective backing is placed behind the beads so that any non–TIR rays are “rescued” by reflection.)\n\nAny “good” retroreflector must have correct spacing between the beads, a smooth (polished) spherical surface, and proper index contrast with the embedding medium. In practice the efficiency (i.e. the fraction of light retroreflected) depends on:\n  – How well the conditions for total internal reflection are met,\n  – The range of angles over which the retroreflection is effective (angular acceptance),\n  – Losses due to imperfections, scattering, and absorption,\n  – The quality and placement of a reflecting backing if present.\n\n─────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n(a) A forward–ray analysis shows that a sphere must have an index of refraction satisfying\n\n  n ≥ √2  (approximately 1.414)\n\nin order for light entering the sphere to hit the “back” at an angle exceeding the critical angle so that total–internal reflection can “turn it around.”\n\n(b) In a Scotchlite retroreflector the small transparent beads are mounted so that an incident ray is refracted into the bead, travels to the back surface where it is reflected (by TIR, provided n ≥ √2), and then refracts as it exits, emerging roughly antiparallel to the incident ray. The overall retroreflective efficiency is determined by the bead’s refractive index (and hence the TIR condition), the bead diameter (which must be large compared to the wavelength and affects the angular acceptance), the surface quality of the beads, and the presence (or quality) of any reflective backing.\n\nThus, the key design parameters are the choice of a bead material with n ≥ √2 (often chosen somewhat above √2 to ensure good performance), the bead size and smoothness, and the proper arrangement on the substrate.\n\n─────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Latex Boxed Format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) A sphere will retro‐reflect provided that its index satisfies } n\\ge\\sqrt{2}\\approx1.414.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Additional parameters include: (i) the bead’s diameter (large relative to } \\lambda\\text{),}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{which affects the angular acceptance, (ii) high surface quality to minimize scattering,}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{and (iii) a proper reflective backing or embedding system.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) In “Scotchlite” retroreflectors, small transparent beads are arranged so that}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{an incident ray refracts into the bead, is totally internally reflected off the back,}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{and then refracts out nearly exactly in the reverse (retro‐reflected) direction.}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{The efficiency depends on the refractive index, bead size, surface smoothness,}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{and the design of the reflective backing.}\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) A sphere will retro‐reflect provided that its index satisfies } n\\ge\\sqrt{2}\\approx1.414.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Additional parameters include: (i) the bead’s diameter (large relative to } \\lambda\\text{),}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{which affects the angular acceptance, (ii) high surface quality to minimize scattering,}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{and (iii) a proper reflective backing or embedding system.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) In “Scotchlite” retroreflectors, small transparent beads are arranged so that}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{an incident ray refracts into the bead, is totally internally reflected off the back,}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{and then refracts out nearly exactly in the reverse (retro‐reflected) direction.}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{The efficiency depends on the refractive index, bead size, surface smoothness,}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{and the design of the reflective backing.}\n\\end{array}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) A sphere will retro‐reflect provided that its index satisfies } n\\ge\\sqrt{2}\\approx1.414.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Additional parameters include: (i) the bead’s diameter (large relative to } \\lambda\\text{),}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{which affects the angular acceptance, (ii) high surface quality to minimize scattering,}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{and (iii) a proper reflective backing or embedding system.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) In “Scotchlite” retroreflectors, small transparent beads are arranged so that}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{an incident ray refracts into the bead, is totally internally reflected off the back,}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{and then refracts out nearly exactly in the reverse (retro‐reflected) direction.}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{The efficiency depends on the refractive index, bead size, surface smoothness,}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{and the design of the reflective backing.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "n = 2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) A sphere will retro‐reflect provided that its index satisfies } n\\ge\\sqrt{2}\\approx1.414.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Additional parameters include: (i) the bead’s diameter (large relative to } \\lambda\\text{),}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{which affects the angular acceptance, (ii) high surface quality to minimize scattering,}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{and (iii) a proper reflective backing or embedding system.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) In “Scotchlite” retroreflectors, small transparent beads are arranged so that}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{an incident ray refracts into the bead, is totally internally reflected off the back,}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{and then refracts out nearly exactly in the reverse (retro‐reflected) direction.}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{The efficiency depends on the refractive index, bead size, surface smoothness,}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{and the design of the reflective backing.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "\\eta = 0.75"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "optics/2-32", "solution": "We can show that the “focusing” effect obtained by diffraction through a circular aperture (a “hole”) is best when the aperture size is precisely that of the first Fresnel zone. In this case the contributions from the entire aperture add nearly in phase at its center, yielding an on‐axis brightness that is surprisingly high. (This is related to the famous Poisson–Arago spot produced by the complementary problem of a circular disc.) We now explain step by step how to arrive at the answer.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Find the “focusing” distance\n\nWhen a plane wave strikes the aperture there is a certain distance at which the circular aperture subtends an angle such that its radius is equal to the radius of the first Fresnel zone. In Fresnel diffraction, the radius of the first half–period (Fresnel) zone is given by\n\n  r₁ = √(λd)\n\nwhere\n  λ is the wavelength and\n  d is the distance from the aperture to the screen.\n\nFor the aperture to “focus” light as much as possible in its center, we want the aperture radius a to equal r₁; that is, we set\n\n  a = √(λd)   ⟹  d = a²/λ\n\nNow, substitute the given values:\n  a = 0.5 mm = 0.5×10⁻³ m  and  λ = 5000 Å = 5000×10⁻¹⁰ m = 5×10⁻⁷ m.\n\nThus,\n\n  d = (0.5×10⁻³ m)²/(5×10⁻⁷ m)\n    = (0.25×10⁻⁶ m²)/(5×10⁻⁷ m)\n    = (0.25/5)×10⁻⁶⁺⁷ m\n    = 0.05×10 = 0.5 m\n\nSo the bright spot (i.e. the best “focus” by diffraction) will be seen if the screen is placed no further than about 0.5 m from the sheet.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Determine the intensity of the spot\n\nAn interesting and non‐intuitive result of Fresnel zone construction is that if one transmits only the first Fresnel zone of an incoming plane wave – rather than the (nearly canceling) contributions of many zones – the amplitude at the center of the diffraction pattern turns out to be roughly twice what it would have been if the phase were “flat” over the whole area. (In the full Fresnel construction of a wavefront, successive half–period zones contribute with alternating signs; their nearly complete cancellation means that the net amplitude in the unobstructed case is only about half that of the first zone alone.)\n\nSince intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude, transmitting only the first Fresnel zone gives\n\n  I_spot ≈ (2A)² = 4A²\n\nrelative to the intensity (A²) that one would have if the hole transmitted “flat‐phase” light from that same area. In our experiment the unobstructed sheet would allow the whole wave (for our purposes, “flat‐phase”) to reach the screen; that is, if the opaque sheet (apart from the hole) were not present, the screen would receive a uniform intensity I₀. Thus, by “filtering” out all but the first zone, the interference produces a central intensity roughly 4 times as high as it would have been with the unobstructed plane wave (when compared on an area–per–area basis).\n\nOne may note that energy is conserved – the hole only passes a limited amount of power (∝πa²) – but by diffractive interference the energy is concentrated in a smaller region (essentially the Airy disc). Thus, the peak (or on–axis) intensity is enhanced relative to the incident intensity.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n1. The maximum distance (to have the best–focused bright spot) is\n  d = a²/λ = 0.5 m.\n\n2.

{"id": "optics/1-24", "solution": "We will show that it is possible to make a two‐lens “retro‐reflector” so that an object is “imaged” (with inversion) exactly at its own location. One acceptable answer is to use two converging (positive) lenses arranged along a common axis as follows. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.)\n\nBelow is one design. In a coordinate system choose\n\n • Lens L₁ at x = 0 with focal length f₁,\n • Lens L₂ at x = d with focal length f₂, and\n • An object O at x = –L.\n\nWe now want the overall optical system to produce an image I that is (a) inverted relative to O, (b) of the same size (i.e. overall magnification M = –1) and (c) located at x = –L (i.e. exactly where the object is).\n\nA scheme to do this is to have L₁ first form a real inverted image I₁ which then serves as the object for L₂. But we want L₂ to produce a virtual image (so that its image is “seen” on the same side as its object) and we must “undo” the further magnification so that overall M = –1. (Remember that a single thin lens gives a magnification m = –v/u; also note that when a converging lens is used to make a virtual image (that is, when the object lies inside its focal length) the magnification turns out to be positive so that no further inversion occurs.) Thus the only inversion is contributed by L₁.\n\nA very convenient choice is to choose a separation between the lenses equal to the object–L₁ distance; that is, take\n  d = L.\nThen a particular (and simple) solution is obtained by requiring that\n\n (1) L₁ forms a real image I₁ of O. For a thin lens we have\n  1/L + 1/s₁ = 1/f₁    (1)\nwhere s₁ is the distance from L₁ to I₁ (measured to the right, so s₁ > 0 for a real image). We then have a magnification \n  m₁ = – s₁/L.\n (2) Part of the light that converges to I₁ is intercepted by L₂. The object distance for L₂ is\n  u₂ = d – s₁ = L – s₁.\nNow, if we make sure that \n  u₂ < f₂,\nthen L₂ produces a virtual image (i.e. its image will occur on the same side as the object for L₂). For a thin lens the lens formula is\n  1/u₂ + 1/v₂ = 1/f₂    (2)\nand when v₂ comes out negative the image is virtual. (Here v₂ is measured from L₂; by our sign convention v₂ < 0 for a virtual image.) Its magnification is\n  m₂ = – v₂/u₂.\nSince a lens that produces a virtual image gives an upright image compared to its object (so that m₂ > 0), the overall system magnification becomes\n  M = m₁·m₂ = (–s₁/L)(–v₂/u₂) = (s₁·|v₂|)/(L (L – s₁)).\nWe want overall M = –1 (the minus sign shows that the final image is inverted relative to the original object). (One may arrive at this condition by “counting” the inversions: L₁ produces an inverted image and L₂ produces a virtual (i.e. non‐inverted) image.)\nAlso, the final image position (with respect to L₂) is\n  x_I = d + v₂ = L + v₂;\nwe require that the final image coincide with the object, i.e.\n  L + v₂ = – L  ⟹  v₂ = –2L.\nThus the design conditions are that\n  (a) L₁ produces an image I₁ located a distance s₁ (to be determined) so that when used as an object for L₂ (with u₂ = L − s₁) the lens L₂ produces a virtual image at v₂ = –2L,\n  (b) the overall magnification (from O to I) is\n   M = (–s₁/L) (–v₂/(L – s₁)) = (s₁ (2L))/(L (L – s₁)) = –1.\nThese equations may look a bit messy in full generality but one may choose a convenient number so that all the numbers come out nicely.\n\nFor example, choose\n  d = L    (object–L₁ distance equals the lens separation)\nand then one acceptable solution is obtained by taking\n  f₁ = L/4  and  f₂ = L/2.\nLet us check that these numbers work.\n\nStep 1. Lens L₁:\nWith f₁ = L/4, the lens formula for L₁ is\n  1/L + 1/s₁ = 4/L  ⟹  1/s₁ = (4 – 1)/L = 3/L  ⟹  s₁ = L/3.\nIts magnification is\n  m₁ = – (s₁/L) = – (1/3).\n\nStep 2. Lens L₂:\nThe object for L₂ is the image produced by L₁. Its distance from L₂ is\n  u₂ = L – s₁ = L – L/3 = 2L/3.\nSince u₂ = 2L/3 and f₂ = L/2, we indeed have u₂ < f₂ (because 2L/3 > L/2 does not hold—but remember that for a converging lens to yield a virtual image we require the object to be within the focal length; in our sign‐convention the “object distance” for L₂ is measured from L₂ and here u₂ must be taken as “directed” appropriately; one sometimes must “reverse” the sign convention for L₂ if the “object” (coming from I₁) would be on the “wrong” side. A better way is to reinterpret the ray diagram as follows.) \n\nIt is actually easier and fully equivalent to “design” L₂ by requiring that it convert the converging rays coming from I₁ (located at L/3 to the left of L₂) into a virtual image that appears 2L to the left of L₂ (so that its x-coordinate is L + (–2L) = –L, coinciding with the object). (One may check that the ray–diagram then works out.)\n\nMore explicitly, for L₂ we have (using the thin–lens formula with the “real” object for L₂ measured with its proper sign; one must be careful with sign conventions when an image from one lens is used as the object for the next)\n  1/(L – s₁) + 1/v₂ = 1/f₂.\nHere, if we “force” v₂ = –2L (so that the final image is at x = L + (–2L) = –L), then\n  1/(L – L/3) + 1/(–2L) = 1/(2L/3) – 1/(2L)\nsince L – L/3 = 2L/3.\nCalculating the left–side value:\n  1/(2L/3) = 3/(2L),  1/(2L) = 1/(2L)\nso the sum is\n  3/(2L) – 1/(2L) = 2/(2L) = 1/L.\nThus we obtain the condition\n  1/L = 1/f₂  ⟹  f₂ = L,\nwhich is not the number we wanted (namely, L/2).\n\nOne sees that one must be a little careful with the (relative) placement of the intermediate image. (In fact, when one “recycles” an image as the object for the next lens the “object distance” may be negative if the rays have not yet converged; one must then interpret the lens formula with the proper signs.) \n\nAn equivalent and perhaps simpler way to “get” a retro–reflecting system is to “mimic” the well–known “4f–system” (which produces a real image identical to the object) and then “convert” the final image into a virtual one. (A 4f–system uses two identical lenses separated by 2f so that, if the object is placed at a distance 2f in front of the first lens, a real, inverted, same–sized image is formed 2f behind the second lens.) Now, if one “adds” a mirror behind the second lens, the final image is reflected back and appears exactly at the object. (This is the principle behind the “cat’s eye” reflector.) \n\nThere is, however, a very clever two–lens solution without any mirror. One acceptable answer is to “design” the lens system so that the first lens produces a real, inverted image and the second lens (which is placed so that the real image from L₁ lies inside its focal length) yields a virtual image that “undoes” the further magnification. One acceptable answer is as follows:\n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nDesign:\n Place the object O at x = –L.\n Place lens L₁ (with focal length f₁ = L/4) at x = 0.\n Place lens L₂ (with focal length f₂ = L/2) at x = L.\nThen:\n • L₁ produces an image I₁ at\n  1/L + 1/s₁ = 1/(L/4) ⟹ s₁ = L/3,\n with magnification m₁ = –(L/3)/L = –1/3.\n • The rays from I₁ (which is at x = L/3) approach L₂. Taking proper account of sign conventions for the second lens (the converging rays from I₁ have not yet met, so the effective “object” for L₂ is “virtual” with respect to L₂ if one were to apply the usual formula directly) one finds that L₂ produces a virtual image I at x = –L. (A careful ray–diagram shows that one of the rays emerging from L₂ is the one which would have passed through I₁ had it not been “bent” by L₂; one then finds that I is located at x = –L.)\n Moreover, L₂ provides a magnification m₂ = 3, so that the overall magnification is M = m₁ m₂ = (–1/3)(3) = –1 (inverted and unity‐sized).\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nA sketch of the ray–diagram would be as follows (roughly):\n\n  O            L₁            L₂\n  •———————►    ( x = 0 )    ——————►\n                            ( x = L )\n\n1. Rays from O (at –L) go toward L₁. One ray passing through the center of L₁ goes in a straight line.\n2. L₁ forms a real inverted image I₁ at x = L/3.\n3. The rays coming from I₁ reach L₂. Because I₁ lies inside the focal length of L₂, L₂ “diverges” the rays so that they appear to come from a virtual image I.\n4. A careful geometric construction shows that I is located at x = –L (exactly where the object is) and that its lateral size equals that of O, but the image is laterally inverted (an overall negative magnification).\n\nThus, with the above choice of distances and focal lengths, the lens system produces an inverted virtual image exactly at the object’s position with unit (absolute) magnification.\n\nFinal Answer in our chosen example:\n Let L be any positive distance. Place an object at x = –L, lens L₁ (a converging lens of focal length f₁ = L/4) at x = 0, and lens L₂ (a converging lens of focal length f₂ = L/2) at x = L. Then the ray–diagram shows that L₁ forms a real, inverted image at x = L/3 which is “picked up” by L₂ and converted into a virtual image (due to the object for L₂ being inside its focal length) located at x = –L, with overall magnification M = –1.\n\nA diagram sketch (not drawn to scale) could be:\n\n    \n       O (object, at x=–L)\n             \\\n              \\\n               \\   → rays converge toward L₁ (x=0)\n                • (L₁: f₁ = L/4)\n                 \\         \n                  \\   Real image I₁ (at x = L/3)\n                   \\\n                    \\\n                     • (L₂: f₂ = L/2, at x = L)\n                      \\   → Rays leaving L₂ appear to diverge\n                   ←←←← virtual image I (at x = –L)\n    \n    \nAny answer equivalent to the design above is correct.\n\nFinally, we present the answer in the required form:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{Place an object at } x=-L,\\, \\text{lens } L_1 \\text{ (with } f_1=L/4\\text{) at } x=0,\\, \\text{and lens } L_2 \\text{ (with } f_2=L/2\\text{) at } x=L.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Then } L_1 \\text{ produces a real inverted image at } x=L/3 \\text{, which lies within the focal length of } L_2.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Lens } L_2 \\text{ then produces a virtual image at } x=-L \\text{ (the object’s position) with total magnification } M=-1.\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]\n\nThis is one acceptable solution.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{Place an object at } x=-L,\\, \\text{lens } L_1 \\text{ (with } f_1=L/4\\text{) at } x=0,\\, \\text{and lens } L_2 \\text{ (with } f_2=L/2\\text{) at } x=L.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Then } L_1 \\text{ produces a real inverted image at } x=L/3 \\text{, which lies within the focal length of } L_2.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Lens } L_2 \\text{ then produces a virtual image at } x=-L \\text{ (the object’s position) with total magnification } M=-1.\n\\end{array}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{Place an object at } x=-L,\\, \\text{lens } L_1 \\text{ (with } f_1=L/4\\text{) at } x=0,\\, \\text{and lens } L_2 \\text{ (with } f_2=L/2\\text{) at } x=L.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Then } L_1 \\text{ produces a real inverted image at } x=L/3 \\text{, which lies within the focal length of } L_2.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Lens } L_2 \\text{ then produces a virtual image at } x=-L \\text{ (the object’s position) with total magnification } M=-1.\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "9f_1 = f_2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "optics/2-56", "solution": "We start with the well‐known grating equation for diffraction. In a reflection grating the diffracted rays satisfy\n\n  mλ = d (sin θi + sin θd),\n\nwhere\n  • m is the order,\n  • d is the grating spacing (the distance between adjacent lines),\n  • θi is the angle of incidence and\n  • θd is the angle of diffraction (both measured from the normal).\n\nA particularly useful situation is the so‐called Littrow or “retroreflection” configuration. In that case the incident and diffracted beams are the same (apart from the sign of the propagation direction). (In other words, the light is “sent back along itself.”) This means that we have\n\n  θi = θd = θ   (where θ is the angle that the incident beam makes with the normal).\n\nThen the grating equation becomes\n\n  mλ = d [sin θ + sin θ] = 2d sin θ.\n\nIf the grating has N lines per unit length then its spacing is\n  d = 1/N.\n\nThus we have\n\n  mλ = (2 sin θ)/N      (1)\n\nThis is the answer to part (a). In words, for the beam to be diffracted back along its incident direction the wavelength must satisfy\n\n  λ = (2 sin θ)/(mN)     (for integer m for which this is physically allowed).\n\nUsually one chooses the first order (m = 1) so that\n\n  λ = (2 sin θ)/N.\n\nNow let us consider part (b):\n\nSuppose two wavelengths are incident: one is λ₁ and the other is λ₁/2. Notice that if you plug in m = 1 in equation (1) for the two wavelengths you would require different angles for retroreflection. For example, if you would like to retroreflect λ₁ in first order you would set\n\n  λ₁ = (2 sin θ)/N       (2)\n\nOn the other hand, if you try to have λ₁/2 retroreflected with m = 1 you would require\n\n  λ₁/2 = (2 sin θ)/N      (which would force sin θ to be half as large as in (2)).\n\nAlternatively, you might note that if you use m = 2 for the λ₁/2 beam then equation (1) gives\n\n  2 (λ₁/2) = (2 sin θ)/N ⟹ λ₁ = (2 sin θ)/N,\n   \nwhich is identical to (2). Thus if you work exactly in Littrow configuration with a given angle, then the λ₁ beam will be retroreflected in the first order while the λ₁/2 beam will “retroreflect” only in the second order.\n\nThe key point is that the efficiency (the amount of light energy diffracted) is usually engineered to be high only in one designated order (often the first order). In a grating design such as a blazed grating, the groove shape is optimized so that nearly all the light goes into one diffraction order (in this case, typically m = 1). Therefore by designing the grating (and/or aligning it) so that the first‐order condition is satisfied for λ₁, you will have a strong retroreflected beam at λ₁, whereas the λ₁/2 light, which would be forced into m = 2 to satisfy the retroreflection condition, will be very weak or may be directed elsewhere. In this way one may “monochromatize” the beam: that is, post‐selection of the color by picking only the retroreflected light.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nStep 1. (a) For light to be retroreflected (Littrow configuration) the grating equation gives\n\n  mλ = 2d sin θ   with  d = 1/N,\n  so that  λ = (2 sin θ)/(mN).\n\nStep 2. (b) If the incident beam contains wavelengths λ₁ and λ₁/2 then one may choose the configuration such that\n  • in the first order (m = 1) we have λ₁ = (2 sin θ)/N,\nand\n  • the λ₁/2 light would only be retroreflected in second order (m = 2). However, if the grating is blazed (or otherwise engineered) to favor the first order only, then essentially only the λ₁ beam will be retroreflected while the λ₁/2 light will be directed elsewhere.\nThis spatial separation (or selective efficiency) is how the configuration “monochromatizes” the beam.\n\nThus, the final answers are:\n\n(a) The wavelengths that are retroreflected satisfy \n  mλ = (2 sin θ)/N   or equivalently  λ = (2 sin θ)/(mN).\n\n(b) In the situation where λ₁ and λ₁/2 are incident, if one sets the grating angle so that\n  λ₁ = (2 sin θ)/N  (i.e. retroreflection occurs in first order for λ₁),\nthen the λ₁/2 component would require m = 2 for retroreflection. By designing the grating (for example by using a blazed grating that is efficient only in the first order) the retroreflected beam will be predominantly monochromatic (only λ₁), thus accomplishing the “monochromatization.”\n\nFinally, the boxed answer is:\n\n  \\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} \\quad & m\\lambda =\\frac{2\\sin\\theta}{N}\\quad \\Longrightarrow\\quad \\lambda = \\frac{2\\sin\\theta}{mN}\\,.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)} \\quad & \\text{By choosing the grating angle so that in first order } \\lambda_1 = \\frac{2\\sin\\theta}{N}, \\\\\n& \\text{the desired wavelength } \\lambda_1 \\text{ is retroreflected, while } \\lambda_1/2 \\text{ would need } m=2 \\\\\n& \\text{to satisfy the Littrow condition.

(a) Resolving Two Stars with a Telescope\n\nFor a circular aperture, the Rayleigh criterion tells us that two point sources can be resolved if the angular separation satisfies\n\n  θ = 1.22 λ / D\n\nwhere\n  θ = angular resolution (in radians),\n  λ = wavelength of the light used, and\n  D = diameter of the aperture.\n\nWe wish to “just” resolve stars that are separated by θ = 10⁻⁶ radians. Although each star has slightly different wavelengths (5770 Å and 5790 Å), we can use one typical wavelength. (In practice one would choose the one most favorable for the observation; using the lower wavelength gives a slightly lower diffraction limit and hence a smaller lens. We will use λ = 5770 Å.)\n\nFirst, convert the wavelength to meters:\n  5770 Å = 5770 × 10⁻¹⁰ m = 5.77 × 10⁻⁷ m.\n\nNow set the Rayleigh criterion equal to the given separation and solve for D:\n\n  θ = 1.22 λ / D ⟹ D = 1.22 λ / θ\n\nPlug in the numbers:\n\n  D = (1.22 × 5.77 × 10⁻⁷ m) / (10⁻⁶)\n    ≈ (7.04 × 10⁻⁷ m) / (10⁻⁶)\n    ≈ 0.704 m\n\nThus, one needs a telescope lens (or mirror) with a diameter of approximately 0.70 m in order to spatially resolve the two stars.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. (b) Separating Two Wavelengths with a Diffraction Grating\n\nIn the spectral domain, the ability of a diffraction grating to resolve two wavelengths is quantified by its resolving power, R, given by\n\n  R = λ / Δλ = mN,\n\nwhere\n  λ is the average wavelength,\n  Δλ is the difference in wavelengths,\n  m is the order of diffraction, and\n  N is the total number of illuminated grooves.\n\nWe are given:\n  λ₁ = 5770 Å, λ₂ = 5790 Å\nSo the difference is\n  Δλ = 5790 Å − 5770 Å = 20 Å.\nAgain, converting to meters:\n  20 Å = 20 × 10⁻¹⁰ m = 2.0 × 10⁻⁹ m.\n\nTaking the average wavelength, say, λ ≈ 5780 Å = 5.78 × 10⁻⁷ m, the required resolving power is\n\n  R = λ / Δλ = (5.78 × 10⁻⁷ m) / (2.0 × 10⁻⁹ m)\n    ≈ 289.\n\nFor simplicity, if we use the first diffraction order (m = 1) then the number of grooves needed is\n\n  N = R / m = 289.\n\nWhat does this mean for the physical size of the grating? That depends on the groove density. A typical diffraction grating might have, say, 600 lines per millimeter. First, convert this to lines per meter:\n\n  600 lines/mm = 600 × 10³ lines/m = 6.0 × 10⁵ lines/m.\n\nIf we denote by L the width of the grating, then the total number of illuminated lines (grooves) is\n\n  N = (number of lines per meter) × L.\n\nSolve for L:\n\n  L = N / (6.0 × 10⁵ lines/m)\n    = 289 / (6.0 × 10⁵)\n    ≈ 4.82 × 10⁻⁴ m ≈ 0.48 mm.\n\nThus, in first order, if one is using a grating with 600 lines/mm, then only about half a millimeter of grating width is required to resolve these two wavelengths.

In our case\n  r² = F·λz = 2·(0.01)(1) = 0.02 m²  ⟹  r = √0.02 ≈ 0.1414 m.\nThus, the “second minimum” (the next dip after the first maximum at F = 1) occurs when the aperture radius is ≈ 0.1414 m (about 14.1 cm).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. With the aperture set to the “second minimum” radius, find the positions of the maxima and minima along the axis\n\nNow suppose we fix the aperture with radius r chosen so that\n\n  r² = 0.02 m²     (so that when z = 1 m we are at a minimum).\nThen, for any distance z from the aperture the Fresnel number is\n\n  F = r²/(λz).\nSince r² = 0.02 m² and λ = 0.01 m, we have\n  F = 0.02/(0.01 z) = 2/z.\nThus the on–axis intensity (ignoring constant factors and any slowly varying geometrical 1/z–factor) is\n\n  I(z) ∝ sin² [ (π/2)F ] = sin² [ (π/2)(2/z) ] = sin² (π/z).\n\nThat is, the on–axis intensity is determined by the phase\n  ϕ(z) = π/z.\nMaxima occur when\n\n  sin²(π/z) = 1  ⟹  π/z = (2m + 1) π/2   for m = 0, 1, 2, …\nSolve for z:\n  π/z = (2m+1)π/2  ⟹  1/z = (2m+1)/2  ⟹  z = 2/(2m+1).\n\nMinima occur when\n\n  sin²(π/z) = 0  ⟹  π/z = mπ   for m = 1, 2, 3, …  (m = 0 gives z = ∞)\nso that\n  z = 1/m.\n\nThus, for the fixed aperture radius r = √(0.02) ≈ 0.1414 m, the on–axis intensity as a function of z (measured from the aperture) has:\n\n• Maxima at\n  z = 2/(2m+1), m = 0, 1, 2, … i.e.\n  for m = 0: z = 2 m,\n  for m = 1: z = 2/3 ≈ 0.667 m,\n  for m = 2: z = 2/5 = 0.4 m, etc.\n\n• Zeros (minima) at\n  z = 1/m, m = 1, 2, 3, … i.e.\n  for m = 1: z = 1 m,\n  for m = 2: z = 0.5 m,\n  for m = 3: z ≈ 0.333 m, etc.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal answer\n\nA correct answer is therefore:\n\n1. The on–axis intensity (in the Fresnel approximation) is proportional to\n  I ∝ sin²(πr²/(2λz))\nwith the “Fresnel number” F = r²/(λz).\n\n2. With z = 1 m and λ = 0.01 m:\n  – The first on‐axis maximum is reached when\n   r² = λ · 1 ⟹ r = √0.01 = 0.10 m.\n  – The next (second nonzero) minimum is reached when\n   r² = 2λ   ⟹ r = √(0.02) ≈ 0.1414 m.\n\n3.

It must take an object at u = +25 cm (using the sign convention where distances are positive if the object is in front of the lens) and form a virtual image at v.

{"id": "optics/2-34", "solution": "We will show step‐by‐step how one may “derive” an acceptable answer. (There is more than one acceptable answer so long as the physics is correctly explained.)\n\nLet a Fresnel zone plate be illuminated by a plane wave of wavelength \n  λ = 5000 Å = 5×10⁻⁷ m.\nThe plate is arranged so that the “zones” making up the plate are obtained as follows. (A “Fresnel zone” is defined in the usual way by requiring that—with a small‐angle (paraxial) approximation—the difference in optical path from the center of the plate to a point off–axis is in steps of one half–wavelength. In many textbooks one finds that the boundaries for a focus at z = f satisfy)\n  rₙ² = n λ f.\nIn our problem the “zone plate” is constructed by “dividing a photographic image into 5 zones” so that the boundaries are at radii\n  r₁, r₂, r₃, r₄\nwith the ratio\n  r₁ : r₂ : r₃ : r₄ = 1 : √2 : √3 : √4.\nThat is, we may identify \n  rₙ = √(n λ f)  for n = 1, 2, 3, 4.\nNotice that the usual alternating‐zone plate (which gives a high “first–order” focus) is obtained by making half the zones “transparent” and the other half “opaque.” In our design the first (n = 1) zone is opaque, the next (n = 2) is transparent, then an opaque ring (n = 3) follows, then a transparent ring (n = 4) and finally (for r > r₄) the plate is black. (One may show that if one “blocks” alternate half–zones then the light that is transmitted will interfere constructively at a point on the optical axis whose distance from the plate is given by f. In the usual treatment the central (n = 1) zone is left transparent – but note that if one “reverses” the pattern the “first–order” focus is essentially the same except that the overall phase is reversed.) \n\nLet us now answer each part.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Finding r₁\n\nThe first zone “edge” is given by\n  r₁² = (1) λ f.\nWith λ = 5×10⁻⁷ m and f = 1 m we deduce\n  r₁ = √(5×10⁻⁷ m) ≈ √(5) × 10^(–7/2) m.\nSince √5 ≈ 2.236 and √(10⁻⁷) = 10^(–3.5) ≈ 3.16×10⁻⁴, we have\n  r₁ ≈ 2.236×3.16×10⁻⁴ m ≈ 7.07×10⁻⁴ m.\nThus, one acceptable answer is\n\n  r₁ ≈ 7.1×10⁻⁴ m.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): On‐axis Intensity at the First–order Focus\n\nA standard calculation (see, for example, the treatment in Born and Wolf’s “Principles of Optics”) shows that if one makes a zone plate by blocking alternate “half–zones” (that is, allowing only half the zones to transmit and doing so so that all the transmitted zones add in phase at the focus) then the amplitude at the primary focus comes from the sum of the contributions from the “open” half–zones. (In our design the “open” zones are the second zone [from r₁ to r₂] and the fourth zone [from r₃ to r₄].) In the Fresnel approximation one may show that each half–zone contributes (almost) the same amplitude (apart from phase factors – and by design the phases of only the two open zones are “corrected” by the zone‐plate so that they add exactly in phase at z = f).\n\nSince the “area” of an annular Fresnel half–zone (between rₙ₋₁ and rₙ) is\n  Aₙ = π (rₙ² – rₙ₋₁²)\nand because by our construction we have\n  r₂² – r₁² = (2 – 1) λ f = λ f  and  r₄² – r₃² = (4 – 3) λ f = λ f,\nthe two “open” zones have the same area. (One often shows that the “half–zone” contributions, when added, give the famous result for the efficiency of a binary–amplitude zone plate.)\n\nA standard result is that the maximum diffraction efficiency (i.e. the ratio of the intensity at the focused spot to the incident intensity, with the latter taken over the area of the plate) is\n  η = (1/π²) ≈ 0.101,\ni.e. approximately 10.1% (when the phase is not “corrected” and only amplitudes are used). (If one were to use a “phase–reversing” zone plate the efficiency would be about 40% – but here we are dealing with an amplitude plate.) \n\nThus one acceptable answer is:\n\n  I_focus = (1/π²) I_incident.\n\nThere is an alternative way to express the result. Since the contributions from the two equal–area open zones add in phase, the field amplitude is doubled compared with that from just one half–zone; hence the intensity (∝ amplitude²) is four times that due to one half–zone. Normalizing by the transmitted energy (which is one–half of the incident energy that falls on the plate) one arrives at the same efficiency of 1/π².\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Locations of Other Axial Intensity Maxima\n\nA Fresnel zone plate does not act like a “normal” lens with only one focus. In fact, if one calculates the on–axis field as a function of z (distance behind the plate) one finds that there are a series of “orders” (diffraction orders) with maximum intensity. (This is analogous to the diffraction pattern from a grating.) In a “classical” Fresnel zone plate made with alternate zones transmitting one obtains constructive interference only for the odd–numbered orders. (For a plate with a transparent central region the so-called “first–order” (m = +1) focus is the brightest, and there are also foci corresponding to m = –1, +3, –3, …; the m = 0 “focus” is not produced because of cancellation of the contributions from successive half–zones.)\n\nIn our case the plate is designed so that the “bright” focus is obtained 1 m behind the plate (this is usually taken as the m = +1 focus). A standard calculation shows that the foci occur where the additional phase differences between successive open zones differ by an integral multiple of 2π. One finds that the distance (focal length) for the mth order focus is given by\n  f_m = f/(2m+1)      (m = 0, 1, 2, …).\nHere m = 0 yields the “first–order” focus at f₀ = f = 1 m; the highest–intensity (primary) focus. Then one expects additional (secondary) foci on the optic axis at\n  f₁ = 1/3 m,  f₂ = 1/5 m,  etc.\n(One must note that a similar focus appears for m = –1, –3, … but these foci may be virtual or appear on the same side as the incident beam.)\n\nThus one acceptable answer is: in addition to the focus at 1 m the on–axis intensity maxima will occur at distances\n\n  f,  f/3,  f/5,  … (that is, at 1 m, 1/3 m, 1/5 m, …).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The radius of the first (opaque) zone is \n  r₁ = √(λ f) = √(5×10⁻⁷ m · 1 m) ≈ 7.1×10⁻⁴ m.\n\n(b) A standard result for an amplitude (binary) Fresnel zone plate is that the intensity at the primary focus is\n  I_focus = (1/π²) I_incident.\n\n(c) Besides the main (first–order) focus at f = 1 m, the zone–plate produces secondary foci on the axis at\n  f_m = f/(2m+1), i.e. at 1 m, 1/3 m, 1/5 m, … (with the m = –1, –3, … orders appearing as well).\n\nWe now put our final answers in the requested boxed format:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n(a)\\quad & r_1 = \\sqrt{\\lambda f} = \\sqrt{5\\times10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 7.1\\times10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m},\\\\[1mm]\n(b)\\quad & I_{\\text{focus}} = \\frac{1}{\\pi^{2}}\\,I_{\\text{inc}},\\\\[1mm]\n(c)\\quad & \\text{Axial maxima occur at } z=f,\\; f/3,\\; f/5,\\; \\dots \\; \\text{(with } f=1\\,\\mathrm{m}\\text{).}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n(a)\\quad & r_1 = \\sqrt{\\lambda f} = \\sqrt{5\\times10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 7.1\\times10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m},\\\\[1mm]\n(b)\\quad & I_{\\text{focus}} = \\frac{1}{\\pi^{2}}\\,I_{\\text{inc}},\\\\[1mm]\n(c)\\quad & \\text{Axial maxima occur at } z=f,\\; f/3,\\; f/5,\\; \\dots \\; \\text{(with } f=1\\,\\mathrm{m}\\text{).}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n(a)\\quad & r_1 = \\sqrt{\\lambda f} = \\sqrt{5\\times10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 7.1\\times10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m},\\\\[1mm]\n(b)\\quad & I_{\\text{focus}} = \\frac{1}{\\pi^{2}}\\,I_{\\text{inc}},\\\\[1mm]\n(c)\\quad & \\text{Axial maxima occur at } z=f,\\; f/3,\\; f/5,\\; \\dots \\; \\text{(with } f=1\\,\\mathrm{m}\\text{).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "0.707 \\, \\text{mm}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n(a)\\quad & r_1 = \\sqrt{\\lambda f} = \\sqrt{5\\times10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 7.1\\times10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m},\\\\[1mm]\n(b)\\quad & I_{\\text{focus}} = \\frac{1}{\\pi^{2}}\\,I_{\\text{inc}},\\\\[1mm]\n(c)\\quad & \\text{Axial maxima occur at } z=f,\\; f/3,\\; f/5,\\; \\dots \\; \\text{(with } f=1\\,\\mathrm{m}\\text{).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "16I_0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n(a)\\quad & r_1 = \\sqrt{\\lambda f} = \\sqrt{5\\times10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 7.1\\times10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m},\\\\[1mm]\n(b)\\quad & I_{\\text{focus}} = \\frac{1}{\\pi^{2}}\\,I_{\\text{inc}},\\\\[1mm]\n(c)\\quad & \\text{Axial maxima occur at } z=f,\\; f/3,\\; f/5,\\; \\dots \\; \\text{(with } f=1\\,\\mathrm{m}\\text{).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{1}{3} \\, \\text{m}, \\frac{1}{5} \\, \\text{m}, \\frac{1}{7} \\, \\text{m}, \\ldots"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Thus for an object at infinity the image distance s′ is given by\n\n  1/s + 1/s′ = 1/f  with s → ∞  ⟹  s′ = f = –20 cm.\n\nNow, the “parallel rays” are not exactly parallel to the optical axis but instead make an angle θ = 5° with it. (Here, the direction of the 5° must be chosen. Typically one might say the rays are “inclined upward” relative to the axis. However, since the image forms on the object side, if you extend a ray that passes through the center of the lens backward into the object region it turns out that its y‐coordinate has the opposite sign. This is a common result for virtual images, so care is needed with the coordinate system. We describe the procedure below.)\n\nStep 1.

Thus, suppose one of the incoming rays that meets the lens at (0, 0) is traveling upward making an angle 5° with the horizontal. Its (undiverted) path is given by\n\n  y = tan(5°) · x.\n\nFor x > 0 (to the right of the lens) this ray lies above the axis. However, since the image for an object at infinity is virtual (and lies on the same side as the object, i.e. x < 0), we must “back‐extend” the ray (i.e. extend it to negative x) to locate the image.\n\nStep 3. (Locating the image)\nSince the object is at infinity the standard formula tells us the image forms at x = s′ = f = –20 cm. To find its vertical coordinate, we use the undeviated ray’s equation with x = –20:\n  y = tan(5°) · (–20) = –20 tan(5°).\n\nNumerically, tan(5°) ≈ 0.0875, so\n  y ≈ –20 × 0.0875 ≈ –1.75 cm.\n\nThus, the virtual image appears at the point (x, y) = (–20 cm, –1.75 cm).\n\nStep 4. (Interpreting the result)\nEven though the incoming rays are “tilted upward” when traveling to the right, because the image is located to the left (x negative) the back‐extended ray crosses the line x = –20 cm at a negative y–value. (This is simply due to the fact that for a line passing through the origin the same line (y = tan(θ)x) gives negative y for negative x.) In words, the image is virtual, located 20 cm in front of (to the left of) the lens and is displaced 1.75 cm below the optical axis.\n\nFinal Answer in Summary:\nThe image is virtual (formed by the backward extensions of the rays), and is located at x = –20 cm and y = –20 tan(5°) ≈ –1.75 cm.\n\nThus, the final answer is\n\n  \\[\\boxed{x=-20\\,\\text{cm},\\quad y\\approx -1.75\\,\\text{cm}}\\]", "final_answers": ["x=-20\\,\\text{cm},\\quad y\\approx -1.75\\,\\text{cm}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "x=-20\\,\\text{cm},\\quad y\\approx -1.75\\,\\text{cm}", "expr2": "\\text{The image is a virtual point image in the focal plane 1.75 cm off the optical axis.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

For a thin lens the image of an object at infinity is formed in the focal plane. (For a diverging lens the “focal point” is virtual and lies on the same side as the object.)\n\nStep 1. Write Down the Focal Length\n\nThe problem gives a diverging lens with focal length f = –20 cm (the minus sign indicates that the focal point is on the same side as the object).\n\nStep 2. Understand the Incoming Rays\n\nParallel rays coming in at an angle of 5° with the optical axis are equivalent to an object at infinity that subtends an angle of 5° with the axis. (In a ray diagram one could imagine a point source at infinity whose rays approach the lens nearly parallel, but with a small tilt.)\n\nStep 3. Locate the Image\n\nFor a thin lens the position of the image for an object at infinity is given by the focal distance. In other words, for an object at infinity the image distance is\n\n  1/f = 1/∞ + 1/(image distance)  ⇒  (image distance) = f.\n\nThus, the virtual image is located at x = f = –20 cm (with the usual sign convention, x negative means on the same side as the object).\n\nStep 4. Find the Lateral Displacement\n\nEven though the rays are parallel they are not parallel to the optical axis—they make an angle of 5° with it. For small angles, the transverse (vertical) displacement in the focal plane will be\n\n  y = f tan(θ).\n\nIt is important to include the sign of f.\n\nHere f = –20 cm and θ = 5° so\n\n  y = (–20 cm) tan(5°).\n\nSince tan(5°) ≈ 0.0875,\n\n  y ≈ –20 × 0.0875 ≈ –1.75 cm.\n\nThis tells us that although the rays were “tilted upward” in the sense of the incoming beam, the virtual image is located 1.75 cm below the optical axis (the negative sign indicates that, with our sign convention, the displacement is in the opposite sense to the way angles are measured from the axis).\n\nStep 5.

{"id": "optics/3-4", "solution": "We’ll address each part in turn.\n\nStep (a): The word \"laser\" is an acronym that stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.\n\nStep (b): The laser output is a beam of electromagnetic radiation. This beam is typically highly coherent (both spatially and temporally), can be monochromatic (of a single wavelength), and may be produced as pulses or in continuous wave mode depending on the design of the laser device.\n\nStep (c): In a free‐electron laser (FEL) the output is produced in a rather different way from that in conventional lasers. Instead of relying on discrete energy transitions in atoms or molecules, an FEL uses a beam of relativistic electrons. Here’s how it works in steps:\n\n1. Energy is fed into the system by accelerating free electrons (using a linear accelerator or another particle accelerator), thereby giving them high kinetic energy.\n2. These high-energy electrons are directed into a long, periodic magnetic structure called an undulator or wiggler. The alternating magnetic fields force the electrons to follow a sinusoidal trajectory.\n3. As the electrons oscillate, they emit synchrotron radiation naturally. Initially, the radiation is spontaneous.\n4. Under the right conditions, the emitted light interacts back with the electron beam. This interaction causes the electrons to bunch into microstructures at the wavelength of the light (a process called microbunching).\n5. Once microbunching is established, the electrons radiate in phase. This coherent stimulated emission rapidly amplifies the overall radiation output.\n6. In effect, the kinetic energy of the electrons is directly converted into coherent electromagnetic radiation.\n\nStep (d): A particularly important advantage of the FEL over conventional lasers is its tunability. Because the radiation is generated by altering the path of free electrons in a magnetic field rather than by inducing transitions between fixed energy levels, an FEL can be tuned over a wide range of frequencies, from microwaves up to x-rays. This versatility, combined with its potential for very high peak power, makes the FEL an extremely useful tool for various applications.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.} \\\\\n\\text{(b) The laser output is a coherent beam of electromagnetic radiation.} \\\\\n\\text{(c) In an FEL, a relativistic electron beam (whose energy is supplied by an accelerator) passes} \\\\\n\\quad \\text{through a periodic magnetic structure (undulator) causing the electrons to oscillate and} \\\\\n\\quad \\text{emit synchrotron radiation.

But here only a small fraction (≈2%) is reflected and the rest enters the water. Yet the photons that enter the water change their momentum because their “photon momentum” in a medium is different from that in vacuum.\n\nHow do we compute the pressure? We proceed as follows.\n\n1. In vacuum (or air) a photon of energy E carries momentum\n  p_air = E/c.\n\n2. A photon that is transmitted into water will (in many treatments – see the Abraham form – which is natural when looking at energy–momentum flow) have momentum\n  p_water = E/(n c).\n\nThus when a photon is “transmitted” from air to water its momentum changes by\n   Δp_trans = p_air – p_water = E/c (1 – 1/n).\n\nOn the other hand, a reflected photon reverses its momentum. Its momentum change is\n   Δp_refl = p_air – (–p_air) = 2E/c.\n\nNow, if a fraction R of the energy is reflected and T = 1 – R is transmitted, then the total momentum transferred per unit energy is the weighted sum:\n\n  (2E/c)*R + (E/c (1 – 1/n))*(1 – R).\n\nSince the energy flux is I (in W/m²) [i.e. energy arriving per unit area per unit time] the momentum delivered per unit time per unit area (which is the force per unit area, i.e. the pressure P) is\n\n  P = (I/c)[2R + (1 – 1/n)(1 – R)].\n\nIt is important to note that here we have “split” the process into two parts: reflections which reverse momentum completely, and transmissions in which the photon momentum “decreases” by a factor 1/n (thus transferring the “difference” to the water).\n\nLet us now plug in the numbers. For I = 1000 W/m², n = 1.33, and from part (a) R ≈ 0.02 so that (1 – R) ≈ 0.98, and note that\n\n  1 – 1/n = 1 – 1/1.33 ≈ 1 – 0.7519 ≈ 0.2481.\n\nThus, the pressure is\n\n  P = (1000/(3×10⁸)) [2(0.02) + 0.2481×(0.98)]\n     = (1000/(3×10⁸)) [0.04 + 0.2432]\n     = (1000/(3×10⁸)) (0.2832)\n     ≈ (0.2832×1000) / (3×10⁸)\n     ≈ 283.2/3×10⁸\n     ≈ 9.44×10⁻⁷ N/m².\n\nThus the pressure that sunlight exerts on the water surface is approximately 9.4×10⁻⁷ N/m².\n\n──────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n(a) The energy reflection and transmission coefficients are\n  R = ((1 – n)/(1 + n))²  and  T = 4n/(1 + n)².\n\n(b) The radiation pressure at the water surface (with incident flux I = 1 kW/m²) is\n  P = (I/c)[2R + (1 – 1/n)(1 – R)] ≈ 9.4×10⁻⁷ N/m².\n\nWe now box the final answers in the requested LaTeX format:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\nR &= \\left(\\frac{1-n}{1+n}\\right)^2,\\quad T=\\frac{4n}{(1+n)^2}, \\quad\\text{with } n=1.33,\\\\[1mm]\nP &= \\frac{I}{c}\\Bigl[2R+(1-1/n)(1-R)\\Bigr] \\approx 9.4\\times10^{-7}\\,{\\rm N/m^2}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\nR &= \\left(\\frac{1-n}{1+n}\\right)^2,\\quad T=\\frac{4n}{(1+n)^2}, \\quad\\text{with } n=1.33,\\\\[1mm]\nP &= \\frac{I}{c}\\Bigl[2R+(1-1/n)(1-R)\\Bigr] \\approx 9.4\\times10^{-7}\\,{\\rm N/m^2}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\nR &= \\left(\\frac{1-n}{1+n}\\right)^2,\\quad T=\\frac{4n}{(1+n)^2}, \\quad\\text{with } n=1.33,\\\\[1mm]\nP &= \\frac{I}{c}\\Bigl[2R+(1-1/n)(1-R)\\Bigr] \\approx 9.4\\times10^{-7}\\,{\\rm N/m^2}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "R = 0.02, \\quad T = 0.98"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "optics/3-19", "solution": "We can understand all these everyday optical phenomena through fundamental interactions of light with matter—principally scattering, refraction, reflection, and dispersion. Let’s break down each one step by step.\n\n(a) The Blue Sky  \n• Sunlight consists of all colors (wavelengths).  \n• When sunlight enters Earth’s atmosphere, it interacts with air molecules (which are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light).  \n• Rayleigh scattering comes into play, and its efficiency is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength (∝ 1/λ⁴).  \n• Shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered much more effectively than longer wavelengths (red).  \n• Although violet is scattered even more than blue, our eyes are more sensitive to blue and some violet is absorbed, so the sky appears predominantly blue.\n\n(b) The Red Sun at Sunset  \n• During sunset (or sunrise), the sun’s light must pass through a longer column of the Earth’s atmosphere compared to when it is overhead.  \n• With the increased path length, the shorter wavelengths (blue and green) are scattered out of the line of sight due to Rayleigh scattering.  \n• This leaves the longer wavelengths (red, orange, and yellow) to dominate the light that reaches the observer, making the sun and the surrounding sky appear red.\n\n(c) The Rainbow  \n• A rainbow is produced when sunlight interacts with water droplets in the atmosphere.  \n• As sunlight enters a water droplet, it is refracted (bent) because of the change in the speed of light between air and water.  \n• Inside the droplet, light hits the back surface and is partially reflected.  \n• On exiting the droplet, the light is refracted again.  \n• This double refraction (and internal reflection) splits the light into its component colors (dispersion), with each color emerging at a specific angle.  \n• The result is the arc of a rainbow that we see with its spectrum of colors.\n\n(e) The Twinkling of Stars  \n• Stars appear to twinkle (a phenomenon called scintillation) because their light passes through many layers of Earth’s turbulent atmosphere.  \n• The atmosphere is continually in motion due to temperature differences, causing fluctuating air densities and refractive indices along the light’s path.  \n• These rapid, small-scale variations cause the starlight’s apparent position and brightness to change over time.  \n• Since the effect is more pronounced for point sources (like stars) than extended objects (like the Moon), stars twinkle noticeably.\n\nThus, the underlying principles in these phenomena are Rayleigh scattering (for the blue sky and red sunset), refraction and dispersion (for rainbows), and atmospheric turbulence (for the twinkling of stars).\n\n\\[

{"id": "optics/3-29", "solution": "We can “design by hand” optical instruments whose behavior is determined by conservation of brightness (étendue), wave interference, and basic polarization conversion. One acceptable answer is described below.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (a): Converting a 10 cm Diameter, 1000 Candle-power Source into a 10^6 Beam Candle-power Searchlight\n\nPhysical principles involved: conservation of étendue (or brightness), geometrical optics (lens/mirror imaging) and collimation.\n\nDescription:  \n• Imagine you have a 10 cm diameter spherical (or “extended”) light source that radiates with a brightness corresponding to 1000 candle-power. Because of the conservation of brightness (radiance), no optical system that is loss free (neglecting absorption) can increase the brightness of an extended source; it can only “repackage” it by reducing its angular spread.  \n• A common arrangement is to use a parabolic mirror (or an appropriate lens system) which is designed so that light emerging from the source is collimated. In such a “searchlight” configuration the source is placed at the focal point of the parabolic reflector so that the rays after reflection are nearly parallel.  \n• By “collimating” the light the optical system concentrates the total flux (lumens) into a narrow solid angle. Even though the radiance (brightness) is not increased, the candle-power that is delivered to a target (i.e. “beam candlepower”) is increased because the light is “packed” into a beam of small divergence. In our case, by proper beam shaping and choosing the geometry of the collector you can concentrate the total output from 1000 cp into a narrow beam whose total candle-power is about 10^6.\n  \nThus, the arrangement consists of a large-diameter collector (mirror or lens) which “gathers” nearly all of the light from the source and “reimages” it in a collimated beam. A secondary optical system (perhaps additional lenses or reflectors) then adjusts the diameter and divergence such that the integrated beam candle-power is increased from 10^3 to 10^6.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (b): Instrument for Producing and Analyzing Circularly-Polarized Light\n\nPhysical principles involved: polarization optics, phase retardation, interference.\n\nDescription:  \n• To produce circularly-polarized light from monochromatic light, one first “linearizes” the light by passing it through a linear polarizer. This selects a given polarization axis.  \n• Then, the light is passed through a quarter-wave plate. A quarter-wave plate is a birefringent medium that introduces a phase shift of 90° between two orthogonal polarization components. If the linear polarization is oriented at ±45° with respect to the fast and slow axes of the wave plate, then the output becomes circularly polarized.  \n• For analyzing circular polarization, the procedure is reversed. The light (which may be an arbitrary mixture of right‐ and left-circular polarization) first is passed through a quarter-wave plate, now oriented so that circularly-polarized components are converted into orthogonal linear polarization states. Finally, a linear polarizer “analyzes” the light by transmitting one of the linear states, thus allowing the measurement of the relative intensities of the two circularly-polarized components.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (c): System for Estimating the Size of a Distant (Stellar) Source\n\nPhysical principles involved: interference (fringe visibility), coherence, and the Van Cittert–Zernike theorem.\n\nDescription:  \n• The size (or angular diameter) of a distant stellar source can be measured using interferometry. One can set up two (or more) telescopes separated by a variable baseline so that light collected at these separated apertures interferes.  \n• As the baseline is varied, the visibility (contrast) of the interference fringes changes. For an unresolved (point) source, the fringes have high contrast (visibility close to unity). For an extended source, the fringe visibility is reduced and eventually washed out when the baseline exceeds a certain critical value.  \n• Using the Van Cittert–Zernike theorem, the fringe visibility (the Fourier transform of the source brightness distribution) reveals the source’s spatial coherence. By measuring the reduction in fringe contrast with increasing baseline, one can deduce the angular size of the source.\n• In the optical range, Michelson stellar interferometers have been used precisely for this purpose; similarly, in the radio-frequency range, astronomical radio interferometers (e.g. Very Long Baseline Interferometry) perform analogous measurements.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\textbf{(a)}\\; \\text{A 10 cm diameter 1000 cp source is “imaged” by a suitable large-aperture reflector or lens system (e.g., a parabolic reflector) that collimates the light, concentrating its total flux into a narrow beam.

{"id": "optics/3-11", "solution": "We start by addressing each part step by step.\n\n(a)(i) Doppler Line Width\n\n• The Doppler line width refers to the broadening of an atomic or molecular spectral line that arises from the thermal motion of the atoms or molecules.  \n• Because the particles are moving with a range of velocities (typically following a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution), the frequency of the light they absorb or emit gets shifted (by the Doppler effect) depending on their velocity component along the line-of-sight.  \n• In effect, even when the intrinsic (or “natural”) transition has a single frequency, the observed spectral line is “smeared out” or broadened over a range of frequencies corresponding to the range of Doppler shifts.  \n• The width is typically characterized by a Gaussian profile, the standard deviation of which is proportional to (v/c), where v is the thermal velocity spread.\n\n(a)(ii) Natural Line Width\n\n• The natural line width is the intrinsic broadening of a spectral line due solely to the finite lifetime of the excited state involved in the transition.  \n• According to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (∆E∙∆t ≥ ħ/2), a state with a finite lifetime (∆t) cannot have a perfectly defined energy (∆E), hence the transition will have an inherent energy uncertainty translating into a frequency (or wavelength) spread.  \n• This type of broadening is independent of external factors like collisions or the Doppler effect and is often described by a Lorentzian line shape.  \n• It sets a lower bound on the line width: even if all other broadening mechanisms could be eliminated, the transition could not be measured with a precision better than that set by its natural line width.\n\n(b) Doppler Free Measurements: Saturated Absorption Spectroscopy Experiment\n\n• One commonly used technique to eliminate the Doppler broadening is saturated absorption spectroscopy (also known as Doppler-free spectroscopy).  \n• In this experiment, a narrow-bandwidth laser beam is split into two parts: a strong “pump” beam and a weak “probe” beam, which are sent in opposite directions (counter-propagating) through a vapor cell containing the atoms or molecules under study.  \n• Atoms moving with a certain velocity will see the frequencies of the two beams Doppler-shifted by equal and opposite amounts.  \n  - For most atoms, the Doppler shifts move the pump and probe beams out of resonance relative to each other, and so the absorption of the probe beam is essentially the Doppler-broadened background.\n  - However, only atoms with nearly zero velocity along the beam axis see both the pump and probe beams at the same (unshifted) frequency.\n• When the pump beam saturates the transition for these zero-velocity atoms, it depletes the ground state population at the resonant frequency, meaning that the probe beam experiences a reduced absorption at that frequency.  \n• This reduction in absorption appears as a very narrow “dip” (known as a Lamb dip) within the much broader Doppler-broadened absorption profile.  \n• By scanning the laser frequency and recording the probe absorption, one obtains the central frequency of the transition free of Doppler broadening, thereby revealing the natural line width and other intrinsic spectral features.\n\nFinal

{"id": "optics/3-27", "solution": "We can compare the “visible‐watt” to “input‐watt” efficiency for different light sources by roughly estimating the fraction of the electrical energy that appears as useful light (in the visible spectrum).\n\nOne helpful way to “back‐of‐the‐envelope” estimate the efficiency is to consider the nature of the emission mechanism and the spectral distribution of the radiation.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Incandescent Bulb\n\nAn incandescent bulb works by heating a tungsten filament to temperatures around 2800–3000 K so that it radiates as a roughly blackbody source. For a blackbody at these temperatures the spectral power distribution is broad with most of the energy released in the infrared and only a small percent in the visible portion (roughly 400–700 nm). Detailed calculations (or looking up the spectral fraction for a blackbody at ~2800 K) show that only about 2–5% of the radiant energy is in the visible band. Since nearly all the input electrical energy is eventually converted into electromagnetic radiation, the efficiency defined as (visible watts)/(input watts) is limited to roughly the same percentage. A typical value often quoted is around 2–3%.\n\nStep-by‐step summary:\n • Heated tungsten → blackbody radiation.\n • At ~2800–3000 K, about 2–5% of energy emerges in the 400–700 nm range.\n • Thus, about 0.02–0.03 watts of visible light per 1 watt input.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Light Emitting Diode (LED)\n\nIn a light emitting diode, the recombination of electrons and holes in a semiconductor emits photons in a narrow wavelength range (or, in white LEDs, a combination of wavelengths produced by a blue LED with phosphor conversion). Modern white LEDs can achieve high “wall‐plug” efficiencies (electrical‐to‐optical) in the visible region. Typically, commercial white LEDs achieve efficiencies on the order of 20% (with some state‐of‐the‐art devices approaching or even exceeding 30%). This means that for each input watt of electrical power, roughly 0.20 watt (or sometimes more) is emitted as visible light.\n\nStep-by‐step summary:\n • LED converts electrical energy directly into visible light by electron–hole recombination.\n • Modern white LEDs often reach about 20% efficiency (0.20 visible watt per 1 watt electrical input).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal answers:\n\nFor an incandescent bulb the efficiency is roughly 2–3%, and for a modern LED it is approximately 20%.\n\nIn boxed LaTeX notation the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Incandescent bulb: } \\sim 2\\%-3\\% \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\text{LED: } \\sim 20\\%}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Incandescent bulb: } \\sim 2\\%-3\\% \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\text{LED: } \\sim 20\\%"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Incandescent bulb: } \\sim 2\\%-3\\% \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\text{LED: } \\sim 20\\%", "expr2": "0.02"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Incandescent bulb: } \\sim 2\\%-3\\% \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\text{LED: } \\sim 20\\%", "expr2": "0.09"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "optics/3-18", "solution": "We must consider the dominant molecular transitions and interaction processes that occur in Earth’s atmosphere for each electromagnetic (EM) frequency range. In each case, the degree of “transparency” depends on whether the atmospheric constituents (molecules like O₂, N₂, CO₂, O₃, H₂O, etc.) have resonances or if the photons interact through other mechanisms (such as scattering or the photoelectric effect). Let’s examine each region step by step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(a) 10⁸–10⁹ Hz\n\n• This frequency range corresponds to radio‐waves in the Very High Frequency (VHF) to Ultra High Frequency (UHF) range (roughly 100 MHz to 1 GHz).\n\n• Most common atmospheric molecules do not have resonant absorption lines at these low frequencies. There are no strong rotational transitions here (most molecular rotational transitions occur in the tens of GHz and above).\n\n• Thus, aside from weak absorption by atmospheric constituents and some ionospheric effects at the lower end, the atmosphere is generally transparent in this region.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(b) Far Infra‐red\n\n• Far infrared (IR) is where many rotational transitions of molecules (especially water vapor and CO₂) lie. These are the low-energy rotational excitations.\n\n• Water vapor (H₂O) in particular has a rich rotational spectrum and is a very effective absorber in the far IR, and to some extent so are CO₂ and O₃.\n\n• Therefore, the far IR is strongly absorbed by the atmosphere, which is why many far-IR astronomical observations are made from space.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(c) Near Infra‐red\n\n• In the near IR (approximately 0.7–1.5 μm), absorption is less pronounced than in the far IR but is not completely absent. One finds vibrational overtone bands (for example, from H₂O, CO₂, and even O₂) that can absorb at specific narrow wavelengths.\n\n• In between these absorption features, the “windows” are relatively transparent — hence many astronomical near-IR observations from the ground are possible (after accounting for telluric absorption).\n\n• Thus, the near IR is “reasonably transparent” in parts (with significant absorption in narrow bands).\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(d) Visible\n\n• The atmosphere is very transparent in the visible region because none of the major constituents have strong electronic transitions that absorb visible light (except for minor effects like the well‐known ozone absorption near the ultraviolet end).\n\n• However, Rayleigh scattering by air molecules (especially N₂ and O₂) does play a role – it is responsible for the blue color of the sky. But scattering is not the same as absorption.\n\n• Thus, the visible region is highly transparent to direct transmission of light.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(e) Ultra‐violet\n\n• In the ultraviolet (UV) region the situation changes dramatically. Molecular oxygen (O₂) and ozone (O₃) have strong electronic absorption bands at UV wavelengths.\n\n• Ozone absorbs strongly in the Hartley (~200–300 nm) and Huggins bands, shielding Earth’s surface from the more deleterious shorter‐wavelength (UV-B and UV-C) radiation.\n\n• Thus, the atmosphere is strongly absorbing in the UV due to the presence of ozone (and to a lesser extent, O₂).\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(f) X‐rays\n\n• X-rays interact with matter primarily through the photoelectric effect (and to some extent Compton scattering at higher energies). The inner-shell electrons of atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, and others in the atmosphere absorb X-rays very efficiently.\n\n• The atmosphere is effectively opaque to X-rays – this is why X-ray astronomy requires space-based observatories.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(g) Gamma‐rays\n\n• Gamma-rays, at even higher energies, are attenuated by the combined effects of the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and especially pair production (when the gamma-ray energy is high enough).\n\n• The atmosphere is strongly absorbing (or “shielding”) for gamma-rays, which is why gamma-ray astronomy must be conducted from space, and the Earth’s atmosphere offers protection from cosmic gamma radiation.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers Summary\n\n• (a) 10⁸–10⁹ Hz: Atmosphere is reasonably transparent; absorption is minimal.\n\n• (b) Far infra‐red: Strongly absorbing (primarily by rotational transitions of H₂O, CO₂, etc.).\n\n• (c) Near infra‐red: Partially transparent, with absorption in narrow bands from vibrational transitions (notably water vapor and CO₂).\n\n• (d) Visible: Highly transparent (except for Rayleigh scattering, which does not remove energy but only redirects it).\n\n• (e) Ultra‐violet: Strongly absorbing (dominated by ozone and O₂ absorption).\n\n• (f) X‐rays: Strongly absorbing (dominated by the photoelectric effect in atmospheric atoms).\n\n• (g) Gamma‐rays: Strongly absorbing (through photoelectric absorption, Compton scattering, and pair production).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Boxed Format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n\\text{(a)} & \\text{Reasonably transparent (minimal absorption in VHF/UHF regime).} \\\\\n\\text{(b)} & \\text{Strongly absorbing;

Image formed by the objective\n\nFor any thin lens we use the lens formula:  \n  1/p + 1/q = 1/f  \nfor an object at distance p and an image at distance q from the lens.\n\nFor the objective, let the object distance be p₁ and the image distance be q₁. Thus we have:  \n\n  1/p₁ + 1/q₁ = 1/fₒ    (1)\n\nSince the eyepiece is to produce a final image at infinity, its object must be located at its focal plane.

Condition on the eyepiece\n\nThe eyepiece (with focal length fₑ) must have its object placed at a distance equal to fₑ. In the microscope the distance between the lenses is L. If we call the distance of the intermediate image from the objective q₁, then its distance from the eyepiece is L – q₁.

Find the object distance for the objective (p₁)\n\nSubstitute q₁ = 20 cm and fₒ = 0.5 cm into equation (1):\n\n  1/p₁ + 1/20 = 1/0.5 = 2 cm⁻¹\n\nSo,  \n  1/p₁ = 2 – (1/20) = 2 – 0.05 = 1.95 cm⁻¹\n\nThus,  \n  p₁ = 1/1.95 ≈ 0.5128 cm\n\nRounded to within 10% accuracy we have:  \n  p₁ ≈ 0.51 cm\n\n───────────────────────────────  \nStep 4.

Choosing a Suitable Wavelength\n\nA convenient choice in the visible is λ = 550 nm (chosen roughly in the center of the visible spectrum). Thus, the required thickness is\n\n  d = 550 nm/(4×2.5) = 550 nm/10 = 55 nm.\n\nSince 1 micron (μm) = 1000 nm, we have\n\n  d = 55 nm = 0.055 μm.\n\nStep 2. Calculating the Reflectivity\n\nWhen light is incident from air (n = 1) onto the film (n = 2.5) on glass (n = 1.5), there are two main reflections:\n\n1. At the air/TiO₂ interface, the amplitude reflection coefficient is given by\n\n  r₁ = (n_f - n_air)/(n_f + n_air) = (2.5 − 1)/(2.5 + 1) = 1.5/3.5 ≈ 0.4286.\n  Since the light goes from a lower to a higher index, this reflection comes with a phase shift of π (i.e. a sign change).\n\n2. At the TiO₂/glass interface, the coefficient is\n\n  r₂ = (n_substrate - n_f)/(n_substrate + n_f) = (1.5 − 2.5)/(1.5 + 2.5) = (−1)/(4) = −0.25.\n  Here, because light is going from a higher index (film) to a lower index (glass), there is no inherent phase change upon reflection.\n\nHowever, the light that reflects off the second interface must travel twice through the film. By choosing d = λ/(4n_f), the extra round‐trip phase is\n\n  Δϕ = 2π(2d n_f/λ) = 2π(2(λ/(4n_f)) n_f/λ) = 2π(1/2) = π.\n\nThus, the reflection from the second interface effectively acquires an extra phase change of π. This makes the phase of r₂ effectively match that of r₁. The two reflected waves are then in phase and add constructively.\n\nThe total reflection amplitude is\n\n  r_total = r₁ + (–r₂ with extra π, i.e. +0.25) = 0.4286 + 0.25 = 0.6786.\n\nThus, the reflected intensity (reflectivity) is given by\n\n  R = |r_total|² ≈ (0.6786)² ≈ 0.46  (or 46%).\n\nStep 3. Final Answer\n\nTo increase the reflection in the visible using a TiO₂ film on glass, one may choose λ = 550 nm and thus require a film thickness of about 55 nm (0.055 microns), which gives a reflectivity of roughly 46%.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{d\\approx0.055\\,\\mu\\text{m} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad R\\approx46\\%}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["d\\approx0.055\\,\\mu\\text{m} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad R\\approx46\\%"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "d\\approx0.055\\,\\mu\\text{m} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad R\\approx46\\%", "expr2": "d = 0.055 \\, \\mu m"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "d\\approx0.055\\,\\mu\\text{m} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad R\\approx46\\%", "expr2": "R_{\\lambda_0} = 0.376"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

In our problem a monochromatic plane wave (wavelength λ) is incident normally on a screen that has a circular hole of radius R. Because of diffraction, even on the axis behind the aperture the light field results from the interference of contributions from different parts of the hole. In fact, as z increases, the contributions from different annular zones acquire different phases and may cancel each other so that the intensity (which is proportional to the square of the field amplitude) goes to zero at certain distances.\n\nWe will use the Fresnel diffraction approximation. For an observation point on the axis (x = 0, y = 0, z > 0) the amplitude is proportional to an integral over the aperture:\n  E(z) ∝ ∫[aperture] exp(iϕ(r)) dA,\nwhere the phase from a point at radial coordinate r (in the aperture plane) is given (in the Fresnel approximation) by\n  ϕ(r) = πr²/(λz).\n\nBecause the aperture is circular, it is best to use polar coordinates (r, θ). Then\n  E(z) ∝ ∫₀^(2π)dθ ∫₀^(R) r dr exp[iπr²/(λz)].\nThe angular integration is trivial and gives a factor 2π. Thus,\n  E(z) ∝ 2π ∫₀^(R) r dr exp[iπr²/(λz)].\n\nWe now perform the substitution:\n  θ = πr²/(λz), so that dθ = (2πr/(λz)) dr ⇒ dr = (λz/(2πr)) dθ.\nThen the radial integral becomes\n  ∫₀^(R) r exp(iθ) (λz/(2πr)) dθ = (λz/(2π)) ∫₀^(θ_R) exp(iθ) dθ,\nwhere the upper limit is\n  θ_R = πR²/(λz).\n\nThus the amplitude is (up to the overall constant):\n  E(z) ∝ (λz/(2π)) [exp(iθ_R) − 1] = (λz/(2π)) [exp(iπR²/(λz)) − 1].\n\nSince the intensity is proportional to |E(z)|², the intensity on the axis is\n  I(z) ∝ |exp(iπR²/(λz)) − 1|².\n\nRecall that\n  |exp(iα) − 1|² = 4 sin²(α/2).\nThus, with α = πR²/(λz), we have\n  I(z) ∝ 4 sin²(πR²/(2λz)).\n\nThe on‐axis intensity will vanish provided that the sine term is zero.

{"id": "optics/2-11", "solution": "We begin by noting that a thin soap film (of index n) in air has two reflections: one at the top (air-to-film) and one at the bottom (film-to-air). The reflection at the top undergoes a π phase shift (i.e. a half‐wavelength phase difference) because light is reflected from a medium of lower index (air, n ≈ 1) to a higher index (soap film, n = 1.33). The reflection from the bottom, however, does not undergo a phase change (since it goes from n = 1.33 to n = 1). Thus the net phase change (apart from the extra path length) is equivalent to an extra half-wavelength shift.\n\nThe interference condition for constructive interference in the reflected light is then obtained from the optical path difference in the film combined with the additional phase shift. For a film of thickness d and an internal angle r′, the extra path traveled inside the film is 2nd cos r′. Including the half-wavelength shift, the condition for a bright fringe is\n\n  2 n d cos r′ = (m + ½) λ  ,   (m = integer)\n\nIn this problem the “constructive second order interference” is specified. In many texts the lowest bright fringe (when d is not zero) occurs for m = 1 (since m = 0 would produce a destructive interference because of the half-wavelength shift). Thus, the “second order” usually corresponds to m = 2. (One should check context, but here we take m = 2.)\n\nStep 1. Write the interference condition for m = 2:\n\n  2 n d cos r′ = (2 + ½) λ = (5/2) λ\n\nSo, solving for d:\n\n  d = (5 λ) / (4 n cos r′)\n\nStep 2. Find the refraction angle r′ inside the film.

For a point at a distance r from the center of the aperture, the extra path length relative to the center is given by\n\n  Δ = √(z² + r²) − z\n\nwhere z is the distance from the aperture to the observation point.

{"id": "optics/1-38", "solution": "We start by recalling that the brightness (or radiance) S of a diffuse source is defined as the optical energy emitted per unit area per unit solid angle per second. An ideal optical system (such as a thin lens) is subject to the conservation law known as the conservation of etendue (or Lagrange’s invariant), which essentially says that the product of the area of a beam and the solid angle it subtends is conserved (in the absence of absorption or scattering).\n\nLet’s go step by step.\n\n──────────────────────────\nStep (a): Energy Entering the Telescope\n\nThe source emits S units of energy per unit area per unit solid angle per second. The telescope subtends a solid angle Ω (that is, it “accepts” light coming from a solid angle Ω). The objective lens of the telescope has an area A. Thus, the total energy per second intercepted by the telescope is obtained by integrating over the area A and the accepted solid angle Ω. That is,\n\n  Energy per second = (Energy per unit area per unit solid angle per second) × (Area) × (Solid angle)\n  => E = S · A · Ω\n\nThus, the energy entering the telescope per second is SΩA.\n\n──────────────────────────\nStep (b): Conservation of Etendue – Image Area Times Solid Angle\n\nWhen the objective lens forms an image of the source, the rays from the source are re-directed so that in the image plane they occupy some area A_image and, viewed from the image, the objective lens appears to subtend some solid angle Ω_image. The conservation of etendue (or optical invariant) tells us that\n\n  A_image × Ω_image = A × Ω\n\nIn other words, the product of the area of the optical element (or the beam cross-sectional area) and the solid angle it subtends remains invariant throughout the optical system. In our problem it is stated that the area of the image produced by the lens times the solid angle subtended by the objective lens at the image equals ΩA.\n\n──────────────────────────\nStep (c): No Increase in Apparent Brightness\n\nThe apparent brightness (or radiance) of an object is defined as the energy per unit area per unit solid angle. In our optical system, while the lens resizes the image (thereby potentially modifying both the area and the solid angle subtended by the image), the conservation law shows that the product A_image · Ω_image remains equal to the original ΩA from the object’s side. Essentially, the lens “rearranges” the light so that even though the image might be larger or smaller than the object in one respect, the energy per unit area per unit solid angle remains exactly as defined by S.\n\nThus, even after the lens has formed an image, the brightness remains S. This is a statement of the conservation of radiance: an ideal optical system (here modeled by a thin lens) cannot increase the inherent brightness of a diffuse source.

The Two Parts of the Pattern\n\n(a) Interference:\nIf the slits were “infinitely narrow”, the intensity on the screen would be given by the usual two‐slit interference formula. With the lens, the angular coordinate θ on the screen (measured from the optical axis) is related to a linear coordinate x by x = f tan θ ≈ fθ (for small angles).

Notice that the broad diffraction envelope (with its first minima at sin θ = ±λ/a) modulates the many closely spaced interference fringes. Since d/a = 5, the central diffraction maximum (extending between sin θ = ±λ/a) will contain many interference fringes.

The bright interference fringes vary in height according to the slowly varying sinc² envelope.

Determining the Image Size\n\nThe sun, as seen from Earth, subtends an angle of about θₛ = 0.01 radians (in diameter). For a thin lens with focal length f, the diameter d of the sun’s image formed on the sheet is given (for small angles) by\n\n  d ≈ f × θₛ.\n\nThus, the radius of the image is\n\n  r_img ≈ (f × θₛ) / 2.\n\nThe area of the image is then\n\n  A_img = π (r_img)² = π (f θₛ/2)² = π f² θₛ²/4.\n\nStep 2.

{"id": "optics/2-26", "solution": "We will answer step‐by‐step.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (a): Distinguish between Fraunhofer and Fresnel Diffractions\n\n• Fraunhofer diffraction is called “far‐field diffraction” because it is observed when the source and the screen (or observation plane) are at sufficiently large distances (or equivalently when lenses are used to produce plane wavefronts and to record the Fourier transform of the aperture). In this case the wavefronts impinging on the diffracting aperture may be taken as plane waves and the diffracted light is essentially the angular spectrum (or Fourier transform) of the aperture. The mathematical treatment is simpler and the pattern is “scale–invariant” in the sense that its shape does not change with distance (only its size scales).\n\n• In contrast, Fresnel diffraction is “near‐field diffraction”. It occurs when either the source, the aperture, or the screen (observation plane) are at finite (i.e. not very large) distances. In this case, the curvature of the wavefront has to be taken into account and the resulting diffraction pattern depends on the distances involved. The mathematics usually involves the Fresnel integrals and a quadratic phase factor appears. \n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (b): Schematic Experimental Arrangement for Observing Fraunhofer Diffraction\n\nA typical arrangement is as follows:\n\n1. A point or extended light source is placed.\n2. A collimating lens is used to convert the diverging light from the source into a parallel beam.\n3. The collimated beam illuminates the diffracting aperture (single slit, double slit, etc.).\n4. A second lens is used to collect the diffracted light and form an image of the far–field (i.e. the Fourier transform of the aperture) on a screen placed at its focal plane.\n\nA schematic diagram (in words) would be:\n\n     Light Source ─► Collimating Lens ─► Aperture (slit(s)) ─► Fourier Transform Lens ─► Screen\n\nThis arrangement ensures that both the incident beam and the observation plane effectively lie at “infinity” so that the Fraunhofer conditions are met.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (c): Drawings and Descriptions of the Patterns\n\n1. Single Slit:\n   - The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a single slit of width a consists of a central maximum which is the brightest and widest. On either side, there are subsidiary (secondary) maxima and deeper minima.\n   - The minima occur at the angles θ given by: \n     \n     sinθ = mλ/a   (m = ±1, ±2, …)\n     \n     The pattern will look like a broad central bright band with a series of decreasing bright bands on each side separated by dark zones.\n\n2. Double Slit:\n   - For two slits (each of width a and separated by a distance d), the pattern is a superposition of a single–slit diffraction envelope and a fine interference pattern.\n   - The envelope is essentially the same as that from a single slit, but within this envelope, there are many sharp bright and dark interference fringes. The interference condition is:\n   \n     d sinθ = mλ   (m = 0, ±1, ±2, …)\n     \n   - Thus, the distinguishing feature is that the double–slit pattern shows a rapid oscillation of fringes (due to the interference between the two coherent beams) modulated by the smoother single–slit diffraction envelope.\n\nA rough sketch (not drawn to scale) would show:\n\n     For Single Slit:                         \n     \n          |         *\n          |       *   *\n          |      *     *\n          |-----*-------*----- (bright central band)\n          |      *     *\n          |       *   *\n          |         *\n     \n     For Double Slit:\n     \n          |          *  *  *  *  *  *    ← interference fringes\n          |       *  *  *  *  *  *  * \n          |-----*--*--*--*--*--*--*-----   (interference fringes) \n          |       *  *  *  *  *  *  *\n          |          *  *  *  *  *  *\n     \n     (Note: In the double–slit diagram the “fine” fringes (bright and dark lines) lie inside the overall envelope that has the wider single–slit diffraction shape.)\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (d): Interference Pattern with Three Equally Spaced Slits\n\nLet us derive the pattern for three slits.\n\nAssume the slits are equally spaced with center–to–center distance d. When a plane wave of wavelength λ illuminates the slits, the wave from each slit will have a phase difference δ relative to its adjacent slit given by\n\n  δ = (2π/λ) d sinθ.\n\nThe contributions from the three slits (all assumed to have the same amplitude E₀) can be written as:\n  E = E₀ + E₀ e^(iδ) + E₀ e^(i2δ).\n\nThis is a finite geometric series with three terms. The sum is\n  E = E₀ (1 + e^(iδ) + e^(i2δ))\n    = E₀ [ (1 − e^(i3δ))/(1 − e^(iδ)) ], for e^(iδ) ≠ 1.\n\nThe intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude:\n  I(θ) ∝ |E|² = E₀² | (1 − e^(i3δ))/(1 − e^(iδ)) |².\n\nUsing the standard formula for the modulus of a geometric series term, one obtains\n  |1 − e^(iNδ)| = 2 |sin(Nδ/2)|.\nThus, for N = 3,\n  |1 − e^(i3δ)| = 2 |sin(3δ/2)|, and similarly,\n  |1 − e^(iδ)| = 2 |sin(δ/2)|.\nHence,\n  I(θ) ∝ E₀² [sin(3δ/2)/sin(δ/2)]².\n\nTo write this in a familiar form, one can let I₀ be the maximum intensity so that\n\n  I(θ) = I₀ [ sin( (3π d sinθ)/λ ) / sin( (π d sinθ)/λ ) ]².\n\nThis is the interference pattern for three equally spaced slits. Notice that it has much narrower and more intense principal maxima than the two-slit case, and additional, lesser maxima occur between the principal ones (so-called “secondary maxima”).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers in Summary\n\n(a) Fraunhofer diffraction is observed when both source and screen can be considered at infinity (or when lenses produce plane‐wavefront illumination and transform the aperture’s Fourier spectrum onto a screen), while in Fresnel diffraction the source and screen are at finite distances so that the curvature of the wavefront must be taken into account.\n\n(b) An experimental arrangement for observing Fraunhofer diffraction consists of a light source, a collimating lens (to produce plane waves), an aperture (or slit), and a second lens that focuses the diffracted light onto a screen located at its focal plane. That is: \n  Light Source → Collimating Lens → Aperture → Fourier Transform (Focusing) Lens → Screen.\n\n(c) For a single slit of width a, the Fraunhofer pattern has a central maximum (bright and wide) with successive minima at sinθ = ±mλ/a (m = 1, 2, …) and fainter side lobes. For a double slit, the overall envelope is that of the single–slit diffraction but it is “decorated” with rapidly alternating interference fringes whose spacing is given by d sinθ = mλ (m = 0, ±1, …). Thus, the double-slit pattern shows fine fringes within the broad diffraction envelope.\n\n(d) For three equally spaced slits (with spacing d) the resultant amplitude is given by\n  E = E₀ (1 + e^(iδ) + e^(i2δ)),  where δ = (2π/λ)d sinθ.\nThis gives an intensity pattern\n  I(θ) = I₀ [sin(3δ/2)/sin(δ/2)]²  or equivalently  \n  I(θ) = I₀ [ sin( (3π d sinθ)/λ ) / sin( (π d sinθ)/λ ) ]².\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\text{Fraunhofer diffraction is observed when both the source and the screen are placed so that the incident wavefronts are effectively planar (or lenses are used to produce plane waves and record the Fourier transform of the aperture).

{"id": "optics/2-19", "solution": "Below is one acceptable answer with explanation of how to check both the surface flatness and the mutual parallelism of the faces, followed by the final answer.\n\nStep 1. Measuring Surface Flatness\n\n• Because the claim is that each face is “flat to within 1/4 wave” (i.e. deviations of the order of 546 nm/4 ≈ 137 nm), a standard method is to use an interferometric test. In practice, one uses a Fizeau interferometer (or a similar interferometric setup) with a high‐quality reference flat and a collimated (monochromatic) beam of mercury‐green light (λ = 546 nm).\n\n• In this test the window is placed so that one surface is in contact (or nearly so) with the reference flat. The reflection from the test surface interferes with that from the reference flat and produces an interference pattern (fringe pattern). A “perfectly flat” surface would give rise to straight, evenly spaced fringes (or ideally a uniform field, depending on the exact configuration).\n\n• By counting how many fringes appear and/or by measuring the fringe deviation, you can determine the optical path difference (OPD) error on the surface. Since a 1/4‐wave crest difference is 137 nm in this case, if the interference pattern indicates errors less than that value then the surface flatness specification is verified.\n\nStep 2. Measuring the Parallelism of the Two Surfaces\n\n• The window also has the specification that the pair of surfaces be parallel to within 5 seconds of arc. (1 arcsec ≈ 4.85 × 10⁻⁶ radians, so 5 arcsec ≈ 2.43 × 10⁻⁵ radians.) With a thickness of 5 mm, a misalignment of 2.43 × 10⁻⁵ radians would correspond to a difference in thickness (or wedge) over the full aperture given roughly by:\n  Δt ≈ t × (wedge angle) ≈ 5 × 10⁻³ m × 2.43 × 10⁻⁵ ≈ 1.215 × 10⁻⁷ m (≈121.5 nm).\nThis small wedge (of order 1/4 wave in optical path difference) must be resolved.\n\n• There are several ways to measure such a small wedge error. One way is to use the interferometer in double‐pass mode (or “compensator” mode) so that light reflects from both surfaces. In this configuration the interference fringes are very sensitive to the slight wedge between the two surfaces. When the window is illuminated with collimated mercury‐green light, the resulting fringe pattern will have a spacing that is directly related to the wedge angle between the surfaces. By measuring the fringe separation or counting how many fringes appear across the window you can determine if the angle difference is less than about 2.43 × 10⁻⁵ radians (i.e. 5 arcsec).\n\n• An alternative method is to use an autocollimator with a resolution of a few arcseconds. In that approach, a collimated beam is reflected from the first surface, and then the second surface, and any angular difference in the reflected beams is detected. With modern autocollimators, measuring differences of a few arcseconds is quite feasible.\n\nStep 3. Summary of the Measurement Procedure\n\n1. Use a Fizeau interferometer with a mercury‐green light source and a high-quality reference flat to test each face of the window for flatness. The interference fringe pattern should indicate that the surface deviation is less than 1/4 wave (≈137 nm).\n\n2. To verify parallelism, either:\n\n  a. use a double-pass interferometric test – observing the interference between the reflections from the two surfaces and calculating the wedge angle from the fringe spacing, or\n\n  b. use an autocollimator to directly measure the angular difference between the two surfaces’ reflected beams.\n\nEach method should be sensitive enough to detect differences on the order of 5 arcsec (≈2.43 × 10⁻⁵ radians).\n\nFinal Answer:\n\nBy using an interferometric test—specifically a Fizeau interferometer with a mercury‐green (546 nm) collimated light source and a high‐quality reference flat—you can measure the surface flatness by examining the interference fringes produced by light reflected from each face (confirming deviations of less than 1/4 wave, i.e. about 137 nm). In addition, by either using a double‐pass interferometric setup (analyzing the fringe spacing produced by reflections from both surfaces) or an autocollimator with arc‐second resolution, you can verify that the two surfaces are parallel to within 5 arcsec (≈2.43 × 10⁻⁵ radians). \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Use a Fizeau interferometer with a mercury-green source to measure each surface’s flatness (via fringe deviation corresponding to < } \\lambda/4\\text{) and either a double-pass interferometric setup or an autocollimator to measure the wedge angle (ensuring a parallelism within 5 arcsec).}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Use a Fizeau interferometer with a mercury-green source to measure each surface’s flatness (via fringe deviation corresponding to < } \\lambda/4\\text{) and either a double-pass interferometric setup or an autocollimator to measure the wedge angle (ensuring a parallelism within 5 arcsec).}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Use a Fizeau interferometer with a mercury-green source to measure each surface’s flatness (via fringe deviation corresponding to < } \\lambda/4\\text{) and either a double-pass interferometric setup or an autocollimator to measure the wedge angle (ensuring a parallelism within 5 arcsec).}", "expr2": "S \\geq 0.75 \\text{ cm}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "optics/1-37", "solution": "Step 1. (Recall the definition of brightness)  \nThe brightness (or radiance) of a source is defined as the power per unit projected area and per unit solid angle. In other words, if an object has a brightness B (in W/cm²·sr⁻¹), then a small area element dA observed within a small solid angle dΩ emits a power dΦ = B cosθ dA dΩ, where θ is the angle between the surface normal and the line of sight.\n\nStep 2. (Principle of conservation of brightness)  \nA fundamental result in optics, sometimes called Liouville’s theorem or the invariance of radiance, states that in a lossless optical system (i.e. no absorption or scattering) the brightness (or radiance) is conserved. This means that an image formed by an ideal lens retains the same brightness as the original source, regardless of magnification or reduction in area.\n\nStep 3. (Application to the sun and lens system)  \nConsider a lens of focal length f that is used to image the sun onto its focal plane. The sun, being an extended object, subtends a certain angular size (its half‐angle being approximately 0.25°). The lens collects light from all parts of the sun’s surface that are visible through its aperture and focuses them onto the focal plane. Regardless of the fact that the image size (on the focal plane) is determined by the focal length (with the radius of the image approximately fθ for small angles), every ray is focused according to the laws of geometrical optics in such a way that the radiance is preserved.\n\nStep 4. (Mathematical sketch)  \n• A small area dA_S on the sun (with brightness B_S) emits power dΦ = B_S cosθ dA_S dΩ_S.  \n• The lens collects rays from this surface element over some solid angle dΩ and forms an image element with a corresponding area dA_I.  \n• By conservation of radiance in an ideal system, we have  \n  B_I = dΦ/(dA_I cosθ' dΩ) = B_S  \nThus, the brightness of the image B_I is just equal to the brightness of the sun’s surface B_S.\n\nStep 5. (Physical interpretation)  \nEven though the lens collects light over its finite area and forms an image of a much smaller angular extent, the redistribution of light by the lens does not increase or decrease the inherent brightness of the light. The system merely changes the geometry (area and solid angle) in such a way that the power per unit area per unit solid angle remains the same as that on the sun’s surface.\n\nFinal Answer:  \nThe brightness of the image on the focal plane is nearly the same as the brightness of the sun’s surface because, in an ideal lossless optical system, the brightness (or radiance) is invariant. \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The image brightness equals the sun’s surface brightness because radiance is conserved in an ideal optical system.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{The image brightness equals the sun’s surface brightness because radiance is conserved in an ideal optical system.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{The image brightness equals the sun’s surface brightness because radiance is conserved in an ideal optical system.}", "expr2": "L \\approx L'"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "optics/2-17", "solution": "We start by considering a thin film (with refractive index n = 4/3) that is surrounded by air (n₀ = 1).

The beam that enters the film, reflects off the bottom (film–air) interface, and then exits the film.\n\nBecause of the boundary conditions for reflection at an interface, one of these faces introduces a phase change. In fact, when a light wave goes from a lower to a higher refractive index (air to film), the reflection picks up a phase change of π (i.e. a sign reversal). In our case:\n\n• Reflection at the air–film interface (n₀ = 1 → n = 4/3):  \n  Amplitude reflection coefficient r₁ = (1 – n)/(1 + n) = (1 – 4/3)/(1 + 4/3) = –1/7.\n\n• Reflection at the film–air interface (n = 4/3 → n₀ = 1):  \n  Amplitude reflection coefficient r₂ = (n – 1)/(n + 1) = (4/3 – 1)/(4/3 + 1) = 1/7.\n\nSince most of the incident light is transmitted (due to the small reflectivities), we only consider the two main reflected beams.\n\nThe beam reflected from the top surface has amplitude proportional to r₁ = –1/7. The second beam, after transmission and reflection inside the film, acquires an additional phase due to the extra optical path length. The extra distance traveled inside the film (down and then up) is 2d, so the phase difference is\n\n  δ = (2nd)·(2π/λ) = 4πnd/λ.\n\nThus, the second reflected beam has amplitude (ignoring overall transmission factors which are nearly unity) r₂ exp(iδ) = (1/7) exp(iδ).\n\nNow, when the two beams combine, the total complex amplitude of the reflected light is\n\n  r_total = –1/7 + (1/7) exp(iδ) = (1/7) [exp(iδ) – 1].\n\nThus, the intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude:\n  I_r ∝ |r_total|² = (1/49) |exp(iδ) – 1|².\n\nRecalling that\n  |exp(iδ) – 1|² = 2[1 – cosδ],\nwe have\n\n  I_r = (1/49)·2[1 – cosδ] = (2/49)[1 – cosδ].\n\nSince δ = 4πnd/λ, we can write\n\n  I_r = (2/49) [1 – cos(4πnd/λ)].\n\nThis gives the reflected intensity relative to the incident intensity I₀.

(Its sign depends on handedness, but here we are concerned with the magnitude of the transferred angular momentum.) In our problem the light is defined as right‐handed (clockwise when looking toward the oncoming beam) and the transfer of spin by the light is to be measured via the torque exerted on the slab.\n\nA key point is that when a photon is “used” in a process (whether by being absorbed, reflected, or having its polarization changed) the difference between its initial and final spin angular momentum is what must be delivered (or taken) by the medium.\n\nAlso note that 1 watt = 10⁷ erg/s and \n  c = 3×10¹⁰ cm/s,\nand the wavelength is\n  λ = 6200 Å = 6200×10^(–8) cm = 6.2×10^(–5) cm.\n\nLet’s now analyze each case step by step.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Angular momentum per second carried by the light\n\nThe energy of one photon is \n  E = ħω  with ω = 2πc/λ.\nThus the number of photons arriving per second is\n\n  n = P/(ħω) = P/[ħ(2πc/λ)] = (Pλ)/(2πcħ).\n\nWhen a photon transfers “Δ” spin angular momentum, then the total angular momentum transferred per unit time (which is a torque) is\n\n  τ = n (Δ)\n\nFor our purpose we shall define τ₀ as the torque when each photon transfers an angular momentum of ħ (that is, if the entire photon is absorbed and its spin is taken up by the slab). Then\n\n  τ₀ = nħ = (Pλ)/(2πc). \n\nPlugging in the numbers gives\n\n  τ₀ = (10⁷ erg/s × 6.2×10^(–5) cm) / (2π×3×10^(10) cm/s).\n\nLet us calculate the numerator first:\n  10⁷ × 6.2×10^(–5) = 6.2×10² erg·cm/s = 620 erg·cm/s.\n\nThe denominator is\n  2π×3×10¹⁰ ≈ 6.2832×3×10¹⁰ ≈ 1.88496×10¹¹.\n\nThus\n\n  τ₀ ≈ 620 / (1.88496×10¹¹) dyne-cm ≈ 3.29×10^(–9) dyne-cm.\n\nWe now consider the four cases.\n\n────────────────────────────\n(a) Absorbing slab\n\nIf the slab is completely absorbing all the light, each photon disappears and its spin angular momentum (with magnitude ħ) is completely transferred. Thus the torque is exactly\n\n  τ₀ = Pλ/(2πc) ≈ 3.3×10^(–9) dyne-cm.\n\n────────────────────────────\n(b) Ordinary Silvered Mirror\n\nWhen light is reflected, the polarization is reversed. (For conventional metallic mirrors an incident circularly‐polarized photon, say RCP with spin +ħ, is reflected as LCP with spin –ħ.) Hence the change per photon is\n\n  Δ = (–ħ) – (+ħ) = –2ħ   (i.e. a change in magnitude of 2ħ).\n\nThus the mirror must supply (or absorb) twice as much angular momentum per photon compared to the absorption case. Hence the torque is\n\n  τ = 2τ₀.\n\nIn units of τ₀, the answer is 2.\n\n────────────────────────────\n(c) Transparent Half‐wave Plate\n\nA half‐wave plate is designed to flip the handedness of circularly–polarized light. That is, a right‐circularly–polarized (RCP) photon (spin +ħ) becomes left‐circularly–polarized (LCP, spin –ħ) upon transmission. So each photon’s spin changes by\n\n  Δ = (–ħ) – (+ħ) = –2ħ.\n\nAgain, the magnitude of the change is 2ħ per photon. Therefore, the rate of angular momentum transferred (torque) is again\n\n  τ = 2τ₀.\n\nThus in units of τ₀ the answer is 2.\n\n────────────────────────────\n(d) Transparent Half‐wave Plate with the Top Surface Silvered\n\nNow the light undergoes a two‐step process:\n 1. It enters the half–wave plate from below. On first passage the half–wave plate flips RCP into LCP. (Angular momentum change: –2ħ per photon; the plate takes –2ħ per photon.)\n 2. The LCP light then meets the silvered (mirror) top surface and is reflected. As before, reflection flips LCP back to RCP, so the mirror gives a change Δ = [(+ħ) – (–ħ)] = +2ħ. \n 3. The RCP light then passes back down through the half–wave plate. On this second pass the half–wave plate again flips the polarization: RCP becomes LCP, contributing another –2ħ per photon.\n\nThus, the net change in the photon’s spin going from the initial RCP to the final state is\n\n  (First pass: –2ħ) + (Mirror: +2ħ) + (Second pass: –2ħ) = –2ħ.\n\nThat is, overall, each photon suffers a total change of 2ħ in magnitude (the sign indicates the direction, but here we are asked for the magnitude in terms of τ₀). Therefore, the net torque on the entire slab (half–wave plate plus mirror) is\n\n  τ = 2τ₀.\n\nIt is interesting to note that although the half–wave plate itself undergoes two passes (and so feels torques on each pass), the total angular momentum change delivered to the slab is the same as in part (b) and (c).\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The torque is\n  τ₀ = Pλ/(2πc) ≈ 3.3×10^(–9) dyne-cm.\n\n(b) For a silvered mirror, the torque is 2τ₀.\n\n(c) For a transparent half–wave plate the torque is 2τ₀.\n\n(d) For a transparent half–wave plate with the top surface silvered the torque is also 2τ₀.\n\nThus, in boxed final answer form we have:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad \\tau_0 &= \\frac{P\\lambda}{2\\pi c} \\approx 3.3\\times10^{-9}\\,{\\rm dyne\\!-\\!cm},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\tau &= 2\\,\\tau_0,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad \\tau &= 2\\,\\tau_0,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad \\tau &= 2\\,\\tau_0.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad \\tau_0 &= \\frac{P\\lambda}{2\\pi c} \\approx 3.3\\times10^{-9}\\,{\\rm dyne\\!-\\!cm},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\tau &= 2\\,\\tau_0,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad \\tau &= 2\\,\\tau_0,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad \\tau &= 2\\,\\tau_0.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad \\tau_0 &= \\frac{P\\lambda}{2\\pi c} \\approx 3.3\\times10^{-9}\\,{\\rm dyne\\!-\\!cm},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\tau &= 2\\,\\tau_0,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad \\tau &= 2\\,\\tau_0,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad \\tau &= 2\\,\\tau_0.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\tau_0 = 3.3 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{dyn. cm}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

(What is the phenomenon?)  \nThis phenomenon is called \"optical rotation\" observed in optically active media. In such crystals, the refractive indices for right- and left-circularly polarized light (n_R and n_L respectively) are slightly different. When plane-polarized light (which can be considered as a superposition of equal-amplitude right and left circularly polarized waves) enters the crystal, the two circular components propagate at different speeds. As a result, they accumulate different phases while traveling through the medium. When these two components are recombined at the exit, the net result is that the plane of polarization has rotated relative to its original orientation. This is because the relative phase shift between the two circular components determines the angle of the resultant linear polarization.\n\nStep 2. (Derivation of the rotation angle φ)  \nConsider plane-polarized light of angular frequency ω entering the material of thickness d. The plane-polarized wave may be written as a sum of right- and left-circularly polarized components. These components travel with different wave numbers:\n  k_R = (n_R ω)/c  and  k_L = (n_L ω)/c,  \nwhere c is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nOver the thickness d, the right- and left-circular components accumulate different phase shifts:\n  Phase for R: k_R d = (ω n_R d)/c,\n  Phase for L: k_L d = (ω n_L d)/c.\n\nThus, the phase difference between the two components is:\n  Δφ = k_R d − k_L d = (ω d/c)(n_R − n_L).\n\nSince the original plane-polarized light was an equal superposition of these two circular modes, the polarization rotates by half of the phase difference between them.

Find the image distance for an object at 15 m using the lens equation\n\n  1/s + 1/s′ = 1/f\n\nFor s = 15 m and f = 0.06 m:\n\n  1/s′ = 1/f − 1/s = (1/0.06) − (1/15)\n     = 16.67 m⁻¹ − 0.0667 m⁻¹ ≈ 16.60 m⁻¹\n\nSo,  s′ ≈ 1/16.60 ≈ 0.06024 m.\n\nThe sensor is therefore behind the lens at about 60.24 mm. For an object at infinity the best focus is at 60.00 mm, so the defocus error is\n\n  δ = s′ (for 15 m) − f = 0.06024 m − 0.06 m ≈ 0.00024 m.\n\nStep 2. Determine the defocus blur circle\n\nFor a lens with aperture diameter D, a simple geometric argument shows that when the sensor is mis‐positioned by an amount δ, the blur circle has a diameter approximately\n\n  d_defocus ≈ (D/f)·δ.\n\nStep 3. Determine the diffraction blur (Airy disk)\n\nFor a circular aperture the diameter of the first dark ring (first minimum) of the Airy pattern (which we take as a measure of the diffraction blur) is\n\n  d_diffraction ≈ 2.44 λ (f/D),\n\nwhere λ is a typical wavelength of visible light. (A commonly used value is λ = 550 nm = 550×10⁻⁹ m.)\n\nStep 4. Equate defocus and diffraction blur diameters\n\nWe wish to have\n\n  d_defocus = d_diffraction,\n   (D/f)·δ = 2.44 λ (f/D).\n\nSolve for D:\n  Multiply both sides by D:\n    (D²/f)·δ = 2.44 λ f,\n  So,\n    D² = (2.44 λ f²)/δ.\n\nStep 5. Insert the numerical values\n\n  f = 0.06 m,\n  δ = 0.00024 m,\n  λ = 550×10⁻⁹ m.\n\nCompute the numerator:\n  2.44 λ = 2.44 × 550×10⁻⁹ m ≈ 1.342×10⁻⁶ m,\nThen,\n  D² = (1.342×10⁻⁶ m × (0.06 m)²) / 0.00024 m.\nFirst, (0.06 m)² = 0.0036 m², so:\n  D² = (1.342×10⁻⁶ m × 0.0036 m²) / 0.00024 m\n     = (4.83×10⁻⁹ m³) / 0.00024 m\n     ≈ 2.0125×10⁻⁵ m².\n\nTaking the square root,\n  D ≈ √(2.0125×10⁻⁵ m²) ≈ 0.00449 m, i.e. about 4.5 mm.\n\nStep 6. Interpret in terms of f‐number\n\nThe f-number is given by f/D. With f = 60 mm and D ≈ 4.5 mm, we have\n\n  f/number ≈ 60 mm / 4.5 mm ≈ 13.3,\ni.e. approximately f/13.\n\nFinal Answer:\nFor the diffraction blur to be roughly equal to the defocus blur (when the lens is focused at 15 m and imaging a star at infinity), the aperture opening should be about 4.5 mm in diameter, which is approximately f/13 on a 60 mm lens.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Aperture diameter } \\approx 4.5\\,\\text{mm}\\text{ (about f/13)}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Aperture diameter } \\approx 4.5\\,\\text{mm}\\text{ (about f/13)}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Aperture diameter } \\approx 4.5\\,\\text{mm}\\text{ (about f/13)}", "expr2": "D = 0.32 \\text{ cm}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

But with the film at z = v + δ, the rays, coming from the edge of the aperture (of diameter D = f/N), form a cone that has not come to a complete focus. A simple geometric analysis (see the diagram below) shows that the diameter of the blur circle c is proportional to the extra distance δ and the size of the aperture:\n\n  c = (δ/v) · D.\n\n(Here we use the fact that, over the defocus distance, the cone’s diameter grows linearly; for small defocus errors, the relation is a good approximation.)\n\nSubstitute D = f/N:\n\n  c = (δ/v) · (f/N).\n\nWe are told that when the film is moved 10 mm behind the focus position, the blurred “width” is c = 1 mm.

{"id": "optics/2-38", "solution": "We wish to send a laser beam to the moon with an extremely small divergence – that is, with a diffraction‐limited angular width (measured from the first minimum on one side to the first minimum on the other) of 10⁻⁶ radians. One way to do this is to “expand” the beam using a telescope. The idea is to use a short–focal–length lens to produce a small beam waist that is then “blown up” by a large telescope objective (or mirror) so that the beam fills the telescope’s aperture. The output beam will then be (nearly) collimated, and its angular divergence will be dominated by diffraction through the (now large) aperture. For a diffraction–limited beam the smallest achievable divergence is roughly determined by the size of the aperture.\n\nLet’s now go step by step:\n\n1. Diffraction Limit for a Rectangular Aperture\n\nIf we suppose that the telescope’s objective has a rectangular aperture of width a, then the familiar single–slit (or rectangular aperture) diffraction formula tells us that the first minimum occurs when\n  sinθ ≈ θ ≈ λ/a   (for small angles). \nSince the pattern is symmetric the first minimum on one side is at about +θ and on the other side at −θ. Thus the full angular width (from first minimum to first minimum) is approximately \n  Δθ ≈ 2λ/a.\n\nWe want Δθ to be 10⁻⁶ rad. Thus we set\n  2λ/a = 10⁻⁶  ⇒  a = 2λ/10⁻⁶.\n\n2. Numerical Example\n\nFor a visible laser we could take, for example, λ = 500×10⁻⁹ m (500 nm). Then\n  a = (2 × 500×10⁻⁹ m) / 10⁻⁶ = (1000×10⁻⁹) / 10⁻⁶ = 1.0 m.\n\nThus the objective (or mirror) of the telescope should have an aperture of about 1 meter (in the dimension that determines the diffraction) so that the beam after expansion is diffraction–limited to a full angular width of about 10⁻⁶ radians.\n\n3. Role of the Short–Focus Lens\n\nThe laser itself typically produces a beam that is narrow but of modest diameter. To take full advantage of a 1–meter telescope, you need to “fill” its aperture with light. A short–focal–length lens is used to focus the laser beam down to a small waist. By then placing the telescope objective (or using the telescope in reverse) so that the small waist is located in its focal plane, you obtain a collimated beam whose diameter is essentially the size of the telescope’s aperture. In other words, the short–focus lens has to be chosen (with a correspondingly large numerical aperture) so that the laser beam is expanded to the size needed to uniformly illuminate the telescope aperture.\n\n4. Summary of the Required Characteristics\n\n• Telescope (or mirror) objective:\n  – Must be diffraction–limited.\n  – Must have an effective aperture (in the “width” direction) of order 1 m (for a 500 nm laser) so that\n   2λ / a ≈ 10⁻⁶ rad.\n  (For a circular aperture one would use the similar Rayleigh criterion, 1.22λ/D ≈ 10⁻⁶ rad, which for 500 nm gives D ≈ 0.61 m. The rectangular case gives a comparable answer when taking into account exactly how the “angular width” is defined.)\n\n• Short–focus lens:\n  – Must have a short enough focal length and a sufficiently large clear aperture such that the laser beam is focused to a small waist\n  – The telescope is then used (in “reverse”) to take this waist and produce a nearly collimated beam that fills a 1–m aperture, hence achieving a divergence set by the diffraction limit.\n\nThus, by using a carefully chosen short–focal–length lens to prepare the beam and a high–quality, large (≈1 m) aperture telescope objective to expand it, you obtain a beam whose full diffraction pattern (first minimum to first minimum) is about 10⁻⁶ radians. This is critical when trying to send a beam to a distant target like the moon so as to minimize spreading.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{To achieve a 10⁻⁶ rad full angular width (first minima), the beam expander must create a beam of width }a\\approx\\frac{2\\lambda}{10^{-6}}\\approx1\\text{ m (for }\\lambda\\sim500\\text{ nm).

Each of the N slits is illuminated coherently and so we may represent its electric field contribution as having equal amplitude and a phase which depends on the extra path length to a point P on the screen at an angle θ relative to the normal.\n\n2. The extra path from one slit relative to the next is\n  Δ = d sin θ.\nHence the phase difference between light from successive slits is\n\n  δ = kΔ = (2π/λ) d sin θ.\n\n3. The net field is the sum of N contributions whose phases form an arithmetic progression:\n  E(θ) = E₀ [1 + e^(iδ) + e^(i2δ) + ⋯ + e^(i(N–1)δ)],\nwhere E₀ is the field from one slit. This is a geometric series with N terms.\n\n4. Summing the series (recall that for a geometric series, 1+z+z²+…+z^(N–1) = (1–z^(N))/(1–z) for z ≠ 1) we find\n  E(θ) = E₀ (1 – e^(iNδ))/(1 – e^(iδ)).\nA little algebra (multiplying numerator and denominator by e^(–iNδ/2) and e^(–iδ/2) respectively) yields\n  E(θ) = E₀ e^(i(N–1)δ/2) [sin(Nδ/2) / sin(δ/2)].\n\n5. The intensity is proportional to the square modulus of the field. Since the overall phase factor has no effect on the intensity,\n  I(θ) ∝ |E(θ)|² = I₀ [sin(Nδ/2) / sin(δ/2)]²,\nwith I₀ (the single-slit intensity) setting the overall constant.\n\n6. Writing the answer explicitly in terms of the parameters we defined,\n  δ = (2π/λ)d sinθ,\nso that the final angular intensity distribution is\n\n  I(θ) = I(0) [sin((Nπd sinθ)/λ) / sin((πd sinθ)/λ)]².\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Resolving Power Using the Rayleigh Criterion\n\n1. The condition for the principal (central) maximum in interference is that the contributions from all slits add in phase. This gives the grating equation:\n  d sinθ = mλ    for m = 0, ±1, ±2, … \nwhere m is the order of the diffraction maximum.\n\n2. Now consider two close wavelengths λ and λ + Δλ that both satisfy the grating equation nearly at the same angle. Their maxima occur at slightly different angles. For the two wavelengths to be just resolved according to the Rayleigh criterion, the principal maximum of one wavelength must coincide with the first minimum of the other.\n\n3. We know from the form of the intensity envelope of an N-slit grating that the angular width (the angular separation between the central maximum and the first minimum) is given by the condition that the numerator sin(Nδ/2) first goes to zero (apart from the trivial solution δ = 0). That is, the first minimum occurs when\n\n  Nδ/2 = π  ⟹  δ = (2π/N).\n\nBut recall δ is given by\n  δ = (2π/λ)d sinθ,\nso in the vicinity of the mth maximum (where d sinθ = mλ) a small change Δλ will shift δ by\n  Δδ = (2πd sinθ/λ²) Δλ.\nAt the maximum, d sinθ = mλ, hence\n  Δδ = (2πmλ/λ²) Δλ = (2πm/λ) Δλ.\n\n4. Equate the shift in δ to the angular width of the principal maximum (in phase):\n  (2π m/λ) Δλ = 2π/N.\nCanceling 2π from both sides gives\n  m(Δλ/λ) = 1/N ⟹  Δλ/λ = 1/(mN).\n\n5. Thus the resolving power R (which is the reciprocal of Δλ/λ) is\n\n  R = λ/Δλ = mN.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The intensity distribution as a function of angle is\n\n  I(θ) = I(0) [ sin((Nπd sinθ)/λ) / sin((πd sinθ)/λ) ]².\n\n(b) The resolving power in order m is given by\n\n  Δλ/λ = 1/(mN),  or equivalently,  R = mN.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Latex boxed format:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & I(\\theta) = I(0)\\left[\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{N\\pi d\\sin\\theta}{\\lambda}\\right)}\n{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi d\\sin\\theta}{\\lambda}\\right)}\\right]^2, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{mN}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & I(\\theta) = I(0)\\left[\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{N\\pi d\\sin\\theta}{\\lambda}\\right)}\n{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi d\\sin\\theta}{\\lambda}\\right)}\\right]^2, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{mN}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & I(\\theta) = I(0)\\left[\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{N\\pi d\\sin\\theta}{\\lambda}\\right)}\n{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi d\\sin\\theta}{\\lambda}\\right)}\\right]^2, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{mN}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "I = I_0 \\frac{\\sin^2 \\left( \\frac{N \\pi}{\\lambda} d \\sin \\theta \\right)}{\\sin^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{\\lambda} d \\sin \\theta \\right)}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & I(\\theta) = I(0)\\left[\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{N\\pi d\\sin\\theta}{\\lambda}\\right)}\n{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi d\\sin\\theta}{\\lambda}\\right)}\\right]^2, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{mN}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{mN}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

The Idea of the Experiment\n\nA laser beam is sent through an optical element that “splits” it (for example, a double‐slit or a diffraction grating). As a result, you see on a screen a pattern consisting of a bright central maximum and a series of secondary (or “order‐m”) maxima on either side. Since all the light comes from one coherent source, the interference of the different “parts” of the beam produces these fringes. Although the optical element is micro‐structured, its periodic spacing is provided by the apparatus (often printed in a small label or given in the lab instructions).\n\nFor instance, when a beam is diffracted by a grating whose “line‐spacing” is d, the grating equation tells us that the angles θ at which we see bright “orders” satisfy\n\n  d sinθ = m λ        (1)\n\nwith m = 0, ±1, ±2, ….\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2.

(See the rough sketch below for the geometry, where we define a coordinate system with Lens 1 at x = 0 and the positive x‐axis directed to the right.)\n\nStep 1. (Image formed by Lens 1)\n\nThe object is at a distance dₒ₁ = 40 cm (to the left of Lens 1).\n\nUsing the thin lens formula for Lens 1:\n  1/f₁ = 1/dₒ₁ + 1/dᵢ₁,\nwe have\n\n  1/10 = 1/40 + 1/dᵢ₁   ⇒ 1/dᵢ₁ = 1/10 – 1/40.\nWriting the fractions with a common denominator:\n  1/10 = 4/40  so  1/dᵢ₁ = (4/40 – 1/40) = 3/40.\nThus,\n  dᵢ₁ = 40/3 ≈ 13.33 cm.\n\nThis means the image formed by Lens 1 is 13.33 cm to the right of Lens 1.\n\nThe lateral magnification of Lens 1 is given by\n  m₁ = – dᵢ₁/dₒ₁ = – (40/3)/40 = – 1/3.\nSo the image has a height h₁ = m₁·h = –h/3 (the minus sign indicates the image is inverted relative to the object).\n\nStep 2. (Image formed by Lens 2)\n\nLens 2 is 30 cm to the right of Lens 1. The image from Lens 1 serves as the object for Lens 2. Its location is x = +13.33 cm (relative to Lens 1), so the distance from Lens 2 is:\n\n  dₒ₂ = (distance between Lens 2 and image) = 30 cm – 13.33 cm = 16.67 cm.\nIn exact form, note that\n  dₒ₂ = 30 – (40/3) = (90 – 40)/3 = 50/3 cm.\n\nFor Lens 2 we have f₂ = 20 cm.

Its continuation is used to locate the intermediate image point.\n  • From the intermediate image (formed by Lens 1 at x = 13.33 cm), rays are traced to Lens 2. Since the intermediate image serves as the object for Lens 2, drawing at least one ray from this point through Lens 2 (taking into account the virtual nature of the object for Lens 2) is needed.\n  • A ray emerging from Lens 2 appears to come from the final image location (by backward extrapolation of the diverging rays).\n\nA simplified version of the ray diagram is as follows:\n\n  1. Draw a horizontal line representing the principal axis.\n  2. Mark the positions: Object at x = –40 cm; Lens 1 at x = 0; intermediate image (from Lens 1) at x ≈ +13.33 cm; and Lens 2 at x = +30 cm.\n  3. From the top of the object, draw:\n   – A ray parallel to the principal axis hitting Lens 1; it then refracts through the focal point of Lens 1.\n   – A ray through the center of Lens 1 (goes straight without deviation) meeting the intermediate image.\n  4. For Lens 2, draw rays coming from the intermediate image. When these rays meet Lens 2, they refract such that, if extended backward on the object side of Lens 2, they appear to converge at a point 100 cm to the left of Lens 2. This defines the position of the final (virtual) image.\n  5.

The Case of an Opaque Disk\n\nBabinet’s principle tells us that the sum of the fields produced by two complementary screens (one having an aperture where the other has an obstruction) is equal to the field in the absence of any obstacle. That is, if U₍disk₎(0) is the field on axis when there is an opaque disk and U₍hole₎(0) is that due to the complementary circular aperture (hole), then\n\n  U₍disk₎(0) + U₍hole₎(0) = U_free(0) = U₀ exp(ikL).\nThus, using (4) for U₍hole₎(0) one finds\n\n  U₍disk₎(0) = U₀ exp(ikL) – U₍hole₎(0)\n        = U₀ exp(ikL) – U₀ exp(ikL)[1 – exp(iΦ)]\n        = U₀ exp(ikL) exp(iΦ).\nSince a phase factor does not change the intensity, we have\n\n  I₍disk₎(0) = I₀.  (7)\n\nThis is the famous Arago spot: although a large opaque disk blocks a central part of the incoming wave, diffraction from its edge interferes constructively on axis so that the intensity there is the same as that of the unobstructed beam.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\nThus, we may state that for L ≫ R:\n\n(a) With an opaque circular disk of radius R the intensity on axis is\n\n  I₍disk₎(0) = I₀.\n\n(b) With an opaque screen having a circular hole of radius R the on‐axis intensity is\n\n  I₍hole₎(0) = 4 I₀ sin²((πR²)/(2λL))\n       ≈ I₀ (πR²/(λL))²    (for (πR²)/(2λL) ≪ 1).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad I_{\\text{disk}}(0) &= I_0,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad I_{\\text{hole}}(0) &= 4 I_0\\, \\sin^2\\!\\Bigl(\\frac{\\pi R^2}{2\\lambda L}\\Bigr)\n\\approx I_0\\left(\\frac{\\pi R^2}{\\lambda L}\\right)^2 \\quad \\text{(if }\\pi R^2/(2\\lambda L)\\ll 1\\text{).}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad I_{\\text{disk}}(0) &= I_0,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad I_{\\text{hole}}(0) &= 4 I_0\\, \\sin^2\\!\\Bigl(\\frac{\\pi R^2}{2\\lambda L}\\Bigr)\n\\approx I_0\\left(\\frac{\\pi R^2}{\\lambda L}\\right)^2 \\quad \\text{(if }\\pi R^2/(2\\lambda L)\\ll 1\\text{).}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad I_{\\text{disk}}(0) &= I_0,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad I_{\\text{hole}}(0) &= 4 I_0\\, \\sin^2\\!\\Bigl(\\frac{\\pi R^2}{2\\lambda L}\\Bigr)\n\\approx I_0\\left(\\frac{\\pi R^2}{\\lambda L}\\right)^2 \\quad \\text{(if }\\pi R^2/(2\\lambda L)\\ll 1\\text{).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "I' \\sim I_0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad I_{\\text{disk}}(0) &= I_0,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad I_{\\text{hole}}(0) &= 4 I_0\\, \\sin^2\\!\\Bigl(\\frac{\\pi R^2}{2\\lambda L}\\Bigr)\n\\approx I_0\\left(\\frac{\\pi R^2}{\\lambda L}\\right)^2 \\quad \\text{(if }\\pi R^2/(2\\lambda L)\\ll 1\\text{).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "I \\sim 4I_0 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{kR^2}{4L}\\right)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

When a plane wave of monochromatic light of wavelength λ is incident on the grating, the light emerging from the different rulings acquires a phase difference due to the different optical paths. If we choose an angle θ from the normal, the extra path difference from one ruling to the next is\n  Δ = d sin θ.\nThus the phase difference between light from successive rulings is \n  φ = (2π/λ)(d sin θ).\n\nSince the rulings are assumed to be “infinitely narrow” (i.e. their own diffraction is not considered) the amplitude from each ruling may be taken as A (assumed equal for all).\n\nThe complex amplitude at an angle θ is then given by the sum of the contributions from all rulings:\n  E(θ) = A + Ae^(iφ) + Ae^(i2φ) + … + Ae^(i(N–1)φ).\n\nThis geometric series can be summed to give\n  E(θ) = A exp[i(N–1)φ/2] · [sin(Nφ/2)/sin(φ/2)]\nwhere we have used the standard formula for the sum of a finite geometric series.

In what follows we explain in some detail one acceptable derivation.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. The Basic Idea\n\nWhen a charged particle of speed v passes by a grating with grooves separated by a distance d, each groove “responds” (by producing a polarized current or dipole moment) when the particle is nearby. One may idealize the situation by saying that the grating produces a series of “pulses” of electromagnetic radiation. Since the particle moves uniformly, successive pulses are produced with a fixed time delay\n\n  Δt_emission = d/v.\n\nHowever, when an observer at large distance looks at the radiation, the wave from the groove that was “hit” later (with index 2 say) has to travel a different distance than that from the groove hit earlier (index 1). For an observer looking in a direction which makes an angle θ (measured from the particle’s direction, which we will take as the x‑axis) the extra path difference is (approximately) \n\n  Δℓ = d cos θ\n           (when the grooves are arranged along the x‑axis).\n\nThus the extra propagation delay is\n\n  Δt_propagation = d cos θ / c.\n\nThese two time delays combine to give an effective “time shift” between pulses as seen by the observer\n\n  Δt_total = (d/v) − (d cos θ/c).\n\nFor constructive interference (or equivalently, to get a strong “order” m) the phase difference between pulses must be an integral multiple of 2π.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. The Phase condition\n\nA pulse radiated at one groove has a phase φ₁ = ω t. At the next groove the emission occurs delayed by d/v but then the extra propagation delay subtracts d cosθ/c. Hence the phase difference between successive contributions is\n\n  Δφ = ω (d/v − d cos θ/c) = 2π m,   m = 1, 2, 3, … .\n\nThus, the angular frequency of the radiation (in the mth “order”) is given by\n\n  ω = 2π m / [d (1/v – cos θ/c)].\n\nEquivalently, the frequency is\n\n  f = ω/(2π) = m / [d (1/v – cos θ/c)].\n\nNotice that for non‐relativistic particles (v ≪ c) the second term is small and f ≃ m v/d (nearly independent of the observation angle) but when the particle speed is a significant fraction of c the Doppler-like term cosθ/c can greatly change the observed frequency.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Answer to Part (a)\n\nThus, for a metallic diffraction grating the frequency of the emitted radiation depends on the observation angle θ via\n\n  f(θ) = m / [d (1/v – cos θ/c)]       (for integer m).\n\nIn words, as the angle of observation changes (with θ measured relative to the particle’s direction), the effective delay between pulses changes because of the extra path difference, so that the radiation is “dispersed” in frequency according to the above relation.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Answer to Part (b)\n\nNow, suppose that instead of a metallic grating one has a transmission grating (say, a piece of glass on which grooves have been ruled) with the same groove spacing d.\n\nThe critical point is that the derivation above is purely geometrical. In the metallic case the strong response (that is, the production of real currents and hence strong electromagnetic radiation) is due to the free electrons in the metal. In a transmission grating the grooves (and the inter‐groove regions) have a different dielectric response; they do not have free electrons and instead polarize only weakly. Thus, while the same geometric phase–difference argument applies, the efficiency (and even the polarization state) of the radiated light may change. In a dielectric the “pulse” produced when the particle passes is typically weaker and may be shifted in phase because of the dielectric properties (in effect, there is an extra phase delay inside the glass determined by its index of refraction). In addition, one must also keep in mind that light propagating inside a dielectric travels at c/n rather than c. However, since the radiation we are considering is that which emerges from the grating into the free space (or is measured in the plane outside the grating), the basic interference condition [as given above] remains unchanged.\n\nThus, qualitatively, the effect is the same – the frequency-angle relationship is given by the same type of time‐delay (or “phase–matching”) condition – but the amplitude (and hence the overall intensity) of the emitted radiation, along with its polarization, may be quite different from that when a metal is used.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The frequency (or angular frequency) of the radiation observed at an angle θ (with respect to the particle’s direction) is given by\n\n  ω = 2π m / [d (1/v – cos θ/c)],  or  f = m / [d (1/v – cos θ/c)],\n\nwith m = 1, 2, 3, … .\n\n(b) Replacing the metallic grating by a transmission (dielectric) grating does not change the geometric (phase‐matching) condition that determines the frequency versus angle. However, because a dielectric does not support free conduction electrons, the strength of the induced currents (or dipoles) is different, and extra phase delays due to the refractive index may occur. Hence, while the frequency–angle relation remains much the same, the overall efficiency, intensity, and polarization of the emitted radiation can change qualitatively.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\\boxed{(a)\\;\\; f(\\theta)=\\frac{m}{d\\left(\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{\\cos\\theta}{c}\\right)}\\quad\\text{with } m=1,2,\\dots;\\qquad (b)\\;\\; In\\; a\\; transmission\\; grating the same geometric phase‐condition holds but the radiation’s efficiency, phase, and polarization are altered by the dielectric (non‐metallic) response.}\\]", "final_answers": ["(a)\\;\\; f(\\theta)=\\frac{m}{d\\left(\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{\\cos\\theta}{c}\\right)}\\quad\\text{with } m=1,2,\\dots;\\qquad (b)\\;\\; In\\; a\\; transmission\\; grating the same geometric phase‐condition holds but the radiation’s efficiency, phase, and polarization are altered by the dielectric (non‐metallic) response."], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "(a)\\;\\; f(\\theta)=\\frac{m}{d\\left(\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{\\cos\\theta}{c}\\right)}\\quad\\text{with } m=1,2,\\dots;\\qquad (b)\\;\\; In\\; a\\; transmission\\; grating the same geometric phase‐condition holds but the radiation’s efficiency, phase, and polarization are altered by the dielectric (non‐metallic) response.", "expr2": "\\lambda(\\theta) = \\frac{d}{m} \\left( \\frac{c}{v} - \\cos \\theta \\right)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "(a)\\;\\; f(\\theta)=\\frac{m}{d\\left(\\frac{1}{v}-\\frac{\\cos\\theta}{c}\\right)}\\quad\\text{with } m=1,2,\\dots;\\qquad (b)\\;\\; In\\; a\\; transmission\\; grating the same geometric phase‐condition holds but the radiation’s efficiency, phase, and polarization are altered by the dielectric (non‐metallic) response.", "expr2": "\\text{No radiation is emitted with a transmission grating.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

(a) Broadening Mechanisms\n\nSeveral effects can broaden an atomic spectral line so that its observed width Δλ is larger than the “natural” linewidth (which is the intrinsic linewidth due to the finite lifetime of the excited state):\n\n1. Natural (or Lifetime) Broadening:\n • Due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (ΔEΔt ~ ℏ), even an isolated atom has a finite linewidth. This is usually extremely small compared to other effects.\n\n2. Thermal (Doppler) Broadening:\n • In a gas, atoms move with thermal velocities. Because of the Doppler effect, atoms moving toward or away from the observer shift the line frequency. In a Maxwellian distribution, this produces a Gaussian line shape with a width proportional to vₜₕ (the thermal speed). At kT = 20 eV the thermal speeds of the ions are not negligible.\n\n3.

Magnetic (Zeeman) Broadening:\n • A magnetic field splits the degenerate energy levels (the Zeeman effect). If the field is non uniform spatially, different ions will experience different splittings, and the overall observed line will be broadened.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. (b) Order‐of‐Magnitude Estimate for Doppler Broadening\n\nWe now choose Doppler broadening and make an order‐of‐magnitude estimate.\n\nFor an emitter moving with thermal speed vₜₕ, the Doppler shift is given by\n\n  Δλ ≈ λ (vₜₕ / c).\n\nFor a Maxwellian distribution the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Doppler-broadened line is\n\n  Δλ_D,FWHM = 2√(ln2) (vₜₕ/c) λ.\n\nThe thermal speed is given by\n\n  vₜₕ = √(2kT/m).\n\nFor a ¹²C ion (approximately 12 atomic mass units) we have\n\n  m ≈ 12 × 1.66 × 10⁻²⁷ kg ≃ 2.0 × 10⁻²⁶ kg.\n\nAlso, note that\n  kT = 20 eV = 20 × 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J ≃ 3.204 × 10⁻¹⁸ J.\n\nThus,\n  vₜₕ = √[ (2 × 3.204 × 10⁻¹⁸ J) / (2.0 × 10⁻²⁶ kg) ]\n     ≃ √(3.204 × 10⁸ m²/s²)\n     ≃ 1.79 × 10⁴ m/s.\n\nNow, using the Doppler FWHM formula,\n  Δλ_D,FWHM = 2√(ln2) (vₜₕ / c) λ.\n\nWe have\n  2√(ln2) = 2 × 0.8326 ≃ 1.6652,\n  vₜₕ / c = (1.79 × 10⁴ m/s) / (3.0 × 10⁸ m/s) ≃ 5.97 × 10⁻⁵,\n  and λ = 500 nm = 5.0 × 10⁻⁷ m.\n\nSo,\n  Δλ_D,FWHM = 1.6652 × (5.97 × 10⁻⁵) × (5.0 × 10⁻⁷ m)\n         ≃ 1.6652 × 2.985 × 10⁻¹¹ m\n         ≃ 4.97 × 10⁻¹¹ m.\n\nThat is, roughly 5 × 10⁻¹¹ m or 0.05 nm.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThus, (a) the observed linewidth may be broader due to natural broadening, thermal (Doppler) broadening, collisional (pressure) broadening, and Zeeman broadening from a non-uniform B-field.

{"id": "optics/3-13", "solution": "We wish to estimate the fractional widths of the spectral line from two different effects. In part (a) we use the Doppler (thermal) broadening and in part (b) we estimate collisional (pressure) broadening.\n\nIn what follows we use the following given numbers:\n • Temperature: T = 300 K \n • Pressure: p = 100 Torr \n • Mass of atom A: m = 4.2×10⁻²⁷ kg \n • Boltzmann’s constant: k_B ≅ 1.4×10⁻²³ J/K \n • Speed of light: c ≅ 3×10⁸ m/s\n\nIt is understood that the transition radiates at a frequency ν (which for many optical transitions is of order 10¹⁵ Hz), so our answers will be in the form Δν/ν (i.e. fractional linewidth).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Doppler Broadening\n\nFor a gas in thermal equilibrium the Doppler FWHM (full‐width at half maximum) is given by\n\n  Δν_D = (2 ν/c) √(2 k_B T ln2/m).\n\nThus, the fractional Doppler width (the FWHM divided by the center frequency) is\n\n  Δν_D/ν = (2/c) √(2 k_B T ln2/m)\n       = √(8 k_B T ln2/(m c²)).\n\nLet us substitute the given numbers:\n\n1. Compute the numerator inside the square root:\n  8 k_B T ln2 = 8 × (1.4×10⁻²³ J/K) × 300 K × (0.693).\n  First, 8×1.4×300 = 8×420 = 3360, so in the units we have:\n    3360×10⁻²³ J × 0.693 ≈ 3360×0.693×10⁻²³.\n  Now, 3360×0.693 ≈ 2330. So the numerator is about 2.33×10⁻²⁰ J.\n\n2. Now, compute the denominator:\n  m c² = (4.2×10⁻²⁷ kg) × (3×10⁸ m/s)² = 4.2×10⁻²⁷ kg × 9×10¹⁶ m²/s²,\n       = 3.78×10⁻¹⁰ J.\n\nThus, we obtain\n\n  Δν_D/ν = √(2.33×10⁻²⁰ J / 3.78×10⁻¹⁰ J) = √(6.16×10⁻¹¹)\n       ≈ 7.85×10⁻⁶.\n\nThus, our estimate for the Doppler width is\n\n  Δν_D/ν ≈ 8×10⁻⁶.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Pressure (Collisional) Broadening\n\nThe collisional (or pressure) broadening is roughly given by the collision rate of the excited atom with other atoms. A typical estimate is\n\n  Δν_p ~ n σ v,\n \nwhere\n • n is the number density of atoms,\n • σ is the collisional cross‐section (we must choose a “reasonable” number) and\n • v is a typical relative speed.\n\n1. First we find the number density n using the ideal gas law:\n\n  n = p/(k_B T).\n\nSince the pressure is given in Torr we must convert to SI units. (100 Torr ≈ 100×133.3 Pa = 1.33×10⁴ Pa.) Thus,\n\n  n = (1.33×10⁴ Pa) / (1.4×10⁻²³ J/K × 300 K).\n     = 1.33×10⁴ / (4.2×10⁻²¹)\n     ≈ 3.17×10²⁴ m⁻³.\n\n2. The mean speed for atoms is given by (for the relative motion),\n  v ≃ √(8 k_B T/(π m)).\nLet’s compute this value:\n\n  v ≃ √[8 × (1.4×10⁻²³ J/K) × (300 K) / (π × 4.2×10⁻²⁷ kg)].\n  Calculate the numerator:\n    8 × 1.4×10⁻²³ ≃ 11.2×10⁻²³, and then\n    11.2×10⁻²³ × 300 ≃ 3.36×10⁻²⁰.\n  Denominator: π × 4.2×10⁻²⁷ ≃ 13.2×10⁻²⁷ = 1.32×10⁻²6.\n  Thus, the quotient is:\n    (3.36×10⁻²⁰)/(1.32×10⁻²6) ≃ 2.55×10⁶.\n  Taking the square root gives:\n    v ≃ √(2.55×10⁶) ≃ 1.6×10³ m/s.\n\n3. A “reasonable” collisional cross section for an atomic collision is typically of order 10⁻¹⁴ cm². Converting to SI units:\n  10⁻¹⁴ cm² = 10⁻¹⁸ m².\nThus we take σ ≃ 1×10⁻¹⁸ m².\n\n4. Now the collisional rate becomes\n\n  Δν_p ~ n σ v = (3.17×10²⁴ m⁻³) × (1×10⁻¹⁸ m²) × (1.6×10³ m/s)\n    = 3.17×1.6×10^(24 -18 +3) s⁻¹.\n  First, 3.17×1.6 ≃ 5.07. And the exponent: 24 − 18 + 3 = 9.\n  Thus, Δν_p ~ 5.07×10⁹ Hz.\n\nNow to get the fractional width we form Δν_p/ν. For a typical optical transition we may have ν of order 10¹⁵ Hz (or perhaps 5×10¹⁴ Hz for visible light; the precise number is not given). For the purpose of the answer we simply leave the ratio in terms of a typical optical frequency. If we take, say, ν ≃ 10¹⁵ Hz then\n\n  Δν_p/ν ≃ (5×10⁹ Hz)/(10¹⁵ Hz) = 5×10⁻⁶.\n\nThus, the relative pressure‐broadening linewidth is on the order of a few parts per million (≈ 10⁻⁶). Note that if one prefers to work with a different value for σ (say 1×10⁻¹⁹ m²) the number would be lower by a factor of 10. (For “reasonable” numbers, the above choice is quite typical for atomic collisions.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The Doppler broadening gives a fractional linewidth\n\n  Δν_D/ν ≃ √(8k_BT ln2/(mc²)) ≃ 8×10⁻⁶.\n\n(b) Using n = p/(k_BT), σ ≃ 1×10⁻¹⁸ m², and v ≃ 1.6×10³ m/s, the pressure‐broadening gives\n\n  Δν_p ≃ nσv ≃ 5×10⁹ Hz, so that for an optical frequency of order 10¹⁵ Hz\n\n  Δν_p/ν ≃ 5×10⁻⁶.\n\nThus we may write the final answers as\n\n  (a) Δν_D/ν ~ 8×10⁻⁶  (b) Δν_p/ν ~ 5×10⁻⁶   (approximately).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\nu_D/\\nu &\\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{8k_BT\\ln2}{mc^2}} \\approx 8\\times10^{-6},\\\\[1mm]\n\\Delta \\nu_p/\\nu &\\sim \\; \\frac{n\\sigma v}{\\nu} \\approx 5\\times10^{-6}\\quad \\text{(for a typical optical frequency }\\nu\\sim10^{15}\\text{ Hz)}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\nu_D/\\nu &\\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{8k_BT\\ln2}{mc^2}} \\approx 8\\times10^{-6},\\\\[1mm]\n\\Delta \\nu_p/\\nu &\\sim \\; \\frac{n\\sigma v}{\\nu} \\approx 5\\times10^{-6}\\quad \\text{(for a typical optical frequency }\\nu\\sim10^{15}\\text{ Hz)}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\nu_D/\\nu &\\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{8k_BT\\ln2}{mc^2}} \\approx 8\\times10^{-6},\\\\[1mm]\n\\Delta \\nu_p/\\nu &\\sim \\; \\frac{n\\sigma v}{\\nu} \\approx 5\\times10^{-6}\\quad \\text{(for a typical optical frequency }\\nu\\sim10^{15}\\text{ Hz)}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{\\Delta \\nu_D}{\\nu} = 3 \\times 10^{-6}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\nu_D/\\nu &\\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{8k_BT\\ln2}{mc^2}} \\approx 8\\times10^{-6},\\\\[1mm]\n\\Delta \\nu_p/\\nu &\\sim \\; \\frac{n\\sigma v}{\\nu} \\approx 5\\times10^{-6}\\quad \\text{(for a typical optical frequency }\\nu\\sim10^{15}\\text{ Hz)}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{\\Delta \\nu_p}{\\nu} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-7}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

(One must be careful when converting the Gaussian parameters but the final FWHM expressed in wavelength is obtained by writing)\n\n  (Δλ)_FWHM = 2√(2 ln2) (λ₀/c) √(kT/m).\n\nLet us now substitute numbers. For sodium we have an atomic weight of 23 so that its mass is\n\n  m ≈ 23 × (1.66×10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.82×10⁻²⁶ kg.\nTemperature: T = 200°C = 200 + 273 = 473 K.\nWavelength: λ₀ = 5896 Å = 5896×10⁻¹⁰ m = 5.896×10⁻⁷ m.\nBoltzmann constant: k =1.38×10⁻²³ J/K.\nSpeed of light: c = 3×10⁸ m/s.\n\nFirst, compute the one–dimensional thermal speed:\n  σ_v = √(kT/m) = √[(1.38×10⁻²³ J/K × 473 K)/(3.82×10⁻²⁶ kg)].\nThe numerator: 1.38×10⁻²³×473 ≈ 6.53×10⁻²¹ J.\nThen,\n  σ_v ≈ √(6.53×10⁻²¹/3.82×10⁻²⁶) = √(1.71×10⁵) ≈ 413 m/s.\n\nThe FWHM (in wavelength) is therefore\n  (Δλ)_FWHM = 2√(2 ln2) (λ₀/c) σ_v.\nNote that 2√(2 ln2) ≃ 2.3548.

At a pressure p = 10 Torr we have\n  10 Torr = (10/760) atm ≃ 0.01316 atm.\nIn SI, 1 atm = 1.013×10⁵ Pa so that\n  p ≃ 0.01316 × 1.013×10⁵ Pa ≃ 1333 Pa.\nUsing the ideal–gas law, n = p/(kT):\n  n ≃ 1333 Pa/(1.38×10⁻²³ J/K × 473 K) ≃ 1333/ (6.53×10⁻²¹) ≃ 2.04×10²³ m⁻³.\n\nA typical “hard–sphere” atomic cross section is of order 10⁻¹⁹ m². (In many cases the effective “collision cross section” may be larger by a factor of a few; here we take σ ≃ 10⁻¹⁹ m².) Also, the relative speed between sodium and argon should be comparable to the thermal speed, v_rel ≃ 500 m/s.\n\nThen the collision rate (per sodium atom) is\n  γ = n σ v_rel ≃ (2.04×10²³ m⁻³)(10⁻¹⁹ m²)(500 m/s) ≃ 1.02×10⁷ s⁻¹.\nThis is the rate (in s⁻¹) at which a sodium atom is “hit” by argon atoms. In angular–frequency units, the width is Δω ≃ γ. (Sometimes one writes the half–width in frequency as γ/(2π).)\n\nLet us now write the width (FWHM in frequency units) as\n  (Δν)_FWHM ≃ Δω/(2π) ≃ (1.02×10⁷)/(2π) ≃ 1.62×10⁶ Hz.\nTo get the corresponding wavelength width we use the relation\n  Δλ ≃ (λ₀²/c) Δν.\nThus,\n  Δλ ≃ ( (5.896×10⁻⁷ m)²/(3×10⁸ m/s)) (1.62×10⁶ Hz).\nFirst, (5.896×10⁻⁷ m)² ≃ 3.477×10⁻¹³ m².\nThen,\n  (λ₀²/c) ≃ 3.477×10⁻¹³ m²/(3×10⁸ m/s) ≃ 1.159×10⁻²¹ s.\nThus,\n  Δλ ≃ 1.159×10⁻²¹ s × 1.62×10⁶ Hz ≃ 1.88×10⁻¹⁵ m.\nConverting to Ångströms:\n  1.88×10⁻¹⁵ m = 1.88×10⁻¹⁵/(10⁻¹⁰) Å ≃ 1.88×10⁻⁵ Å.\nThis is extremely small. (Often – depending on the “collision model” and details of the interatomic potential – the effective broadening is a few times larger than the simple hard–sphere estimate. For example, if one chooses a collision cross section an order of magnitude larger, σ ~ 10⁻¹⁸ m², then the width would be roughly 10× larger, i.e. Δλ ≃ 1.9×10⁻⁴ Å.) Even so, under these conditions the collisional (pressure) broadening is very much smaller than the Doppler width of about 0.02 Å. (In many laboratory situations with such a low partial pressure of sodium immersed in a buffer gas, Doppler broadening dominates.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The Doppler–broadened absorption (or emission) profile is\n\n  f(ν) = (c/ν₀) √(m/(2πkT)) exp[ – (m c²/(2kTν₀²)) (ν – ν₀)² ].\n\n(b) For the 5896 Å sodium line at T = 473 K the Doppler FWHM is about\n\n  (Δλ)_FWHM ≃ 0.02 Å.\n\n(c) With a 10 Torr argon buffer gas the simple hard–sphere collision–broadening yields\n\n  (Δλ)_collisional ≃ a few ×10⁻⁵–10⁻⁴ Å,\ni.e. roughly 0.0002 Å if one adopts a somewhat larger effective cross section.

{"id": "optics/3-15", "solution": "We wish to understand the observed deep blue of the sky in terms of scattering by air molecules and then discuss how fluctuations in the molecular density enter the picture. One may show step‐by‐step that the usual Rayleigh scattering law arises from a frequency–independent polarizability and then see what happens when the number of molecules in a “cell” is taken as exactly constant or fluctuates.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(a) Wavelength and Angular Dependence from a Frequency‐Independent α\n\nAn atom (or molecule) exposed to an electromagnetic wave of electric field E acquires an induced dipole moment\n\n  p = αE\n\nwith α the (electric) polarizability. Suppose that α is independent of the angular frequency ω of the light. In classical dipole radiation the amplitude of the radiated field is proportional to the acceleration of the dipole, which in turn (by the harmonic time–dependence exp(–iωt)) brings in a factor ω². More precisely the radiated field from a dipole scales as\n\n  E_scattered ∝ ω²p ∝ ω²αE.\n\nThus, when one squares the amplitude to find the intensity, one finds\n\n  I_scattered ∝ (ω²α)²|E|² ∝ ω^4 |E|².\n\nSince ω = 2πc/λ it follows that\n\n  I_scattered ∝ λ^–4.\n\nThis is just what is observed in the blue sky: for shorter wavelengths (blue) the scattering is much more intense than for longer (red).\n\nThe angular dependence of dipole radiation is given by the well known pattern. For a dipole oriented along a fixed direction, the radiated intensity is proportional to sin²θ, where θ is the angle between the oscillation direction and the observation direction. (If the incident light is unpolarized or if we average over all possible orientations, one obtains an angular dependence proportional to 1 + cos²θ.) Thus, aside from the λ^–4 factor, one has\n\n  (dσ/dΩ) ∝ 1 + cos²θ\n\nwhich is the textbook result for Rayleigh scattering.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(b) Scattering from a Uniform Medium (No Fluctuations)\n\nNow consider an infinitesimal volume element ΔV, with sides small compared with the wavelength λ. Suppose that the mean number of molecules in ΔV is N₀ΔV ≫ 1 and assume that there is no fluctuation about this mean – that is, the number of molecules in any ΔV is exactly constant. In this circumstance the local density is uniform.\n\nTo compute the scattered field from this cell one must add coherently the fields from all molecules. Since ΔV is small compared with λ, all molecules have nearly the same phase – i.e. the phase delay between molecules is negligible. Consequently the net dipole moment per cell is just N₀ΔV p. However, when one “stacks” these cells in space to form a uniform medium, the contributions from different cells interfere. In fact, the Fourier transform of a constant spatial density is a delta–function in momentum space. This means that only the forward–scattered light survives. For any angle other than forward, there is complete destructive interference. Thus if there are no local fluctuations in the molecular density, there will be no net scattering away from the forward direction.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(c) Scattering from Fluctuations (Incoherent Addition)\n\nNow suppose that instead the number of molecules in a cell fluctuates about the mean according to Poisson statistics. That is, if the mean number is N, the rms fluctuation is\n\n  ΔN_rms = √N.\n\nEven though the average density is uniform, these fluctuations mean that, in a given cell, the “excess” dipole moment is proportional to √N. When calculating the net intensity scattered from a large number of such cells, the contributions from different cells are incoherent (the phases are essentially random from one cell to the next for angles off forward). Therefore the intensities (rather than the amplitudes) add. In other words, the total scattered intensity is proportional to the number of independent “fluctuation cells”. This has exactly the same dependence as if every molecule scattered independently. Hence we recover the usual Rayleigh scattering intensity law with I_scattered ∝ N₀ (when the fluctuations are of order √N) and no interference between molecules.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(d) Enhanced Scattering at High Humidity\n\nWhen the relative humidity is very high (near 100%), water molecules have an increased tendency to form clusters or even small droplets. In other words, the local fluctuations in the density of scatterers are enhanced, i.e. the variance is larger than the √N expected from purely random (Poisson) fluctuations. Moreover, if the droplets are small compared to the wavelength, they act as “super–scatterers” (with an effective polarizability proportional to the number of molecules in the droplet, and hence an intensity that goes roughly as the square of that number). In either case, the net effect is that the scattering is enhanced over that expected from independent, non–interfering scattering by individual molecules. (There can be additional complications from actual Mie scattering if the droplets are comparable to λ, but here the observation concerns the enhanced Rayleigh scattering regime.) Thus, the enhanced scattering observed at high relative humidity arises because the fluctuations in the local water density are increased — either due to clustering or condensation. \n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThus, we have shown:\n\n(a) With a frequency–independent polarizability α, the scattered intensity scales as I ∝ ω^4, i.e. ∝ λ^–4, with an angular dependence given by (dσ/dΩ) ∝ 1 + cos²θ.\n\n(b) In a volume element ΔV with constant density (N₀ΔV exactly), the scattered fields add coherently to yield only forward scattering, so away from the forward direction there is no net scattering.\n\n(c) If the number of molecules fluctuates with rms amplitude √N, the scattering intensity is that obtained by summing the contributions of independent molecules (with no interference), recovering the conventional Rayleigh result.\n\n(d) When the relative humidity is near 100%, water molecules tend to form clusters or droplets, which enhances the local density fluctuations above the √N level. As a result, the scattering is enhanced relative to that from independent molecules.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) Since } p=\\alpha E \\text{, an oscillating dipole radiates with amplitude } E_{\\rm sc}\\propto \\omega^2 \\alpha E \\\\\n&\\quad\\text{so that } I_{\\rm sc}\\propto \\omega^4 \\propto \\lambda^{-4}. \\text{ Its angular distribution is } \n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega}\\propto 1+\\cos^2\\theta.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b) In a uniform volume element (with exactly } N_0\\Delta V \\text{ molecules), the spatial Fourier}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{transform is a delta-function so that apart from forward scattering the contributions cancel.}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(c) If the number fluctuates with } \\Delta N_{\\rm rms}\\sim \\sqrt{N}\\text{, the incoherent summing of}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{fluctuating dipoles yields net scattering intensity proportional to } N_0 \\text{ as if molecules}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{scattered independently.}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(d) At high relative humidity, the water molecules tend to cluster or condense, leading to}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{enhanced density fluctuations (or “super–scatterers”), and hence enhanced scattering intensity.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) Since } p=\\alpha E \\text{, an oscillating dipole radiates with amplitude } E_{\\rm sc}\\propto \\omega^2 \\alpha E \\\\\n&\\quad\\text{so that } I_{\\rm sc}\\propto \\omega^4 \\propto \\lambda^{-4}. \\text{ Its angular distribution is } \n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega}\\propto 1+\\cos^2\\theta.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b) In a uniform volume element (with exactly } N_0\\Delta V \\text{ molecules), the spatial Fourier}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{transform is a delta-function so that apart from forward scattering the contributions cancel.}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(c) If the number fluctuates with } \\Delta N_{\\rm rms}\\sim \\sqrt{N}\\text{, the incoherent summing of}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{fluctuating dipoles yields net scattering intensity proportional to } N_0 \\text{ as if molecules}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{scattered independently.}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(d) At high relative humidity, the water molecules tend to cluster or condense, leading to}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{enhanced density fluctuations (or “super–scatterers”), and hence enhanced scattering intensity.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) Since } p=\\alpha E \\text{, an oscillating dipole radiates with amplitude } E_{\\rm sc}\\propto \\omega^2 \\alpha E \\\\\n&\\quad\\text{so that } I_{\\rm sc}\\propto \\omega^4 \\propto \\lambda^{-4}. \\text{ Its angular distribution is } \n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega}\\propto 1+\\cos^2\\theta.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b) In a uniform volume element (with exactly } N_0\\Delta V \\text{ molecules), the spatial Fourier}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{transform is a delta-function so that apart from forward scattering the contributions cancel.}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(c) If the number fluctuates with } \\Delta N_{\\rm rms}\\sim \\sqrt{N}\\text{, the incoherent summing of}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{fluctuating dipoles yields net scattering intensity proportional to } N_0 \\text{ as if molecules}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{scattered independently.}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(d) At high relative humidity, the water molecules tend to cluster or condense, leading to}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{enhanced density fluctuations (or “super–scatterers”), and hence enhanced scattering intensity.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "I \\propto \\frac{1}{\\lambda^4}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "optics/3-24", "solution": "We begin by noting that if the water’s surface were permanently fixed, then when light passes from one medium to another the frequency would be preserved. However, in this scenario the water is being added so that its free surface is rising. Although the fish is at rest relative to the water, the water–air interface is moving upward relative to the stationary light source. This introduces a Doppler-type effect when the light “crosses” the moving boundary.\n\nLet the monochromatic light source in air have angular frequency ω₀ and wave number k₀ = ω₀/c. In the water the dispersion is such that for a given angular frequency ω the wave number is k = nω/c, where n > 1 is the index of refraction. Now, suppose that at the water’s free surface (which is moving upward with speed V) the phase of the light must be continuous along the surface. (In other words, the phase on the moving boundary is “frozen”.) If we call the transmitted frequency ω_T, then on the interface z = Vt the phase of the incident wave is\n\n  Φ_incident = k₀(Vt) − ω₀t,\nand the phase of the transmitted wave in water is\n  Φ_transmitted = k (Vt) − ω_Tt.\n\nSince the phase must match at the boundary for all t, we require\n  k₀Vt − ω₀t = kVt − ω_Tt  for all t.\nThis gives\n  ω_T = ω₀ − V(k₀ − k).\n\nBut since in water k = nω_T/c and k₀ = ω₀/c, we have\n  ω_T = ω₀ − V(ω₀/c − nω_T/c)\n    = ω₀ − (Vω₀/c) + (nVω_T/c).\n\nRearrange to solve for ω_T:\n  ω_T − (nV/c) ω_T = ω₀ (1 − V/c)\n  ω_T (1 − nV/c) = ω₀ (1 − V/c).\n\nThus,\n  ω_T = ω₀ (1 − V/c)/(1 − nV/c).\n\nFor a rising water surface, V > 0. Notice that when n > 1 the denominator (1 − nV/c) is smaller than the numerator (1 − V/c) (for V/c ≪ 1), so ω_T > ω₀. That is, the frequency in the water is higher than the original frequency. (A first‐order expansion in V/c shows that\n  ω_T ≈ ω₀ [1 + (n − 1)(V/c)], \nconfirming that the shift is to higher frequencies.)\n\nThus, even though the fish remains at rest in the water, the fact that the light is transmitted across a rising (moving) boundary means the fish sees the light blue‐shifted compared to the frequency emitted by the source.\n\nFinal Answer:\n            \n  \n  \\[ \\boxed{\\text{Blue-shifted (the fish sees a higher frequency than the source emits)}}. \\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Blue-shifted (the fish sees a higher frequency than the source emits)}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Blue-shifted (the fish sees a higher frequency than the source emits)}", "expr2": "\\text{Red-shifted}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "optics/2-70", "solution": "We begin by noting that each parabolic dish (of diameter D) is fed so that its aperture is almost uniformly illuminated. Since the wavelength is much smaller than the dish size (λ ≪ D), the far‐field pattern of one dish is given by the Fraunhofer diffraction of a uniformly‐illuminated circular aperture. Let’s now work step by step.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (a): Single Antenna\n\nFor a uniformly illuminated circular aperture of diameter D the far–field diffraction pattern is given by the so–called “Airy pattern”. Its amplitude is proportional to\n\n  A(θ) ∝ (2J₁(ka sinθ))/(ka sinθ)\n\nwhere k = 2π/λ and J₁ is the first Bessel function. The intensity is proportional to A(θ)². The main lobe has an angular half–width (first null) of order\n\n  θ₁ ≃ 1.22 (λ/D).\n\nThus, the pattern is essentially that of a central bright spot (with circular symmetry about the “zenith” direction, i.e. straight upward) surrounded by a series of concentric rings. The “far–field” condition here means that r ≫ D²/λ.\n\nA sketch would show the dish (a circle) with an arrow upward and its far–field pattern as a central lobe of angular width roughly λ/D with dimmer side lobes as concentric rings.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (b): Two Antennae Driven In Phase\n\nNow consider two identical dishes separated by a distance d (with d ≫ D) and both pointing straight up. Each produces an Airy-type envelope as described above. However, when they are driven in phase by the same transmitter, the fields from both antennas add coherently. In the far field (r ≫ d and r ≫ D²/λ) the radiation fields add with a relative phase that depends on the path–difference between the two dishes. (See the sketch: two circles separated by d, with rays to a far field point making an angle θ from vertical.)\n\nThe relative phase difference is approximately\n\n  ϕ = k d sinθ   , where k = 2π/λ.\n\nThus, the total field is proportional to the product of the single–antenna pattern and an interference factor\n\n  E_total(θ) ∝ [Airy envelope] × 2 cos (ϕ/2) \n         ∝ [Airy envelope] × 2 cos (π d sinθ/λ).\n\nAccordingly, the intensity pattern is\n\n  I(θ) ∝ (Airy pattern) × 4 cos²(π d sinθ/λ).\n\nBecause d ≫ D, the angular spacing of the interference fringes is much smaller than the angular width λ/D of the single dish pattern. (The spacing between maxima in the interference part is roughly given by Δθ ≃ λ/d.) In a sketch one would draw the single dish’s central lobe (the “envelope”) and then indicate that inside that envelope there are many narrow interference fringes.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (c): Two Separate Transmitters\n\nSuppose now that instead of the same transmitter driving both dishes, we use two separated transmitters. In order that the interference pattern described in part (b) remain essentially stationary over a time interval t, the relative phase between the transmitters must not drift appreciably during that time. \n\nIf the two transmitters have slightly different frequencies, f and f + Δf, then the phase difference will be time–dependent. In particular, the relative phase difference will vary as\n\n  Δϕ(t) = 2π (Δf) t.\n\nFor the interference pattern to be “essentially stationary” (that is, to change only negligibly, say much less than 1 radian), we require\n\n  2π (Δf) t ≪ 1   →  Δf ≪ 1/(2π t).\n\nOften one will simply require that the frequency difference satisfy\n\n  Δf ≪ 1/t,\n \nso that during any observation time t the phase difference does not change significantly. This is the requirement on the frequency stability of the two transmitters for maintaining a stable interference fringe pattern.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) For a single dish, the far–field radiation pattern is approximately an Airy pattern – a central bright circular lobe with angular half–width on the order of θ ≃ 1.22 (λ/D) (with a series of dimmer concentric rings), valid for r ≫ D²/λ.\n\n(b) When two identical antennas separated by d ≫ D are driven in phase, the overall far–field pattern is the product of the single–dish Airy envelope and an interference factor, leading to intensity \n  I(θ) ∝ [Airy pattern] × cos²(πd sinθ/λ).\nThus, the envelope is that of (a) while the fringes have an angular spacing approximately Δθ ≃ λ/d.\n\n(c) When the two antennae are driven by separate transmitters, to keep the interference pattern essentially fixed for a duration t the frequency difference Δf must satisfy\n  Δf ≪ 1/t.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\text{The radiation is that of a uniformly–illuminated circular aperture: an Airy pattern with a central lobe of angular width }\\theta\\sim 1.22\\,\\lambda/D,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{The two dishes radiate an envelope given by (a) modulated by interference fringes } \\propto\\cos^2\\Bigl(\\pi d \\sin\\theta/\\lambda\\Bigr); \\text{ the fringe spacing is } \\Delta\\theta\\sim\\lambda/d,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{To keep the interference pattern stationary for time }t,\\ \\Delta f\\ll 1/t\\text{.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\text{The radiation is that of a uniformly–illuminated circular aperture: an Airy pattern with a central lobe of angular width }\\theta\\sim 1.22\\,\\lambda/D,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{The two dishes radiate an envelope given by (a) modulated by interference fringes } \\propto\\cos^2\\Bigl(\\pi d \\sin\\theta/\\lambda\\Bigr); \\text{ the fringe spacing is } \\Delta\\theta\\sim\\lambda/d,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{To keep the interference pattern stationary for time }t,\\ \\Delta f\\ll 1/t\\text{.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\text{The radiation is that of a uniformly–illuminated circular aperture: an Airy pattern with a central lobe of angular width }\\theta\\sim 1.22\\,\\lambda/D,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{The two dishes radiate an envelope given by (a) modulated by interference fringes } \\propto\\cos^2\\Bigl(\\pi d \\sin\\theta/\\lambda\\Bigr); \\text{ the fringe spacing is } \\Delta\\theta\\sim\\lambda/d,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{To keep the interference pattern stationary for time }t,\\ \\Delta f\\ll 1/t\\text{.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "I = I(0) \\left[ \\frac{2J_1(kR \\sin \\theta)}{kR \\sin \\theta} \\right]^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\text{The radiation is that of a uniformly–illuminated circular aperture: an Airy pattern with a central lobe of angular width }\\theta\\sim 1.22\\,\\lambda/D,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{The two dishes radiate an envelope given by (a) modulated by interference fringes } \\propto\\cos^2\\Bigl(\\pi d \\sin\\theta/\\lambda\\Bigr); \\text{ the fringe spacing is } \\Delta\\theta\\sim\\lambda/d,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{To keep the interference pattern stationary for time }t,\\ \\Delta f\\ll 1/t\\text{.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "I = I(0) \\left[ \\frac{2J_1(kR \\sin \\theta)}{kR \\sin \\theta} \\right]^2 \\cos^2 \\alpha"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Fourier Transform of the Apodized Aperture\n\nThe Fraunhofer amplitude is given by the Fourier transform of A(x):\n\n  F(θ) = ∫₋b/2^(b/2) cos (πx/b) e^(i k x sinθ) dx.\n     = ½ ∫₋b/2^(b/2) {e^(iπx/b) + e^(–iπx/b)} e^(i k x sinθ) dx\n     = ½ {I₊ + I₋},\nwhere\n  I₊ = ∫₋b/2^(b/2) e^(i (k sinθ + π/b)x) dx  and  \n  I₋ = ∫₋b/2^(b/2) e^(i (k sinθ – π/b)x) dx.\nEach of these integrals is elementary:\n  I(α) = ∫₋b/2^(b/2) e^(iαx) dx = (2 sin (αb/2))/α.\nThus,\n  F(θ) = ½ { [2 sin((k sinθ + π/b)(b/2))/(k sinθ + π/b) ] + [2 sin((k sinθ – π/b)(b/2))/(k sinθ – π/b) ] }.\nLet us now define\n  φ = (k b sinθ)/2  so that (k sinθ ± π/b)(b/2) = φ ± (π/2).\nThen\n  F(θ) = sin(φ + π/2)/(k sinθ + π/b) + sin(φ – π/2)/(k sinθ – π/b).\n\nIt is very convenient now to re‐write the denominators in terms of φ. Noting that\n  k = 2π/λ  and that by definition φ = (k b sinθ)/2,\none may show after a short algebraic manipulation that one may write the final answer in the form\n\n  F(θ) = –[2πb · cos φ]⁄[4φ² – π²].\n                                 (1)\n\nThus the diffraction intensity is\n\n  I(θ) ∝ |F(θ)|² = (2πb)² cos²φ/(4φ² – π²)².\n                                  (2)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. (a) Positions of the Minima\n\nIn typical single–slit diffraction the amplitude (apart from an overall phase) is proportional to (“sinc”)\n  F_regular(θ) ∝ b [sin φ]/φ \nwith intensity zeros when sin φ = 0 (with the trivial zero at φ = 0 removed). In particular, the n‑th minimum (counting n = 1,2,…) occurs at\n\n  φ = nπ  or  (kb sinθ)/2 = nπ  ⟹ sinθ = nλ/b.\n                                 (“unapodized”)\n\nNow, for the apodized case we see from (1) that aside from the factor in the denominator (which is everywhere nonzero except at the removable singularities when 4φ² = π²) the angular dependence is given by cos φ. (A short exercise in limits shows that the points at which 4φ² – π² = 0, that is φ = ±π/2, do not give zeros of F but rather finite values.) Hence the “zeros” of the amplitude occur when\n\n  cos φ = 0.\nThat is,\n  φ = (2n + 1)π/2,  n = 0, ±1, ±2, …  (3)\n\nNow one must take care. When n = 0 one obtains φ = π/2. In fact one may check that at φ = π/2 the two contributions in the original expression for F(θ) actually add to a finite value (the 0/0 “singularity” is removable). Thus the first “true” zero in the apodized pattern occurs for n = 1 (i.e. on the positive–θ side)\n  φ = 3π/2.\nRecalling that φ = (k b sinθ)/2, that is\n\n  (kb sinθ_n)/2 = (2n + 1)π/2 ⟹  sinθ_n = [(2n + 1)π]⁄(k b).\nBut k = 2π/λ so that\n\n  sinθ_n = (2n + 1)λ⁄(4b),  n = 1, 2, 3, …  (4)\n\nThus, in words, the positions of the minima for the apodized slit are given by\n\n  n‑th minimum: sinθ_n^(apodized) = (2n + 1)λ/(4b)\nwhile for the uniform (unapodized) slit one has\n\n  n‑th minimum: sinθ_n^(unapodized) = nλ/b.\nIn particular, note that even the first minimum (n = 1) is shifted; for the uniform slit it lies at sinθ = λ/b while for the apodized slit the (first “true”) minimum is at sinθ = 3λ/(4b). (Other authors may choose to index the minima differently; the essential point is that the apodization “pushes” the minima outward.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. (b) Intensity at the “n‑th maximum”\n\nIt turns out that the principal “maxima” of the apodized pattern do not lie at the center of the “lobes” bounded by the zeros of cos φ but (once again because of the extra factor in the denominator) very nearly halfway between the successive minima. A convenient way to obtain an analytic answer is to re–express the Fourier transform in another (equivalent) form. In fact one may show (by using the modulation property of the Fourier transform) that\n  F(θ) = b⁄2 [ sinc (φ – π/2) + sinc (φ + π/2) ],  (5)\nwhere we recall that\n  sinc(x) ≡ sin x/x.\nOne may check that (5) is equivalent to (1) (the algebra is left as an exercise).\nNow, the “maxima” occur approximately at the midpoint between two successive zeros of (5). Since we have seen that the zeros are determined by cos φ = 0 [apart from the removable singularity at φ = π/2], a good approximation is to take the n‑th maximum to lie at\n\n  φ = nπ,  (n = 1, 2, …).\nAt such an angle, (5) gives\n\n  F(nπ) = b⁄2 [ sinc (nπ – π/2) + sinc (nπ + π/2) ]\n      = b⁄2 [ sin((n – ½)π)/((n – ½)π) + sin((n + ½)π)/((n + ½)π) ].\nOne may show that\n  sin((n – ½)π) = (–1)^(n–1)\n  sin((n + ½)π) = (–1)^(n),\nso that\n  F(nπ) = b⁄2·(–1)^(n–1) [ 1/((n – ½)π) – 1/((n + ½)π) ].\nA short calculation shows that\n  1/(n – ½) – 1/(n + ½) = 1/(n² – 1/4).\nThus,\n  |F(nπ)| = b⁄(2π) · 1/(n² – 1/4).  (6)\nThe intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude.

{"id": "optics/1-35", "solution": "We will answer each part step‐by‐step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPart (a): Derivation of the Lensmaker’s Formula\n\nConsider a thin lens made of material with index of refraction n (with the surrounding medium taken as air, n₀ ≃ 1). Its two spherical surfaces have radii R and R′. (The sign convention is that a convex surface has positive radius if its center of curvature is to the right of the surface for a light ray traveling from left to right.)\n\nA basic way to arrive at the lensmaker’s formula is to “add” the refractions at the two surfaces, under the paraxial (small‐angle) approximation. For refraction at a spherical surface one may show that\n  (1) n₁/s + n₂/s′ = (n₂ – n₁)/R,\nwhere s is the object distance and s′ the image distance from the surface. (Be careful with sign conventions.)\n\nNow, let the first surface (with radius R) separate air (n₁=1) from glass (n₂=n). If we form the image by refraction on the first surface, using (1) we have\n\n  1/s + n/s₁ = (n – 1)/R          (1a)\n\nHere s is the object distance (assumed large, so that in the thin‐lens approximation we can eventually set s → ∞) and s₁ is the image distance inside the glass.\n\nNow, the light enters the glass and reaches the second surface (with radius R′) where it goes from glass (n₁=n) to air (n₂=1). Again applying (1) (with the appropriate distances measured from the second surface) we have\n\n  n/(–s₁′) + 1/s′ = (1 – n)/R′      (1b)\n    or   n/s₁′ – 1/s′ = (n – 1)/R′.\n\nHere s₁′ is the distance from the second surface to the “object” for the second refraction (and one must take proper signs; in the thin lens approximation, one can show that to first order s₁′ ≃ s₁). Combining (1a) and (1b) and using the thin lens assumption (that the thickness is negligible, so that one can identify the intermediate image distances) one finds after some algebra that the power (1/f with f the focal length) of the lens is given by\n\n  1/f = (n – 1) [1/R + 1/R′].\n\nThus we obtain the well-known Lensmaker’s formula for a thin lens.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPart (b): Achromatic Doublet Condition\n\nWhen two lenses made of different glasses (here “crown” and “flint”) are cemented together, we can “tune” the dispersive effects so that the overall focal length is independent of wavelength (to first order in the wavelength spread). If the focal lengths of the individual components are f_c (crown) and f_t (flint), then their powers add. However, the refractive index in each glass varies with wavelength (with dispersion characterized by dn/dλ). Let the “dispersion parameter” be defined as\n\n  Δ = (1/(n̄ – 1)) (dn/dλ) Δλ,\n \nwhere n̄ is the value of the index at the center of the visible spectrum and Δλ is roughly the spread of wavelengths (about 3000 Å). Then, to first order in wavelength, one finds that the change in the power (1/f) of each element is proportional to Δ, so that the crown and flint glasses experience modifications in their powers given by (Δ_c)/f_c and (Δ_f)/f_t, respectively. For the composite (achromatic) lens the first order dependence on wavelength must cancel; that is, we require\n\n  (Δ_c)/f_c + (Δ_f)/f_t = 0.\n\nThis is the condition for achromatism: the change in optical power with wavelength for the crown lens is exactly canceled by that from the flint lens.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPart (c): Signs for the Achromatic System\n\nIn an achromatic doublet the goal is to obtain a net converging lens (with an overall positive focal length). We are given that\n\n  Δ_c = 0.0169  (crown glass)   and  Δ_f = 0.0384  (flint glass).\n\nSince both Δ’s are positive numbers, the cancellation condition\n\n  (Δ_c)/f_c + (Δ_f)/f_t = 0      (2)\n  ⟹ (Δ_c)/f_c = – (Δ_f)/f_t\n\ntells us that the two powers (1/f) must have opposite signs. This immediately tells us that if we choose the crown glass lens to have positive focal length (that is, it is converging, so that f_c > 0), then the flint glass lens must have negative focal length (f_t < 0, i.e. diverging). In other words, to construct a converging achromatic lens one must cement together a converging crown lens and a diverging flint lens.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThus, we have shown:\n\n(a) A thin lens obeys the Lensmaker’s formula\n  1/f = (n – 1)[1/R + 1/R′].\n\n(b) To cancel the chromatic dispersion, the powers of the crown and flint components must satisfy\n  (Δ_c)/f_c + (Δ_f)/f_t = 0.\n\n(c) Since Δ_c and Δ_f are both positive, the cancellation condition implies that if the crown lens is converging (f_c > 0), then the flint lens must be diverging (f_t < 0). This is the required condition to obtain a converging achromatic doublet.\n\nFinal answer in boxed form:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) } \\frac{1}{f} = (n-1)\\left(\\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{R'}\\right). \\\\\n\\text{(b) Achromatism requires } \\frac{\\Delta_c}{f_c} + \\frac{\\Delta_f}{f_t} = 0. \\\\\n\\text{(c) Since } \\Delta_c, \\Delta_f >0, \\text{ one must have } f_c>0 \\text{ (converging crown) and } f_t<0 \\text{ (diverging flint).}\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) } \\frac{1}{f} = (n-1)\\left(\\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{R'}\\right). \\\\\n\\text{(b) Achromatism requires } \\frac{\\Delta_c}{f_c} + \\frac{\\Delta_f}{f_t} = 0. \\\\\n\\text{(c) Since } \\Delta_c, \\Delta_f >0, \\text{ one must have } f_c>0 \\text{ (converging crown) and } f_t<0 \\text{ (diverging flint).}\n\\end{array}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) } \\frac{1}{f} = (n-1)\\left(\\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{R'}\\right). \\\\\n\\text{(b) Achromatism requires } \\frac{\\Delta_c}{f_c} + \\frac{\\Delta_f}{f_t} = 0. \\\\\n\\text{(c) Since } \\Delta_c, \\Delta_f >0, \\text{ one must have } f_c>0 \\text{ (converging crown) and } f_t<0 \\text{ (diverging flint).}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "\\frac{\\Delta_c}{f_c} + \\frac{\\Delta_f}{f_t} = 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "optics/2-5", "solution": "We can analyze the experiment step by step. The setup is that a distant (point) source illuminates an opaque screen that contains two narrow, parallel slits. A lens is placed after the slits and brings the transmitted light to a focus. In the focal (Fourier) plane of the lens, the angular spectrum of the light becomes the spatial distribution, and we can directly observe the interference pattern.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (a): The Interference Pattern\n\nFor a coherent (point) source, the two slits radiate light that interferes at the focal plane. (If the slits are narrow enough, you may also see the single‐slit diffraction envelope; however, here we emphasize the double‐slit interference.) At a point in the focal plane a lateral displacement x corresponds to an angle given approximately by θ ≈ x/f, where f is the lens focal length. The phase difference between light from the two slits is\n\n  δ = (2π/λ) d sinθ ≈ (2πd/λ)(x/f).\n\nThus the intensity as a function of position is\n\n  I(x) = I₀ cos²(π d x/(λ f))     (assuming equal amplitudes).\n\nA rough sketch of I(x) versus x will show a series of regularly spaced bright (maxima) and dark (minima) fringes with the central maximum at x = 0.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Effect of Moving the Slits Further Apart\n\nIncreasing the distance d between the slits has a direct effect on the fringe spacing. Notice that the spacing between adjacent maxima (or minima) Δx is given by\n\n  Δx = (λ f)/d.\n\nSo if d increases, Δx decreases – meaning the fringes become “closer together” or more tightly spaced. A second graph would show the same oscillatory cosine-squared behavior but with compressed fringe spacing (i.e. more fringes per unit length).\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Effect of a Finite-Sized (Extended) Source\n\nA distant point source gives perfect spatial coherence across the slits. However, if the source has a finite size so that it subtends an angle at the lens, then different parts of the source will have slightly different angles of incidence. In effect, each point on the extended source produces its own fringe pattern that is shifted relative to the others. When these shifted patterns are superposed, the sharp interference fringes become “washed out” (i.e. the fringe visibility or contrast is reduced). A third graph would show that while there is still an underlying fringe structure, its contrast is diminished and in the limit the pattern might just become a smooth envelope rather than distinct bright and dark fringes.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n(a) The interference pattern in the focal plane is a series of evenly spaced bright and dark fringes with intensity given by \n  I(x) ∝ cos²(π d x/(λ f)).  \n(b) If the slits are moved further apart (increasing d), the fringe spacing Δx = (λ f)/d decreases (fringes become closer together).  \n(c) Increasing the size of the source (making it extended) causes a superposition of many slightly shifted fringe patterns, which washes out the contrast, so that the fringes become less pronounced.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & I(x) \\propto \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi d\\, x}{\\lambda f}\\right)\\quad\\text{(a series of regular bright and dark fringes)},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{Increasing } d\\text{ leads to } \\Delta x = \\frac{\\lambda f}{d}\\text{ decreasing, so fringes are more closely spaced},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\text{An extended source produces a superposition of shifted fringe patterns, thereby reducing the fringe contrast (washed out fringes)}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & I(x) \\propto \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi d\\, x}{\\lambda f}\\right)\\quad\\text{(a series of regular bright and dark fringes)},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{Increasing } d\\text{ leads to } \\Delta x = \\frac{\\lambda f}{d}\\text{ decreasing, so fringes are more closely spaced},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\text{An extended source produces a superposition of shifted fringe patterns, thereby reducing the fringe contrast (washed out fringes)}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & I(x) \\propto \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi d\\, x}{\\lambda f}\\right)\\quad\\text{(a series of regular bright and dark fringes)},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{Increasing } d\\text{ leads to } \\Delta x = \\frac{\\lambda f}{d}\\text{ decreasing, so fringes are more closely spaced},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\text{An extended source produces a superposition of shifted fringe patterns, thereby reducing the fringe contrast (washed out fringes)}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\Delta x = \\frac{\\lambda f}{d}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "optics/2-15", "solution": "We start by noting that the glass sheet is a thin film with its two surfaces giving rise to two reflected waves that can interfere. Consider a beam of monochromatic light normally incident on a film (with index n = 1.50 and thickness t = 1.2 × 10⁻⁶ m) in air (n ≈ 1).\n\nStep 1. Determine the phase shifts upon reflection.\n• When light reflects from the first surface (air to glass), it reflects off a medium of higher refractive index. This reflection introduces a phase shift of π (i.e. a half‐wavelength shift).\n• The light that is transmitted into the film then reflects off the second surface (glass to air) because it is going from a higher n to a lower n. This reflection does not introduce any extra phase shift.\n\nStep 2. Calculate the optical path difference.\nThe beam that reflects from the second interface travels an extra distance through the film twice (down and up) so that its extra optical path is 2n t. In terms of phase (with vacuum wavelength λ) this gives an added phase (apart from reflection phase shifts) of\n\n  (2π/λ) (2 n t) = 4π n t/λ.\n\nStep 3.

Because the jitter occurs on a timescale long compared to the optical period but short compared to the detector response time, the detector records an intensity averaged over the distribution of slit spacings.\n\nFor a given slit spacing a, the intensity is\n\n  I(θ; a)= 2I₀ [1 + cos((2πa sinθ)/λ)].\n\nAveraging over the Gaussian distribution of a, the constant term 1 remains unchanged, but the interference term becomes “washed‐out” due to the random phase:\n  ⟨cos((2πa sinθ)/λ)⟩ = cos((2π𝑎̄ sinθ)/λ) exp[–½(2πΔ sinθ/λ)²].\n\nThus, the averaged intensity is\n\n  I_avg(θ)= 2I₀ { 1 + cos((2π𝑎̄ sinθ)/λ) · exp[–(2πΔ sinθ/λ)²/2] }.\n\nNow note the condition Δ ≫ λ. Except for very small θ (where sinθ is so small that the exponential factor is ≈1), even a modest value of θ makes (2πΔ sinθ/λ)≫ 1 so that the exponential, exp[–(2πΔ sinθ/λ)²/2], is strongly suppressed. Thus, for nearly all angles θ the interference (cosine) term is effectively zero. In other words, the fast fluctuation of the slit separation “washes out” the interference fringes.

{"id": "optics/2-78", "solution": "We will show step‐by‐step how one may arrive at an answer. One acceptable answer was to “build” the partially polarized beam as the incoherent sum of a completely “polarized” part (which – though it may be elliptical – can always be written in the form of two orthogonal intensities) and an unpolarized part. (Any answer equivalent to the answers given below is correct.)\n\nIn the following we use I₀ as a “unit” intensity. (Also note that the transmitted intensity through a perfect (loss‐less) polarizer is obtained by projecting the “polarized part” onto the transmission direction and by taking one half of the unpolarized light.)\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Description of the beam before the quarter‐wave plate\n\nSuppose that the incident beam has a total intensity \n  I_total = I_pol + I_u,\nwith a completely polarized part of intensity I_pol and an unpolarized part of intensity I_u. (The “degree of polarization” is then p = I_pol/I_total.)\n\nWhen the beam is sent through a linear polarizer with its transmission axis at an angle θ from the “preferred” direction (to be determined) the transmitted intensity is the sum of the contributions from the polarized and unpolarized parts. In our treatment we write\n\n  I(θ) = (from polarized part) + (from unpolarized part).\n\nIf the polarized part were completely “linear” (that is, of the form E = [a, 0] in some basis) then one would have by Malus’s law for that part\n  I_pol(θ) = I_pol cos²(θ – ψ),\nwhere ψ is the “direction of polarization” of the polarized part. In addition, the unpolarized light always gives a contribution (half its intensity) regardless of the orientation. (That is, an ideal polarizer transmits one–half of the intensity of unpolarized light.) Therefore we write\n\n  I(θ) = I_pol cos²(θ – ψ) + I_u/2.\n                  (1)\n\nNow we are told that when the transmission axis is along x the transmitted intensity is maximum:\n  I(0) = 1.5 I₀.\nAlso, when the transmission axis is along y (i.e. at 90°) the transmitted intensity is minimum:\n  I(90°) = I₀.\n\nSince the maximum is obtained when the polarizer is aligned with the polarization direction of the polarized part, we may take\n\n  ψ = 0.\nThen Eq. (1) becomes\n\n  I(θ) = I_pol cos²θ + I_u/2.\nIn particular,\n  I(0) = I_pol + I_u/2 = 1.5 I₀,  (2)\n  I(90°)= 0 + I_u/2 = I₀.  (3)\n\nFrom (3) we immediately read\n  I_u/2 = I₀  ⟹  I_u = 2 I₀.\nThen (2) gives\n  I_pol = 1.5 I₀ – I_u/2 = 1.5 I₀ – I₀ = 0.5 I₀.\nThus the total intensity is\n  I_total = I_pol + I_u = 0.5 I₀ + 2I₀ = 2.5 I₀.\nIn our picture the polarized part is only 20% of the total (0.5I₀/2.5I₀) and the unpolarized part is 80%. (In what follows we shall see that after the quarter–wave plate the numbers change: the reason will be that the “polarized part” of the beam was not in fact entirely “linear” but rather elliptically polarized.)\n\n────────────────────────────\n(a) Intensity for an Arbitrary Analyzer Angle\n\nEquation (1) now becomes\n\n  I(θ) = I_pol cos²θ + I_u/2.\nUsing the numbers we obtained we have\n\n  I(θ) = 0.5 I₀ cos²θ + I₀.\nThat is, one acceptable answer is\n\n  I(θ) = I₀ + 0.5 I₀ cos²θ.\nIt is important to note that the answer depends only on the extreme intensities: the general result may be written as\n\n  I(θ) = I(90°) + [I(0°) – I(90°)] cos²θ.\nThus the answer does not depend on what the separate values of I_pol and I_u are (i.e. “what fraction is unpolarized”) but only on the measured maximum and minimum.\n  \n────────────────────────────\n(b) After the Quarter–wave Plate\n\nNow the beam is passed through a quarter–wave plate whose fast and slow axes are along x and y. A quarter–wave plate introduces a phase shift of 90° between the x and y components. (Its effect on incoherent unpolarized light is simply to leave its intensity unchanged.)\n\nA key fact is that if the polarized part of the beam were completely linear (say along x) then the QWP would do nothing (because the light is already along one of its axes). However, the clue is that after the quarter–wave plate the maximum transmitted intensity through the polarizer occurs when its axis is at 30° to the x–axis. This tells us that the fully polarized part of the beam was NOT fully “linear” to begin with but was in fact elliptically polarized.\n\nLet the polarized part be described by a Jones vector (up to an overall phase) of the form\n\n  (E_x, E_y) = (a, b e^(iδ)).\nThen the intensity transmitted by a linear polarizer at an angle θ is proportional to\n\n  |a cosθ + b e^(iδ) sinθ|² = a² cos²θ + b² sin²θ + 2ab cosθ sinθ cosδ.\nNow, before the QWP we are told that the maximum intensity occurs for θ = 0 (i.e. along x) and the minimum for θ = 90° (along y). For these to be extrema the cross term must vanish. (A short calculation shows that this forces cosδ = 0, i.e. δ = ±90°.) (Any answer in which one takes δ = ±π/2 is acceptable; here we choose δ = –π/2.) Then before the QWP the polarized part gives\n\n  I_pol(0) = a²  and  I_pol(90°) = b².\nWe already have from part (a) that\n  a² = I(0) – I_u/2 = 1.5I₀ – I₀ = 0.5I₀,\n  b² = I(90°) – I_u/2 = I₀ – I₀ = 0.\nAt first glance one might then think that the light is purely linear along x. But then there would be no change after a quarter–wave plate. The fact that the maximum after the QWP appears at 30° tells us that our assumption in part (a) must be refined. (In many experiments one finds that the beam is “partially elliptically polarized” so that the measured intensities when analysing the beam in the x,y directions are not the full story. In such a case one must allow that even though the transmitted intensities in the x and y directions retain the values 1.5I₀ and I₀, the complex amplitudes must be taken as)\n\n  a² = 1.5 I₀ – I_u/2  and  b² = I(90°)_pol = I₀ – I_u/2,\nwith a² > b².\nIn other words, we write\n  a² = 1.5 I₀ – I_u/2  ,  b² = I₀ – I_u/2.\nBut we already obtained I_u = 2 I₀ if one assumed a fully linear state. To allow a nonzero b we must suppose that the measured analyzer intensities come from an incoherent superposition of a polarized state (of total intensity I_pol) and an unpolarized state (of intensity I_u) with\n\n  I_pol + I_u = 2.5 I₀.\nLet us now denote the “true” values of a² and b² in the polarized part by\n\n  a² = 1.5I₀ – I_u/2  and  b² = I₀ – I_u/2.\nThen one obviously has\n\n  I_pol = a² + b² = (1.5I₀ + I₀) – I_u = 2.5I₀ – I_u.\nThat is, the fraction of polarized light is p = (2.5I₀ – I_u)/(2.5I₀).\n\nNow comes the extra information provided by the QWP and the observation that after the QWP the maximum transmitted intensity (when the polarizer is rotated) occurs when its transmission axis is at 30° to x. A quarter–wave plate with axes along x and y takes the Jones vector (a, b e^(–iπ/2)) into\n  (a, b e^(–iπ/2+ iπ/2)) = (a, b)\nif we choose δ = –π/2. That is, it “undoes” the phase difference so that the previously elliptical beam becomes linearly polarized but not along x in general. In fact, the new linear polarization direction θ₀ is given by\n\n  tan θ₀ = b/a.\nWe are told that the maximum occurs when the analyzer is at 30°; hence\n  tan 30° = 1/√3 = b/a  ⟹  b²/a² = 1/3.\nBut we already know that before the QWP (and thus also after it) the quantities a² and b² are given by\n\n  a² = 1.5I₀ – I_u/2,  b² = I₀ – I_u/2.\nTherefore,\n\n  (I₀ – I_u/2)/(1.5I₀ – I_u/2) = 1/3.\nSolve this equation:\n  3(I₀ – I_u/2) = 1.5I₀ – I_u/2.\nMultiply out:\n  3I₀ – (3/2) I_u = 1.5 I₀ – 0.5 I_u.\nThen, rearrange:\n  3I₀ – 1.5I₀ = (3/2 I_u – 1/2 I_u)  ⟹  1.5I₀ = I_u.\nThus, the unpolarized intensity is\n\n  I_u = 1.5 I₀.\nThen the polarized intensity is\n\n  I_pol = 2.5I₀ – I_u = 2.5I₀ – 1.5I₀ = I₀.\nAnd\n  a² = 1.5I₀ – I_u/2 = 1.5I₀ – 0.75I₀ = 0.75I₀,\n  b² = I₀ – I_u/2 = I₀ – 0.75I₀ = 0.25I₀.\nThus the degree of polarization (i.e. the fraction of the total intensity which is polarized) is\n\n  p = I_pol/(I_pol + I_u) = I₀/(I₀ + 1.5I₀) = 1/2.5 = 0.4,\nor 40% polarized and 60% unpolarized.\n\nAfter the QWP the polarized part becomes linearly polarized along the direction given by\n\n  tan θ₀ = b/a = √0.25/√0.75 = 1/√3,\nso that\n\n  θ₀ = 30°.\nThat is why the maximum transmitted intensity (of the polarized light) now occurs when the analyzer is at 30° to x. When the analyzer is exactly aligned with this new polarization, the polarized part is transmitted completely. Also, the unpolarized part always contributes half of its intensity. Therefore, the maximum transmitted intensity after the QWP is\n\n  I_max = (polarized part) + (half the unpolarized part)\n       = I_pol + I_u/2\n       = I₀ + 1.5I₀/2\n       = I₀ + 0.75I₀\n       = 1.75 I₀.\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) Before any quarter–wave plate the transmitted intensity when the analyzer is at an angle θ from the x–axis is given by\n\n  I(θ) = I(90°) + [I(0°) – I(90°)] cos²θ = I₀ + 0.5I₀ cos²θ.\nThis answer does not depend separately on the fractions of polarized and unpolarized light but only on the measured maximum and minimum.\n\n(b) When the beam is passed through a quarter–wave plate (with its axes along x and y) and then through the linear analyzer, the maximum transmitted intensity (attained when the analyzer is at 30° to x) is\n\n  I_max = 1.75 I₀,\nand the fraction of the incident intensity which is unpolarized is\n\n  I_u/(I_pol+I_u) = 1.5I₀/2.5I₀ = 0.6  (60% unpolarized).\n\nThus, one acceptable final answer is:\n\n  (a) I(θ) = I₀ + 0.5 I₀ cos²θ   (b) I_max = 1.75 I₀  and 60% of the incident intensity is unpolarized.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Boxed Format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad I(\\theta) &= I(90^\\circ) + \\Bigl[I(0^\\circ)-I(90^\\circ)\\Bigr]\\cos^2\\theta \n=\\; I_0+0.5\\,I_0\\cos^2\\theta, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad I_{\\max} &= 1.75\\,I_0,\\quad\\text{and the unpolarized fraction is } \\frac{1.5\\,I_0}{2.5\\,I_0}=0.6.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad I(\\theta) &= I(90^\\circ) + \\Bigl[I(0^\\circ)-I(90^\\circ)\\Bigr]\\cos^2\\theta \n=\\; I_0+0.5\\,I_0\\cos^2\\theta, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad I_{\\max} &= 1.75\\,I_0,\\quad\\text{and the unpolarized fraction is } \\frac{1.5\\,I_0}{2.5\\,I_0}=0.6.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad I(\\theta) &= I(90^\\circ) + \\Bigl[I(0^\\circ)-I(90^\\circ)\\Bigr]\\cos^2\\theta \n=\\; I_0+0.5\\,I_0\\cos^2\\theta, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad I_{\\max} &= 1.75\\,I_0,\\quad\\text{and the unpolarized fraction is } \\frac{1.5\\,I_0}{2.5\\,I_0}=0.6.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "I(\\theta) = 1.5 I_0 \\cos^2 \\theta + I_0 \\sin^2 \\theta"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "optics/2-49", "solution": "We wish to study a three‐slit system where each slit is of width a and the centers of adjacent slits are separated by a distance d. (Thus the left slit is at x = –d, the middle slit at x = 0, and the right slit at x = +d.) In this system the wave passing through the middle slit is passed through a filter which adds a 180° (π radians) phase shift. (The slit widths, however, are small enough so that each slit produces the usual single–slit diffraction envelope.) An incident plane wave (of wavelength λ) strikes the system. We will find:\n\n (a) The angle θ for the first diffraction minimum (i.e. from the single–slit envelope),\n (b) The angle θ for the first interference minimum (the first zero of the interference pattern due to the three slits with the extra π shift in the middle),\n (c) The angle θ for the first interference maximum (i.e. the first bright fringe aside from the central maximum).\n\nLet us analyze each in turn.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (a): First Diffraction Minimum\n\nEach slit (of width a) produces a diffraction envelope given by a well–known condition.

(a) Use of Lenses\n\n• Visible (~5000 Å): In the visible, many glasses and plastics are quite transparent. Their refractive indices differ from unity by of order 0.2–0.5.

To obtain any significant reflection one must work at grazing incidence (light nearly parallel to the surface) or use specially designed multilayer coatings (which use constructive interference effects) to enhance the reflectivity over a narrow band. \n\nThus, for EUV/soft X–ray optics one is forced to use grazing–incidence designs (or special multilayer mirrors) whereas standard mirrors work well in the visible.\n\n───────────────────────────── \n3. (c) Chromatic Resolving Power of Gratings of Fixed Width\n\nRecall that the resolving power of a diffraction grating is given (in the ideal case) by\n  R = λ/Δλ = mN,\nwhere m is the diffraction order and N is the total number of grooves illuminated. For a grating of fixed physical width, one can—in principle—pack many more grooves if the ruling period is very small. However, in practice the design is subject to additional constraints:\n\n• Visible (~5000 Å): In this range, the groove spacings are chosen so that a sufficient number of grooves is illuminated and efficient diffraction in the desired order is obtained. Normal–incidence geometry is available so the entire physical width is used, and high resolving powers can be achieved.\n\n• Short-wavelength (≈100 Å): Although one might favor a very fine ruling to “match” the short wavelength (so that many grooves are present on a given grating width), practical problems arise. The grating must now also be used in a grazing–incidence configuration to achieve any reflection. In such cases the effective “projected” width is reduced; in addition, manufacturing extremely fine and uniform grooves over a large area becomes more challenging. Thus, although in theory one could have a very high resolving power (because many grooves fit in the physical width), in practice the efficiency and the effective number of illuminated grooves are reduced relative to a visible–light grating.\n\nIn summary, while the ideal formula R = mN holds in both cases, the technical implementation (and the effective use of the grating’s width) makes high chromatic resolving power harder to attain at 100 Å than in the visible.\n\n───────────────────────────── \n4. (d) Minimum Resolvable Angular Separation of an Image–Forming System of Fixed Diameter\n\nA diffraction–limited system (for example a telescope) forms images with an angular resolution given roughly by the Rayleigh criterion:\n  θ ~ λ/D,\nwhere D is the effective diameter of the aperture.\n\n• Visible (~5000 Å): For a given aperture, say D, the minimum angular separation that can be resolved is proportional to 5000 Å (≈500 nm).\n\n• Short-wavelength (≈100 Å): With the same aperture the minimum resolvable angle would be roughly 100 Å/ D. Since 100 Å (10 nm) is 50 times smaller than 5000 Å, the diffraction–limit is correspondingly smaller. That is, if one could build perfect optics at 100 Å, a system of fixed diameter would have about 50 times better angular resolution than it would at 5000 Å.\n\nHowever, it must be recalled that making a high–quality imaging system at EUV or soft X–ray wavelengths is extremely challenging (because of the need to work at grazing incidence and the difficulty in fabricating highly polished surfaces), so the theoretically smaller angular size is not always practically achieved.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer\n\nThus, to summarize: \n\n(a) In the visible band refractive lenses are practical because materials have significant refraction and low absorption; at 100 Å there is neither appreciable refraction nor low absorption, so conventional lenses cannot be used.\n\n(b) Whereas mirrors at visible wavelengths may operate at or near normal incidence with high reflectivity, at 100 Å one must use either grazing–incidence mirrors or specialized multilayer mirrors to get any useful reflection.\n\n(c) The ideal grating resolving power (R = mN) is set by the number of grooves illuminated. For a fixed width grating, while finer ruling at 100 Å could in principle yield high resolution, the need for grazing–incidence operation and fabrication difficulties reduce the effective resolving power relative to visible gratings.\n\n(d) Finally, the diffraction–limited angular resolution improves linearly as the wavelength is decreased (θ ~ λ/D), so for an aperture of fixed diameter, a system operating at 100 Å is in principle capable of roughly 50 times better angular resolution than one working at 5000 Å, although in practice the difficulties of EUV optics make this more challenging.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) Lenses: Visible‐optics use refractive lenses because materials are transparent and have } \\\\\n\\quad \\text{substantial refractive indices.

{"id": "optics/2-25", "solution": "The observer’s ability to directly sense interference effects from separated independent pairs of light or sound generators primarily depends on the coherence of the sources and the spatial-temporal overlap of the waves.

{"id": "optics/1-34", "solution": "We start by recalling that an astronomical (or Keplerian) telescope is normally set so that the final rays emerge parallel. This gives a very simple relation between the positions of the two lenses.\n\nStep 1. Converging Eyepiece (Keplerian Telescope)\n\nFor an object at infinity the objective (focal length fₒ) produces a real image at its focal plane (distance fₒ from the objective). In the Keplerian telescope the converging eyepiece (with focal length fₑ) is positioned so that this real image lies at its own focal point. (That is, the distance from the objective to the eyepiece is the sum of the focal lengths.) Thus, the length of the telescope is\n\n  L₍conv₎ = fₒ + fₑ.\n\nThe angular magnification for the telescope is given by\n\n  M = fₒ/fₑ    ⇔  fₑ = fₒ/M.\n\nSo the length becomes\n\n  L₍conv₎ = fₒ + (fₒ/M) = fₒ (1 + 1/M).\n\nStep 2. Diverging Eyepiece (Galilean Telescope)\n\nIn the Galilean telescope, the eyepiece is a diverging lens with focal length –f_d (where f_d > 0 is defined in magnitude). The objective still forms a real image a distance fₒ from it, but now the eyepiece is placed so that its (virtual) focal point coincides with that real image. In this case the separation between the lenses is not fₒ + something but rather\n\n  L₍div₎ = fₒ – f_d,\n\nbecause the negative eyepiece “subtracts” its focal length. The magnification in a Galilean telescope is given (in absolute value) by\n\n  M = fₒ/|f_d| = fₒ/f_d   ⇒  f_d = fₒ/M.\n\nThus, the length of the Galilean telescope becomes\n\n  L₍div₎ = fₒ – (fₒ/M) = fₒ (1 – 1/M).\n\nStep 3. Ratio of the Lengths\n\nWe now have the two lengths expressed as:\n\n  L₍conv₎ = fₒ (1 + 1/M)  and  L₍div₎ = fₒ (1 – 1/M).\n\nTaking the ratio, we get\n\n  L₍conv₎ / L₍div₎ = [1 + 1/M] / [1 – 1/M] = (M + 1) / (M – 1).\n\nThus, for the same magnification M, a telescope with a converging eyepiece (Keplerian telescope) is (M+1)/(M–1) times as long as the one with a diverging eyepiece (Galilean telescope).\n\nStep 4. Why Use the Longer Telescope?\n\nOne might choose the longer Keplerian telescope (with a converging eyepiece) for several reasons. A very important factor is that the converging eyepiece forms a real image, which allows:\n • A wider field of view (important for viewing extended objects).\n • The possibility to place additional optical elements (such as field flatteners or filters) to correct aberrations.\n • Better eye relief in many designs.\nThese benefits often outweigh the disadvantage of a longer tube for many astronomical and terrestrial observing applications.\n\nFinal Answer:\n The ratio of lengths is given by\n\n  L₍conv₎/L₍div₎ = (M + 1)/(M – 1),\n\nand one might choose the longer (Keplerian) telescope because its real image formation allows for a wider field of view and better correction of optical aberrations.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{L_{\\text{Keplerian}}}{L_{\\text{Galilean}}} = \\frac{M+1}{M-1}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\frac{L_{\\text{Keplerian}}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{L_{\\text{Keplerian}}", "expr2": "\\frac{L_K}{L_G} = \\frac{M + 1}{M - 1}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "optics/2-13", "solution": "We begin by recalling that when light is incident normally on a thin film, the two reflected rays (one from the top surface and one from the bottom surface) interfere. Since the light is reflecting off a medium of higher refractive index (air to film, n_air = 1 to n_film = 1.5) at the top, there is a phase shift of π (which is equivalent to half a wavelength). The reflection at the bottom face (film to air) does not incur a phase shift. In order for the two reflected rays to interfere constructively (maximum reflected intensity), the extra phase difference due to the extra optical path length in the film must compensate for this phase inversion.\n\nStep 1. Calculate the optical path difference:\n\nA ray that penetrates the film travels a distance d into the film and d out of the film, for a total physical distance of 2d. But in the film the wavelength is shortened by a factor of n, so the optical path difference is\n\n  2 n d.\n\nStep 2.
