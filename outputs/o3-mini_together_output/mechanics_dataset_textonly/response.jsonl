{"id": "mechanics/3_3", "solution": "We wish to study how the emission and reception of two light‐pulses in one inertial frame S are seen by an observer at rest in a second frame S′ moving with speed v (with β = v/c) along the x‐axis. In S the light source (at x = 0) emits two pulses: one, P₁, at t = 0 and a later one, P₂, at t = τ. An observer in S′ (with coordinates x′ = 0 along his worldline) receives the first pulse at t′ = 0. We shall answer parts (a), (b) and (c) step by step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Arrival Time Interval in S′\n\nBecause the observer in S′ is not at rest in S, the reception times of the two light‐pulses seen in S′ will differ from the emission separation τ. (It is very important to note that the event “emission of P₂” is different from the event “reception of P₂” at the observer’s position.)\n\nLet us use the following method:\n\n1. In S the first pulse P₁ is emitted at (t = 0, x = 0) and it is received by the observer when their worldline crosses that light–cone. We choose the origins so that the reception of P₁ in S′ occurs at (t′ = 0, x′ = 0).\n\n2. In S the second pulse P₂ is emitted at (t = τ, x = 0). Because light travels at speed c and the observer in S is moving along x = vt, the reception event E (the event where the second pulse meets the observer) in S is determined as follows. The light from P₂ propagates as\n  x = c (t – τ),    for t ≥ τ,\nand the observer’s worldline in S is\n  x = vt.\nSetting them equal (i.e. the light catches the observer) we have\n  vt_rec = c (t_rec – τ).\nSolve for the reception time t_rec in S:\n  t_rec (c – v) = cτ ⟹ t_rec = τ·(c/(c – v)) = τ/(1 – β).\n\n3. Now, having the reception event in S with coordinates (t = τ/(1–β), x = vτ/(1–β)), we wish to know the corresponding time in S′. The Lorentz transformation for time is\n  t′ = γ (t – vx/c²),\nwith γ = 1/√(1 – β²). Thus, for the reception of P₂ we have:\n  t′_rec = γ [t_rec – (v/c²)(v t_rec)]\n        = γ t_rec (1 – v²/c²)\n        = γ t_rec (1 – β²).\nBut note that\n  γ (1 – β²) = (1/√(1–β²)) (1 – β²) = √(1 – β²) = 1/γ.\nSo that\n  t′_rec = t_rec/γ = τ/(γ(1 – β)).\n\nSince the first pulse was received at t′ = 0, the time interval (as measured at x′ = 0) between receptions is\n  Δt′ = τ/(γ(1 – β)).\n\nIt is often better to write this result in “symmetric” form. Recall that\n  γ = 1/√(1 – β²),\nso that\n  γ (1 – β) = (1 – β)/√(1–β²) = √((1–β)²/(1–β²))\nwhich leads to the equivalent form\n  Δt′ = τ √((1+β)/(1–β)).\n\nThus, an acceptable answer is:\n\n──────────────────────────────\nAnswer (a):\n  Δt′ = τ √((1 + β)/(1 – β)).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Exact Expression for the Longitudinal Doppler Effect\n\nFrom the result of part (a) the “period” measured in S′, T′, is\n  T′ = Δt′ = τ √((1 + β)/(1 – β)).\nSince the frequency is the inverse period, and if the frequency in S is f = 1/τ then in S′ the frequency is\n  f′ = 1/T′ = f √((1 – β)/(1 + β)).\nBecause the speed of light is constant (c = fλ = f′λ′), the experimentally observed wavelength in S′ will be\n  λ′ = c/f′ = c/(f √((1 – β)/(1 + β))) = λ √((1 + β)/(1 – β)),\nwhere λ = c/f is the wavelength in S.\n\nThus we arrive at the exact Doppler formula for light (the longitudinal Doppler shift):\n\n──────────────────────────────\nAnswer (b):\n  λ′ = λ √((1 + β)/(1 – β)).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Application to Hβ Emission from Accelerated Protons\n\nWe are told that protons are accelerated through a potential V = 20 kV. When they neutralize to form H atoms, they emit the Hβ line (with wavelength λ = 4861.33 Å) while drifting with constant velocity. The optical axis of the spectrometer is parallel to the proton motion so that the Doppler effect is purely longitudinal.\n\n1. First, find the proton speed. A proton of charge q = 1.602×10⁻¹⁹ C gains kinetic energy\n  K = qV.\nUsing V = 20,000 volts, we have:\n  K = 20,000 × 1.602×10⁻¹⁹ J = 3.204×10⁻¹⁵ J.\nThe kinetic energy of a non‐relativistic particle is also given by\n  K = (1/2) m_p v²,\nwith m_p ≈ 1.673×10⁻²⁷ kg. Solving for v:\n  v = √(2K/m_p) = √(2 × 3.204×10⁻¹⁵ J / 1.673×10⁻²⁷ kg).\nLet us compute the argument:\n  2K = 6.408×10⁻¹⁵ J,\n  6.408×10⁻¹⁵ / 1.673×10⁻²⁷ ≈ 3.832×10¹² (m²/s²).\nThus,\n  v ≈ √(3.832×10¹²) ≈ 1.957×10⁶ m/s.\nThen, β is\n  β = v/c ≈ 1.957×10⁶ m/s / 3.0×10⁸ m/s ≈ 0.006523.\nWe may round β ≈ 0.00652.\n\n2. The exact Doppler formula gives\n  λ′ = λ √((1 + β)/(1 – β)).\nWhen β is small, we can expand this to second order in β. Writing the Taylor series for the square-root we have:\n  √((1+β)/(1–β)) = 1 + β + (1/2)β² + O(β³).\nThus, to first order, the fractional wavelength change is\n  (Δλ/λ) ≈ β,\nand including the second–order correction,\n  (Δλ/λ) ≈ β + (1/2)β².\nHence the observed wavelength is approximately\n  λ′ ≈ λ (1 + β + 1/2 β²).\n\n3. Now, plugging in the numbers:\n  β ≈ 0.00652 and (1/2)β² ≈ 0.5 × (0.00652)².\nFirst, (0.00652)² ≈ 4.25×10⁻⁵, so (1/2)β² ≈ 2.125×10⁻⁵.\nThus,\n  λ′ ≈ 4861.33 Å × (1 + 0.00652 + 2.125×10⁻⁵)\n    ≈ 4861.33 Å × (1.00654125).\nMultiplying,\n  Δλ = 4861.33 Å × 0.00654125 ≈ 31.8 Å.\nThus, the shifted wavelength is approximately\n  λ′ ≈ 4861.33 Å + 31.8 Å ≈ 4893.1 Å.\nNotice that to first–order the shift would be about 31.75 Å and the second–order contributes roughly 0.1 Å.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nAnswer (c):\n  To first and second order in β we find \n    λ′ ≈ λ (1 + β + ½ β²).\nFor Hβ (λ = 4861.33 Å) with β ≈ 0.00652, the Doppler–shift is \n    Δλ ≈ 4861.33×(0.00652 + 0.5×(0.00652)²) ≈ 31.8 Å,\nso that\n    λ′ ≈ 4893.1 Å.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers:\n\n(a) Δt′ = τ √((1 + β)/(1 – β)).\n\n(b) λ′ = λ √((1 + β)/(1 – β)).\n\n(c) For Hβ with λ = 4861.33 Å and proton speed corresponding to β ≈ 0.00652:\n    λ′ ≈ λ (1 + β + ½ β²) ≈ 4893.1 Å. \n\nThus, in boxed form we have:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\quad \\Delta t' = \\tau\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b)}\\quad \\lambda' = \\lambda\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(c)}\\quad \\lambda' \\approx \\lambda\\,(1 + \\beta + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\beta^2)\n\\quad\\text{with}\\quad \\beta\\approx 0.00652, \\quad \\lambda' \\approx 4893.1\\,\\text{\\AA}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\quad \\Delta t' = \\tau\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b)}\\quad \\lambda' = \\lambda\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(c)}\\quad \\lambda' \\approx \\lambda\\,(1 + \\beta + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\beta^2)\n\\quad\\text{with}\\quad \\beta\\approx 0.00652, \\quad \\lambda' \\approx 4893.1\\,\\text{\\AA}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\quad \\Delta t' = \\tau\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b)}\\quad \\lambda' = \\lambda\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(c)}\\quad \\lambda' \\approx \\lambda\\,(1 + \\beta + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\beta^2)\n\\quad\\text{with}\\quad \\beta\\approx 0.00652, \\quad \\lambda' \\approx 4893.1\\,\\text{\\AA}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\tau' = \\tau \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + \\beta}{1 - \\beta}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\quad \\Delta t' = \\tau\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b)}\\quad \\lambda' = \\lambda\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(c)}\\quad \\lambda' \\approx \\lambda\\,(1 + \\beta + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\beta^2)\n\\quad\\text{with}\\quad \\beta\\approx 0.00652, \\quad \\lambda' \\approx 4893.1\\,\\text{\\AA}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\lambda' = \\lambda \\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\quad \\Delta t' = \\tau\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b)}\\quad \\lambda' = \\lambda\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(c)}\\quad \\lambda' \\approx \\lambda\\,(1 + \\beta + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\beta^2)\n\\quad\\text{with}\\quad \\beta\\approx 0.00652, \\quad \\lambda' \\approx 4893.1\\,\\text{\\AA}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 31.8 \\, \\text{Å}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\quad \\Delta t' = \\tau\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b)}\\quad \\lambda' = \\lambda\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(c)}\\quad \\lambda' \\approx \\lambda\\,(1 + \\beta + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\beta^2)\n\\quad\\text{with}\\quad \\beta\\approx 0.00652, \\quad \\lambda' \\approx 4893.1\\,\\text{\\AA}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 0.10 \\, \\text{Å}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "mechanics/1_34", "solution": "We wish to analyze a system in which a spaceship “tows” a defective satellite by pulling on one end of a massive (uniform‐density) rope. (Throughout we assume empty space so that no external forces act aside from those generated within the system.) The rope is 50 m long with mass density 1 kg/m so that its mass is 50 kg, while the satellite’s mass is 950 kg. In (a) and (b) the spaceship “tows” the system so that the whole system accelerates at a = 5 m/s². Later in (c) the spaceship “mistakenly” decelerates at 1 m/s²; we will then discuss the consequences.\n\nBecause the rope itself has mass, the force transmitted (i.e. the tension) will not be uniform along its length. It is instructive to “cut” the rope at a variable point and demand that the force (or tension) there be just equal to the net force required to accelerate all the mass that lies “behind” that point (i.e. farther from the spaceship).\n\n────────────────────────────\nPart (a): Force exerted by the spaceship on the rope\n\nWhen the spaceship pulls on the rope it must accelerate both the entire rope and the satellite. That is, the net mass which is being accelerated is\n  m_total = m_satellite + m_rope = 950 kg + 50 kg = 1000 kg.\n\nSince the entire rope and satellite accelerate at 5 m/s², Newton’s second law gives\n\n  F = m_total × a = 1000 kg × 5 m/s² = 5000 N.\n\nThus, the force exerted by the spaceship on the rope is 5000 N.\n\n────────────────────────────\nPart (b): The tension along the rope\n\nBecause the rope is massive, different portions must “contribute” to accelerating the mass behind them. Let us define a coordinate x along the rope in such a way that\n\n  x = 0 at the satellite end,\n  x = L = 50 m at the spaceship end.\n\nAt a distance x from the satellite end, the total mass that lies “behind” that point (i.e. the satellite plus the rope of length x) is\n\n  m(x) = m_satellite + (rope density)×(x) = 950 + 1⋅x = 950 + x (kg).\n\nSince this mass is accelerated at 5 m/s², the tension T(x) just at that point must supply the force\n\n  T(x) = a ⋅ m(x) = 5 (950 + x) (N).\n\nIt is instructive to check the endpoints:\n • At x = 0 (right at the satellite end), the tension is\n  T(0) = 5⋅950 = 4750 N,\n which is just enough to accelerate the satellite.\n • At x = 50 m (the spaceship end), the tension is\n  T(50) = 5 (950 + 50) = 5×1000 = 5000 N,\n which equals the total force applied by the spaceship.\n\nThus, the tension increases linearly along the rope from 4750 N at the satellite to 5000 N at the spaceship.\n\n────────────────────────────\nPart (c): Consequences of the mishap (spaceship deceleration)\n\nNow suppose that, due to a malfunction, the spaceship’s acceleration is suddenly reversed – it now decelerates at 1 m/s². (That is, in the inertial “lab” frame the spaceship now has an acceleration of –1 m/s².) At the moment of the mishap the rope and satellite, which had been accelerating together at 5 m/s², continue with their instantaneous speeds and tendency to accelerate at 5 m/s² (because of their inertia and the fact that the tension distribution does not change “instantaneously” along a massive rope).\n\nWhat happens is essentially as follows:\n\n1. Since the spaceship immediately begins decelerating (accelerating in the direction opposite to its previous motion) with a = –1 m/s², the end of the rope attached to the spaceship will also begin to decelerate. However, the satellite (and the “tails” of the rope further from the spaceship) due to inertia keeps moving with the original acceleration (initially at 5 m/s²).\n\n2. This mismatch means that the rope will no longer be taut uniformly. In fact, because the spaceship “pulls back”, the rope will tend to go slack between the spaceship and the satellite. In the region where the rope slackens the usual linear tension gradient (found when the whole system accelerates uniformly) will disappear temporarily.\n\n3. Once slack develops the satellite and parts of the rope keep moving ahead relative to the decelerating spaceship. Ultimately the slack will be taken up suddenly (as the rope goes taut again by virtue of the satellite’s inertia relative to the suddenly decelerating spaceship). This “snap” can produce a rapid, impulsive force – a tension surge – that may propagate as a shock wave along the rope.\n\n4. Such sudden jerk forces may induce large oscillations (or “whip‐like” motions) in the rope. In a real system these could lead to structural stress in the rope and possibly damage both the rope and the spacecraft’s control systems. Moreover, the defective satellite might experience an abrupt change in acceleration, with potential consequences for its attitude and trajectory.\n\nIn summary, the mishap results in the loss of uniform towing: a deceleration by the spaceship creates a relative motion within the system. Under these circumstances the cable temporarily loses tension (or “goes slack”), and when re‐established the sudden tension pulse may produce oscillations or shocks that could be hazardous. In effect, the uniform acceleration condition is disrupted, and the system (the rope and the towed satellite) is prone to dynamic instabilities until a new equilibrium is achieved.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The force exerted by the spaceship on the rope is\n\n  5000 N.\n\n(b) If we let x (in meters) measure the distance from the satellite end (with x = 0 at the satellite and x = 50 at the spaceship), then the tension along the rope is\n\n  T(x) = 5 (950 + x) N,\n which varies from 4750 N at the satellite end to 5000 N at the spaceship end.\n\n(c) When the spaceship suddenly decelerates at 1 m/s², its end of the rope decelerates while the satellite and far portions of the rope, by inertia, continue their previous motion. The rope will lose its uniform tension (going slack), and when the slack is taken up abruptly a shock (jerk) is produced. This causes oscillations and sudden, potentially hazardous forces on the rope and satellite, risking structural damage, abrupt changes in the satellite’s motion, and overall dynamic instability until a new towing equilibrium can be established.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & F = 5000\\,\\textrm{N},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & T(x) = 5\\,(950 + x)\\,\\textrm{N}\\quad\\text{for } 0 \\le x \\le 50\\ \\textrm{(with }x=0\\text{ at the satellite)},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\text{Deceleration of the spaceship causes the rope to slack as its near end decelerates while}\\\\\n& \\quad \\text{the satellite and far rope continue at the original speed.

Escaping requires that your jump speed v_jump be at least as large as the escape velocity from the asteroid. For a spherical body of radius R and mass M the escape speed is\n\n  v_escape = √(2GM/R).\n\nSince the mass M is related to the density ρ by\n\n  M = (4/3)πR³ρ,\n\nwe can substitute to obtain\n\n  v_escape = √[(2G(4/3)πR³ρ)/R] = √[(8πGρ/3) R²]\n          = R √(8πGρ/3).\n\nStep 2.

Now, let’s examine in turn the qualitative effects of the two given perturbations.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n1. Perturbation (a): Earth’s Polar Flattening (Non‐Central Gravity)\n\n• Because the Earth is not a perfect sphere but rather an oblate spheroid (flattened at the poles), the gravitational potential deviates from the simple 1/r law. The dominant correction is characterized by the “J₂ term” in a spherical harmonic expansion of the Earth's gravity.\n\n• This non-central component produces torques on the orbit. In particular, the perturbation alters the potential energy in such a way that:\n  – The argument of perigee (the orientation of the ellipse within its orbital plane) slowly precesses.\n  – The line of nodes (the intersection of the orbital plane with the Earth’s equatorial plane) also precesses; for most orbits, the nodes regress (move opposite to the orbital motion).\n\n• Because these are long‐term averaged (secular) effects, the shape of the ellipse (i.e., the eccentricity) and the semimajor axis remain essentially unchanged. What is altered is the orientation of the orbit in space.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n2. Perturbation (b): Concentrated Atmospheric Drag near Perigee\n\n• Atmospheric drag is a non-conservative force that extracts energy and angular momentum from the satellite. Because the atmospheric density decays rapidly with altitude, the drag is most significant at the perigee where the satellite is closest to Earth.\n\n• The impulsive drag at perigee reduces the orbital energy more severely there. Although the change in velocity may be sudden, the overall effect is that:\n  – The semimajor axis decreases (the orbit “shrinks”).\n  – The loss of energy—with an associated change in angular momentum—tends to reduce the eccentricity, i.e. the orbit gradually becomes more circular.\n  – The effect on orbit orientation is generally minor compared to the energy loss; rather, the primary modification is in the size and shape of the orbit.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Summary\n\n(a) The oblateness of the Earth (polar flattening) leads to a non-central gravitational force that does not change the energy but causes the orbit’s orientation to precess (the line of nodes and the argument of perigee rotate slowly).\n\n(b) Atmospheric drag, occurring primarily at perigee, lowers the satellite’s orbital energy and angular momentum—resulting in a decreasing semimajor axis and a reduction in eccentricity (making the orbit more circular over time).\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) The Earth’s polar flattening (J₂ effect) produces torques that cause the orbital}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{ellipse to precess, changing the orientation (both the line of nodes and the argument}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{of perigee) without significantly affecting the semimajor axis or eccentricity.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) Atmospheric drag, concentrated near perigee, dissipates orbital energy and angular}\\\\\n\\quad \\text{momentum, reducing the semimajor axis and eccentricity.

In all cases we assume that only the Sun’s gravity matters (the planets’ fields can be neglected) and that the spacecraft meets Mars if it is launched at the proper time.\n\nBefore giving our answers, let us define\n\n  a = (R_E + R_M) / 2     (the semi‐major axis of the transfer orbit).\n\nRemember that in any central force (Kepler) orbit the speed at radius r is given by\n\n  v = √[ μ (2/r – 1/a) ].\n\nAlso, the speed on a circular orbit of radius R is\n\n  v_circ = √(μ/R).\n\nWe now proceed part by part.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (a): What velocity (relative to Earth) and in what direction must Mariner 4 have when leaving Earth?\n\nWhen Mariner 4 leaves Earth it instantaneously “joins” an orbit about the Sun. Since Earth is already moving with speed\n\n  v_E = √(μ/R_E)\n \naround the Sun, the spacecraft must be given an extra heliocentric velocity so that its speed (at r = R_E) becomes\n\n  v_p = √[ μ (2/R_E – 1/a) ]    (speed at perihelion of the ellipse).\n\nThus, compared to Earth the spacecraft must be given a “boost” equal to\n\n  Δv = v_p – v_E.\n\nIt is easy to simplify this expression a little bit. Note that\n\n  v_p = √[ μ (2/R_E – 2/(R_E+R_M)) ]\n     = √[2μ (1/R_E – 1/(R_E+R_M)) ]\n     = √(μ/R_E) √[2(1 – (R_E/(R_E+R_M)))]\n     = √(μ/R_E) √(2R_M/(R_E+R_M)).\n\nThus the needed velocity “excess” relative to Earth is\n\n  Δv = √(μ/R_E) [√(2R_M/(R_E+R_M)) – 1].\n\nThe direction of the boost should be along Earth’s instantaneous orbital velocity (i.e. tangential to the circular orbit) so that the heliocentric velocity v_p is in the same direction as v_E (only its magnitude is increased). In other words, Mariner 4 must leave Earth “in the direction of Earth’s motion.”\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (b): How long will it take to reach Mars?\n\nThe transfer orbit is an ellipse of semi‐major axis a. The period of an ellipse is\n\n  T = 2π √(a³/μ).\n\nSince the transfer is from perihelion (Earth’s orbit) to aphelion (Mars’ orbit) – one half of a complete orbit – the time of flight is\n\n  t = T/2 = π √(a³/μ).\n\nWe can substitute back a = (R_E+R_M)/2 to obtain\n\n  t = π √[ ((R_E+R_M)/2)³ / μ ]\n    = π √[ (R_E+R_M)³/(8μ) ].\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (c): With what velocity, relative to Mars, will it reach the orbit of Mars?\n\nAt aphelion, the heliocentric speed of the spacecraft is\n\n  v_a = √[ μ (2/R_M – 1/a) ].\n\nLet us write this in a form similar to part (a). Since\n\n  v_a = √[ μ (2/R_M – 2/(R_E+R_M)) ]\n     = √(2μ (1/R_M – 1/(R_E+R_M)))\n     = √(μ/R_M) √[2 (1 – (R_M/(R_E+R_M)))]\n     = √(μ/R_M) √(2R_E/(R_E+R_M)).\n\nOn the other hand, Mars’s circular orbital speed is\n\n  v_M = √(μ/R_M).\n\nSince the transfer ellipse is tangent to Mars’s circular orbit at aphelion (but with v_a < v_M), the velocity of Mariner 4 relative to Mars is\n\n  Δv_M = v_M – v_a\n    = √(μ/R_M) [1 – √(2R_E/(R_E+R_M))].\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\nThus, one acceptable answer is as follows:\n\n  (a) The spacecraft must be launched relative to Earth with speed\n    Δv = √(μ/R_E) [√(2R_M/(R_E+R_M)) – 1],\n    in the direction tangent to Earth’s orbit (i.e. in the direction of Earth’s orbital motion).\n\n  (b) The time of flight is\n    t = π √[((R_E + R_M)/2)³/μ] = π √[(R_E+R_M)³/(8μ)].\n\n  (c) Upon reaching Mars, the spacecraft’s speed relative to Mars (in the heliocentric frame) is less than Mars’s orbital speed by\n    Δv_M = √(μ/R_M) [1 – √(2R_E/(R_E+R_M))].\n\nWe now provide these answers in the boxed format.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX boxed format:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} \\quad \\Delta v &= \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{R_E}}\\Biggl(\\sqrt{\\frac{2R_M}{R_E+R_M}}-1\\Biggr), \\quad\\text{directed tangentially (in the direction of Earth's motion).} \\\\\n\\\\\n\\text{(b)} \\quad t &= \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Bigl(\\frac{R_E+R_M}{2}\\Bigr)^3}{\\mu}}=\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{(R_E+R_M)^3}{8\\mu}}, \\\\\n\\\\\n\\text{(c)} \\quad \\Delta v_M &= \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{R_M}}\\Biggl(1-\\sqrt{\\frac{2R_E}{R_E+R_M}}\\Biggr).\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} \\quad \\Delta v &= \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{R_E}}\\Biggl(\\sqrt{\\frac{2R_M}{R_E+R_M}}-1\\Biggr), \\quad\\text{directed tangentially (in the direction of Earth's motion).} \\\\\n\\\\\n\\text{(b)} \\quad t &= \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Bigl(\\frac{R_E+R_M}{2}\\Bigr)^3}{\\mu}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} \\quad \\Delta v &= \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{R_E}}\\Biggl(\\sqrt{\\frac{2R_M}{R_E+R_M}}-1\\Biggr), \\quad\\text{directed tangentially (in the direction of Earth's motion).} \\\\\n\\\\\n\\text{(b)} \\quad t &= \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Bigl(\\frac{R_E+R_M}{2}\\Bigr)^3}{\\mu}", "expr2": "v_r = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GMR_M}{R_E(R_M + R_E)}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R_E}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "mechanics/1_51", "solution": "We wish to understand what happens if an electron initially in a circular orbit about a “tritium nucleus” (with effective charge +1) suddenly “sees” a nucleus whose charge has increased to +2. (In our model an electron is orbiting a point‐charge nucleus in a Coulomb potential.) Because the change is sudden the electron’s position and velocity are unchanged at that instant. (It is only the potential that changes.) However, the force acting on it is now that due to a nucleus of charge +2. (For simplicity we use “ke²” to denote the Coulomb constant times the product of charges; you may take k = 1/4πε₀ if desired.)\n\nLet us denote the radius of the original circular orbit by r₀.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. The “Before” Situation\n\nIn the original Coulomb field (charge +1), a circular orbit is obtained when the centripetal force equals the Coulomb attraction:\n  m v₀²/r₀ = ke²/r₀²     (1)\nso that\n  v₀² = ke²/(m r₀).\n\nFor a circular orbit the kinetic and potential energies are\n  T = ½ m v₀² = ½ (ke²/r₀)\n  U = –ke²/r₀.\nThus the total energy is\n  E_i = T + U = (ke²/(2r₀)) – (ke²/r₀) = – ke²/(2r₀).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. The “After” Situation Immediately\n\nWhen the nucleus suddenly changes its charge from +1 to +2 the electron’s instantaneous state (its r and v) remain the same. Therefore the kinetic energy is still\n  T = ½ m v₀² = ke²/(2r₀)\n(because v₀² has not changed). However, its potential energy is now\n  U' = – (2 ke²)/r₀.\nThus the new total energy is\n  E_f = T + U' = (ke²/(2r₀)) – (2 ke²/r₀) = – (3 ke²)/(2r₀).\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(a) Ratio of the electron’s energy after to that before emission\n\nWe take our zero of energy as usual (0 when the electron is free, with zero kinetic energy). Then\n  E_i = – ke²/(2r₀)  and  E_f = – (3 ke²)/(2r₀).\n\nThus the ratio is\n  E_f/E_i = [ – (3 ke²)/(2r₀) ] / [ – ke²/(2r₀) ] = 3.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(b) Qualitative Description of the New Orbit\n\nEven though the electron’s position and speed do not change at the moment of the “jump”, the change in potential (doubling the attractive force) means that the velocity is not the circular one for the new (more tightly binding) potential. In fact, for a Coulomb potential with charge +2 a circular orbit of radius r would require\n  m v_c²/r = (2 ke²)/r² → v_c² = 2ke²/(m r),\nwhich is larger than the original v₀² = ke²/(m r₀) if r = r₀. Consequently the electron is “too slow” to remain in a circular orbit about the now stronger +2 nucleus. It instead finds itself in an elliptical orbit. A detailed analysis (below) shows that the electron’s position at the moment the potential is changed is an extremum of its radial coordinate – in fact it turns out to be the aphelion (greatest distance) of the new ellipse.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(c) Finding the Distance of Closest and Farthest Approach\n\nFor a particle moving in a Coulomb (central–force) potential the orbit is a conic section. Its general equation in polar coordinates is\n\n  r(θ) = p/(1 + e cosθ),\n     (2)\n\nwhere\n  p = (L²)/(m (2 ke²))    [since the nucleus now has charge 2].\n\nThe angular momentum L is conserved. Initially we had a circular orbit with \n  L = m v₀ r₀.\nWe have already found v₀² = ke²/(m r₀) so that\n  L² = m² v₀² r₀² = m² (ke²/(m r₀)) r₀² = m ke² r₀.\nThus the semilatus rectum is\n\n  p = L²/[m (2 ke²)] = [m ke² r₀] / [m (2 ke²)] = r₀/2.\n\nNext, the orbit’s eccentricity e is determined by\n\n  e = √[1 + (2 E_f L²)/(m (2 ke²)²)].\nLet us substitute E_f = – (3 ke²)/(2r₀) and L² = m ke² r₀:\n  2 E_f L² = 2 * (– (3 ke²)/(2r₀)) * (m ke² r₀) = – 3 m k² e⁴? \nLet’s compute step‐by‐step:\n\nStep (i): Multiply numerator: 2 E_f L² = 2 (–3 ke²/(2r₀)) (m ke² r₀) = – 3 m k² e⁴? \nIt is best to keep the factors straight:\n  2 E_f L² = –3 m (ke²)².\nThe denominator is:\n  m (2 ke²)² = m (4 k² e^4).\nThus\n  (2 E_f L²)/(m (2 ke²)²) = (– 3 m k² e^4)/(4 m k² e^4) = – 3/4.\nThen\n  e = √(1 – 3/4) = √(1/4) = 1/2.\n\nRemember that the radial turning points (perihelium and aphelium) occur when 1 + e cosθ = 0, i.e., when the denominator is minimized or maximized. In fact, the minimum and maximum radii are given by\n  r_min = p/(1 + e) and r_max = p/(1 – e).\nWe already found p = r₀/2 and e = 1/2, so\n  r_min = (r₀/2)/(1 + 1/2) = (r₀/2)/(3/2) = r₀/3,\n  r_max = (r₀/2)/(1 – 1/2) = (r₀/2)/(1/2) = r₀.\n\nThus the electron is at its farthest distance (aphelion) r₀ at the moment of the leap, and its closest approach is r₀/3.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(d) Major and Minor Axes of the Elliptical Orbit\n\nFor any ellipse we have\n  semimajor axis a = (r_min + r_max)/2.\nThus,\n  a = (r₀/3 + r₀)/2 = (4r₀/3)/2 = 2r₀/3.\n\nThe eccentricity is e = (r_max – r_min)/(r_max + r_min). (One may verify that with r_max = r₀ and r_min = r₀/3 one obtains e = 1/2, as above.)\n\nThe semiminor axis b is given in terms of a and e by\n  b = a √(1 – e²) = (2r₀/3) √(1 – 1/4) = (2r₀/3) √(3/4) = (r₀ √3)/3.\n\nThus the full (linear) lengths are:\n  Major axis length = 2a = 4r₀/3,\n  Minor axis length = 2b = 2r₀√3/3.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The ratio of the electron's final to initial energy is  \n  E_f/E_i = 3.\n\n(b) The electron, which finds itself with the same speed and position but in a potential twice as strong, now follows an elliptical orbit. Moreover, since the electron was at r₀ when the change occurred and that happens to be an extreme (the farthest point) for the new orbit, the electron is at the aphelion of its ellipse.\n\n(c) The distances of closest and farthest approach are:\n  r_min = r₀/3 and r_max = r₀.\n\n(d) For the ellipse, the semimajor axis is a = 2r₀/3 (so the major axis is 4r₀/3) and the semiminor axis is b = (r₀√3)/3.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Boxed Format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\quad \\frac{E_f}{E_i} = 3,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b)}\\quad \\text{The electron now moves on an ellipse, with its initial position (at }r_0\\text{) being the aphelion (largest distance).}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(c)}\\quad r_{\\min} = \\frac{r_0}{3},\\quad r_{\\max} = r_0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(d)}\\quad \\text{Semimajor axis }a = \\frac{2r_0}{3},\\quad \\text{Semiminor axis }b = \\frac{r_0\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\quad \\frac{E_f}{E_i} = 3,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b)}\\quad \\text{The electron now moves on an ellipse, with its initial position (at }r_0\\text{) being the aphelion (largest distance).}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(c)}\\quad r_{\\min} = \\frac{r_0}{3},\\quad r_{\\max} = r_0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(d)}\\quad \\text{Semimajor axis }a = \\frac{2r_0}{3},\\quad \\text{Semiminor axis }b = \\frac{r_0\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\quad \\frac{E_f}{E_i} = 3,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b)}\\quad \\text{The electron now moves on an ellipse, with its initial position (at }r_0\\text{) being the aphelion (largest distance).}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(c)}\\quad r_{\\min} = \\frac{r_0}{3},\\quad r_{\\max} = r_0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(d)}\\quad \\text{Semimajor axis }a = \\frac{2r_0}{3},\\quad \\text{Semiminor axis }b = \\frac{r_0\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "3"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\quad \\frac{E_f}{E_i} = 3,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b)}\\quad \\text{The electron now moves on an ellipse, with its initial position (at }r_0\\text{) being the aphelion (largest distance).}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(c)}\\quad r_{\\min} = \\frac{r_0}{3},\\quad r_{\\max} = r_0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(d)}\\quad \\text{Semimajor axis }a = \\frac{2r_0}{3},\\quad \\text{Semiminor axis }b = \\frac{r_0\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{1}{3} \\, r_0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

We will expand the equations (1) and (2) to first order in x and θ.\n\nRecall: when θ is small, we may use:\n  cosθ ≈ 1, sinθ ≈ θ,\nand we neglect terms that are quadratic (or higher) in the small quantities (x, θ and their time derivatives).\n\n— Radial Equation —\n\nStarting from (1):\n  m d²r/dt² – m r (dot{θ})² + k (r – l) – m g cosθ = 0.\nReplace r = r₀ + x and note that d²r/dt² = d²x/dt².\n\nThe term – m r (dot{θ})² is quadratic (both dot{θ} and small displacements are small) and may be dropped. Also, using cosθ ≈ 1, we have:\n  m d²x/dt² + k ((r₀ + x) – l) – m g = 0.\nBut notice that (r₀ – l) = (m g)/k by the equilibrium condition. Therefore,\n  k ((r₀ – l) + x) – m g = k (m g/k + x) – m g = m g + k x – m g = k x.\nThus the r–equation (to linear order) becomes\n  m d²x/dt² + k x = 0,\nor\n  d²x/dt² + (k/m)x = 0.\n\n— Angular Equation —\n\nFor (2) we have\n  d/dt (m r² dot{θ}) + m g r sinθ = 0.\nSubstitute r = r₀ + x. To first order we approximate r² ≈ r₀² (since the product of a small quantity and another small quantity is of second order) and r ≈ r₀ in the gravitational term. Thus, we get\n  m r₀² d²θ/dt² + m g r₀ θ = 0,\nwhich is equivalent to\n  d²θ/dt² + (g / r₀) θ = 0.\nRecall that r₀ = l + (mg)/k, so the angular frequency is √(g/r₀).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 5.

(Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) We now explain step‐by–step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Finding k such that a point fixed in the turntable is an equilibrium\n\nSuppose the body is “at rest with respect to the turntable” even though the entire turntable rotates (with constant angular velocity ω about the z–axis). (That is, in the lab frame the particle makes a circle while its “r–coordinate” on the turntable remains fixed.) In that case the particle’s lab–frame coordinate is\n  x(t)= (x(t),y(t)) = R (cos(ωt+φ), sin(ωt+φ))\nwith constant radius R and some constant phase φ.\n\nIts lab–frame velocity is \n  ẋ(t)= ω×x(t)    [since differentiating a rotation gives the “centripetal” term]. \n\nAlso, since the particle is “fixed on the turntable” we have\n  ẋ – v = ẋ – (ω×x) = 0,\nso the friction force is zero. But the elastic force is still present. Its value in the lab frame is\n  F_spring = – k x(t).\nOn the other hand, since the particle’s lab–frame acceleration is \n  ẍ(t)= –ω^2 x(t)   (centripetal acceleration),\nNewton’s law tells us that\n  m ẍ = –k x.\nThus we must have\n  –mω^2 x = –k x,\nor, for nonzero x,\n  k = mω^2.\nThat is our answer for part (a).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Solving for the velocity ẋ(t), i.e. for v(t)=ẋ(t)\n\nWith k = mω^2 the equation of motion is\n  m ẍ = –mω^2 x – c (ẋ – ω×x).\n\nIt is extremely convenient to define the “relative velocity”\n  u(t) := ẋ(t) – ω×x(t).\n(Notice that u is exactly the velocity “relative to the turntable”.)\n\nThen the equation of motion becomes\n  m ẍ = –mω^2 x – c u.\nBut we can also “differentiate” the definition of u. Since\n  u = ẋ – ω×x,\nits time derivative is\n  u̇ = ẍ – ω×ẋ.\nA short calculation (using ẋ = u + ω×x) shows that the acceleration ẍ may be eliminated; indeed, one obtains\n  u̇ = – (c/m) u – ω× u.\nThat is a linear first–order ODE for u. Its solution is\n  u(t) = e^{-(c/m)t} R(-ωt) u(0),\nwhere R(θ) is the usual 2×2 rotation matrix (rotating vectors in the plane by an angle θ) and \n  u(0) = ẋ(0) – ω×x(0).\nNow, since by definition ẋ = u + ω×x, we may therefore write the velocity as\n  ẋ(t) = ω×x(t) + e^{-(c/m)t} R(-ωt)[ẋ(0) – ω×x(0)].\nThis is a complete answer for part (b) in terms of the initial conditions.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Solving for the position x(t)\n\nSince u(t) = ẋ(t) – ω×x(t) and we now know u(t), we can “integrate” to find x(t). Write\n  ẋ(t) = ω×x(t) + u(t)   with  u(t)= e^{-(c/m)t} R(-ωt)[ẋ(0) – ω×x(0)].\nIt is very natural now to “undo” the rotation. In fact, one acceptable answer is to write the solution in the “rotating coordinates” by first writing\n  x(t) = R(ωt)X(t)\nwith X(t) a vector in the (nonrotating) frame attached to the turntable. It turns out that one may show (by a short calculation) that\n  X(t) = X(0) + ∫₀ᵗ e^{-(c/m)s}R(-ωs)[ẋ(0) – ω×x(0)] ds,\nso that the lab–frame solution is\n  x(t) = R(ωt) [x(0) + ∫₀ᵗ e^{-(c/m)s} R(-ωs)[ẋ(0) – ω×x(0)] ds ].\nThus the general solution for x(t) is given in closed–form by the formula above.\n\nIn words the answer is as follows: The particle’s initial velocity (or, more precisely, its velocity relative to the turntable) decays exponentially at the rate c/m while also “rotating away” with the turntable. Consequently, regardless of its initial conditions it eventually moves with the turntable. (In particular, if it starts at rest in the lab frame it will first be “picked up” and then eventually co–rotate with the table.) A sketch of the motion would show an exponential spiral that converges to a circle.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) To have a fixed point (with respect to the turntable) as a solution we require\n  k = m ω².\n\n(b) Defining \n  u(t) = ẋ(t) – ω×x(t)  with  u(0)= ẋ(0) – ω×x(0),\nthe solution for the velocity is\n  ẋ(t) = ω×x(t) + e^{-(c/m)t} R(-ωt)[ẋ(0) – ω×x(0)].\n\n(c) An acceptable answer for the position is\n  x(t) = R(ωt) [ x(0) + ∫₀ᵗ e^{-(c/m)s} R(-ωs)[ẋ(0) – ω×x(0)] ds ].\nThat is, the particle’s motion is given by a circular rotation (with angular speed ω) of its initial position combined with an exponentially decaying transient (proportional to the initial relative velocity). In words, the particle “spirals” from its initial state to eventually follow the turntable in perfect circular motion.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal boxed answers\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & k = m\\omega^2,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t)=\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(t)+e^{-\\tfrac{c}{m}t}\\,R(-\\omega t)\\Bigl[\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(0)-\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(0)\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\mathbf{x}(t)=R(\\omega t)\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}(0)+\\int_{0}^{t}e^{-\\tfrac{c}{m}s}\\,R(-\\omega s)\\Bigl[\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(0)-\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(0)\\Bigr]\\,ds\\right\\}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nAny answer equivalent to the above is correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & k = m\\omega^2,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t)=\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(t)+e^{-\\tfrac{c}{m}t}\\,R(-\\omega t)\\Bigl[\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(0)-\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(0)\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\mathbf{x}(t)=R(\\omega t)\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}(0)+\\int_{0}^{t}e^{-\\tfrac{c}{m}s}\\,R(-\\omega s)\\Bigl[\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(0)-\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(0)\\Bigr]\\,ds\\right\\"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & k = m\\omega^2,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t)=\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(t)+e^{-\\tfrac{c}{m}t}\\,R(-\\omega t)\\Bigl[\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(0)-\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(0)\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\mathbf{x}(t)=R(\\omega t)\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}(0)+\\int_{0}^{t}e^{-\\tfrac{c}{m}s}\\,R(-\\omega s)\\Bigl[\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(0)-\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(0)\\Bigr]\\,ds\\right\\", "expr2": "k = m\\omega^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & k = m\\omega^2,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t)=\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(t)+e^{-\\tfrac{c}{m}t}\\,R(-\\omega t)\\Bigl[\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(0)-\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(0)\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\mathbf{x}(t)=R(\\omega t)\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}(0)+\\int_{0}^{t}e^{-\\tfrac{c}{m}s}\\,R(-\\omega s)\\Bigl[\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(0)-\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(0)\\Bigr]\\,ds\\right\\", "expr2": "\\dot{x} = [\\dot{x}_0 \\cos(2\\omega t) + \\dot{y}_0 \\sin(2\\omega t)]e^{-ct/m}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & k = m\\omega^2,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t)=\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(t)+e^{-\\tfrac{c}{m}t}\\,R(-\\omega t)\\Bigl[\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(0)-\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(0)\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\mathbf{x}(t)=R(\\omega t)\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}(0)+\\int_{0}^{t}e^{-\\tfrac{c}{m}s}\\,R(-\\omega s)\\Bigl[\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(0)-\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(0)\\Bigr]\\,ds\\right\\", "expr2": "\\dot{y} = [-\\dot{x}_0 \\sin(2\\omega t) + \\dot{y}_0 \\cos(2\\omega t)]e^{-ct/m}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & k = m\\omega^2,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t)=\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(t)+e^{-\\tfrac{c}{m}t}\\,R(-\\omega t)\\Bigl[\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(0)-\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(0)\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\mathbf{x}(t)=R(\\omega t)\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}(0)+\\int_{0}^{t}e^{-\\tfrac{c}{m}s}\\,R(-\\omega s)\\Bigl[\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(0)-\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(0)\\Bigr]\\,ds\\right\\", "expr2": "x = x_0 + \\frac{m(c\\dot{x}_0 + 2m\\omega \\dot{y_0})}{c^2 + 4m^2\\omega^2} - \\left[ \\frac{m(\\dot{x}_0 + 2m\\omega \\dot{y_0})}{c^2 + 4m^2\\omega^2} \\cos(2\\omega t) - \\frac{m(2m\\omega \\dot{x}_0 - c\\dot{y}_0)}{c^2 + 4m^2\\omega^2} \\sin(2\\omega t) \\right] e^{-ct/m}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & k = m\\omega^2,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t)=\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(t)+e^{-\\tfrac{c}{m}t}\\,R(-\\omega t)\\Bigl[\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(0)-\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(0)\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\mathbf{x}(t)=R(\\omega t)\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}(0)+\\int_{0}^{t}e^{-\\tfrac{c}{m}s}\\,R(-\\omega s)\\Bigl[\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(0)-\\omega\\times\\mathbf{x}(0)\\Bigr]\\,ds\\right\\", "expr2": "y = y_0 - \\frac{m(2m\\omega \\dot{x}_0 - c\\dot{y}_0)}{c^2 + 4m^2\\omega^2} + \\left[ \\frac{m(2m\\omega \\dot{x}_0 - c\\dot{y}_0)}{c^2 + 4m^2\\omega^2} \\cos(2\\omega t) + \\frac{m(c\\dot{x}_0 + 2m\\omega \\dot{y_0})}{c^2 + 4m^2\\omega^2} \\sin(2\\omega t) \\right] e^{-ct/m}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Because the table is frictionless no external impulse is transmitted to the other rod; however, the “internal impulse” transmitted at the hinge is such that the instantaneous velocities of B (as computed from the motion of rod AB and of rod BC) must agree.\n\nOne may show (by carefully writing the impulse–momentum equations for each rod about its centre–of–mass and then imposing that the velocity vB of the common point B be unique) that the answers come out as\n\n • For rod AB (with centre–of–mass at M₁ = (–a/2,0)) the centre–of–mass obtains\n  V₁ = (0, (P + J_y)/m)\n and its spin rate about M₁ is\n  ω₁ = 6(J_y – P)/(m a)\n while for rod BC (with centre–of–mass at M₂ = (a/2,0)) the only impulse is that from the hinge giving\n  V₂ = (0, –J_y/m)\n and its spin is\n  ω₂ = 6J_y/(m a).\n\nThe additional condition is that the velocity of the hinge B must be the same when computed “from” the two rods. Writing the velocity of B (which, for a given rod is the velocity of its centre–of–mass plus the contribution from rotation about the centre–of–mass) one may show that the matching condition forces\n  J_y = P/4.\nThen a short bit of algebra gives\n\n  V₁ = (0, (P+P/4)/m) = (0, 5P/(4m))  and  V₂ = (0, –P/(4m)).\n\nNow, since in rod AB the end–A (with A – M₁ = (–a/2,0)) gets the extra rotational “kick”\n  v₍rot₎(A) = –ω₁ (a/2)      (the minus sign is a matter of our chosen sign convention)\nwe deduce that\n  v_A = V₁ + (0, –ω₁ a/2).\nIn exactly the same way, one finds for the hinge point B\n  v_B = V₁ + (0, ω₁ a/2)    (as computed from rod AB)\nor, equivalently, \n  v_B = V₂ – (0, ω₂ a/2)    (as computed from rod BC).\nOne may then verify that\n  v_B = (0, –P/m).\nAlso, the rates of spin come out as\n  ω₁ = –9P/(2m a)   and  ω₂ = 3P/(2m a),\nwhere the negative value of ω₁ indicates that rod AB rotates clockwise while rod BC rotates counterclockwise.\n\nFinally, one may also check that the velocity for the free–end A (which gets the full effect of the impulse) is\n  v_A = (0, 7P/(2m))\nand that the free–end C acquires\n  v_C = (0, P/(2m)).\n\nThus, immediately after the impulse the three points have the following velocities:\n  • A moves upward with speed 7P⁄(2m),\n  • B moves downward with speed P⁄m (that is, v_B = –P/m in our y–axis convention) \n  • C moves upward with speed P⁄(2m),\nand the two rods acquire “spin” about their centres–of–mass given by\n  ω₍AB₎ = –9P⁄(2m a)  and  ω₍BC₎ =  3P⁄(2m a).\n\nAny answer equivalent to the following boxed answer is correct.\n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nFinal Answer in Latex:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nv_A &=& \\dfrac{7P}{2m}\\,\\hat{j},\\\\[1mm]\nv_B &=& -\\dfrac{P}{m}\\,\\hat{j},\\\\[1mm]\nv_C &=& \\dfrac{P}{2m}\\,\\hat{j},\\\\[2mm]\n\\omega_{AB} &=& -\\dfrac{9P}{2ma}\\quad\\text{(clockwise)},\\\\[1mm]\n\\omega_{BC} &=& \\dfrac{3P}{2ma}\\quad\\text{(counterclockwise)}.\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\nExplanation summary:\n\n1. Total linear momentum (of mass 2m) must equal (0,P) so that the centre–of–mass acquires speed P/(2m).\n2. Since the impulse is applied at A (a distance a from B) it produces an angular impulse about B equal to aP.\n3. Writing the impulse–momentum equations for each rod (about their centres–of–mass) and then imposing that the velocity of the common hinge B be unique determines the unknown impulse transmitted by the hinge (here, its y–component turns out to be P/4).\n4. One then finds that rod AB (which “received” the impulse at A) ends up with centre–of–mass speed 5P⁄(4m) and an extra rotation (spin) ω₁ = –9P⁄(2ma) so that its end A moves with speed 7P⁄(2m) while end B moves with speed –P/m.\n5.

{"id": "mechanics/3_5", "solution": "We will show step‐by‐step that\n\n(1) The combination (c𝑘, ω) transforms under a Lorentz transformation exactly as any other 4–vector does, and\n\n(2) Using this fact we can derive the relativistic Doppler formulas for light emitted from an atom (with rest–frequency ω₀) when the atom is moving with speed v (with β = v/c) toward or away from the observer.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Showing that (c𝑘, ω) is a relativistic 4–vector\n\nAny electromagnetic wave may be characterized by a phase\n  φ = k · r – ωt.\nOne of the postulates of special relativity is that the phase of a wave is invariant under a Lorentz transformation. (That is, the phase measured in one inertial frame is the same as that measured in another.)\n\nNow write the phase in a manifestly “4–vector” form. Introduce the 4–position\n  x^μ = (r, ct).\nThen we can define a 4–wavevector as\n  k^μ = (𝑘, ω/c)\nso that the phase becomes\n  φ = k · r – ωt = k^μ x_μ    (using a suitable metric in which time appears with the factor c).\nOften, one prefers to write the time–component “up” and include a factor of c with the spatial components. Equivalently, one may write\n  (c𝑘, ω)\nwhich is just a rescaling of the components. In any event, the point is that the phase, being a scalar (invariant), is constructed in terms of the inner product of two 4–vectors. Hence, since x^μ is a 4–vector and the phase is invariant, the quantity (c𝑘, ω) (or, equivalently, k^μ = (𝑘, ω/c)) necessarily must transform as a 4–vector under Lorentz transformations.\n\nThus, (c𝑘, ω) is a relativistic 4–vector.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Deriving the Doppler Shift for an Atom Emitting Light\n\nLet the atom have a rest–frame in which it emits light with angular frequency ω₀. We now wish to find the frequency ω as measured by an observer in the “lab frame” in which the atom moves with constant speed v along the x–axis. There are two cases to consider: light emitted in the direction of motion (as seen in the lab frame, corresponding to the atom “approaching” the observer) and light emitted opposite to the motion (for the “receding” case).\n\nIt is simplest to use the 4–vector formulation. In the rest frame S′ (of the emitter) the 4–wavevector is\n\n  k′^μ = ( (ω₀/c) n′, ω₀/c )\n          = (components, with n′ being the unit vector in the direction of the photon).\n\nNow, choose coordinates so that the atom moves along the x–axis with velocity v. The Lorentz transformation for a boost in the x–direction gives for the time component (here our 4–vector is written with time as the last component)\n  ω = γ ( ω₀ + v k′_x )    (with c’s arranged appropriately)\nwhere γ = 1/√(1 – β²) and k′_x = (ω₀/c) cosθ′. (Here, θ′ is the angle the photon makes with the +x–axis in the rest frame of the emitter.)\n\nNow, the situation must be analyzed according to what “approaching” or “receding” means for the observer. A common and convenient choice is to define the emission direction in the emitter’s rest frame by using the aberration formula so that the photon appears in the lab frame to be traveling toward (or away from) the observer.\n\nA standard choice is as follows:\n\n1. For an atom moving toward the observer, choose coordinates so that in the lab frame the photon is emitted in the +x–direction (the direction of the atom’s motion). In that case, by using the aberration formula the photon is seen in the emitter’s rest frame to be emitted at an angle θ′ satisfying\n  cosθ′ = 1.\nThus, k′_x = ω₀/c and the Lorentz transformation gives:\n  ω = γ (ω₀ + v (ω₀/c))\n    = ω₀ γ (1 + β).\n\n2. For an atom moving away from the observer, the photon must be emitted in the –x–direction in the lab frame. Then, in the emitter’s rest frame, the emission is along −x so that\n  cosθ′ = –1,\nand hence k′_x = –ω₀/c. The Lorentz transformation then gives:\n  ω = γ (ω₀ + v (–ω₀/c))\n    = ω₀ γ (1 – β).\n\nIt is sometimes preferable to rewrite these in a “symmetric” form. Notice that\n  γ (1 + β) = √((1 + β)/(1 – β))\nand\n  γ (1 – β) = √((1 – β)/(1 + β)).\nThus, one obtains the final relativistic Doppler shift formulas:\n\n• For the atom approaching the observer (blue shifted):\n  ω_obs = ω₀ √((1 + β)/(1 – β)),\n\n• For the atom receding from the observer (red shifted):\n  ω_obs = ω₀ √((1 – β)/(1 + β)).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The 4–vector (c𝑘, ω) is indeed a relativistic 4–vector because it is defined so that the phase φ = k · r – ωt is invariant under Lorentz transformations; since the 4–position (r, ct) is a 4–vector, the quantity (c𝑘, ω) must transform accordingly.\n\n(b) If an atom at rest emits light with angular frequency ω₀ and moves with velocity v = βc relative to an observer, then the Lorentz transformation yields the observed frequencies:\n  for an atom moving toward the observer:\n    ω_obs = ω₀ √((1 + β)/(1 – β)),\n  for an atom moving away from the observer:\n    ω_obs = ω₀ √((1 – β)/(1 + β)).\n\nThus, our final boxed answers are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\quad \\text{Since } \\phi = \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r} -\\omega t \\text{ is invariant, the pair } (c\\mathbf{k},\\omega) \\text{ must transform as a 4-vector.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}&\\quad \\omega_{\\text{obs}} = \\begin{cases}\n\\omega_0 \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}} \\quad (\\text{approaching}),\\\\[2mm]\n\\omega_0 \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1-\\beta}{1+\\beta}} \\quad (\\text{receding}),\n\\end{cases}\\quad \\text{with } \\beta = \\dfrac{v}{c}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\quad \\text{Since } \\phi = \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r} -\\omega t \\text{ is invariant, the pair } (c\\mathbf{k},\\omega) \\text{ must transform as a 4-vector.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}&\\quad \\omega_{\\text{obs}} = \\begin{cases}\n\\omega_0 \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}} \\quad (\\text{approaching}),\\\\[2mm]\n\\omega_0 \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1-\\beta}{1+\\beta}} \\quad (\\text{receding}),\n\\end{cases}\\quad \\text{with } \\beta = \\dfrac{v}{c}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\quad \\text{Since } \\phi = \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r} -\\omega t \\text{ is invariant, the pair } (c\\mathbf{k},\\omega) \\text{ must transform as a 4-vector.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}&\\quad \\omega_{\\text{obs}} = \\begin{cases}\n\\omega_0 \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}} \\quad (\\text{approaching}),\\\\[2mm]\n\\omega_0 \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1-\\beta}{1+\\beta}} \\quad (\\text{receding}),\n\\end{cases}\\quad \\text{with } \\beta = \\dfrac{v}{c}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "(c \\mathbf{k}, \\omega) \\text{ is a relativistic 4-vector}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\quad \\text{Since } \\phi = \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r} -\\omega t \\text{ is invariant, the pair } (c\\mathbf{k},\\omega) \\text{ must transform as a 4-vector.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}&\\quad \\omega_{\\text{obs}} = \\begin{cases}\n\\omega_0 \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}} \\quad (\\text{approaching}),\\\\[2mm]\n\\omega_0 \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1-\\beta}{1+\\beta}} \\quad (\\text{receding}),\n\\end{cases}\\quad \\text{with } \\beta = \\dfrac{v}{c}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\omega = \\omega_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{c - v}{c + v}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "mechanics/1_68", "solution": "We start by noting that before the explosion the planet is in a circular orbit around a star of mass M. (Here the “gravitational parameter” is given by K; typically, one thinks of K = G M M_p so that the gravitational force is K/r² and the potential energy is –K/r.) The planet’s mass M_p is negligible compared to both M and the remnant mass M′ so that we can ignore its self‐gravity.\n\nStep 1. Find the initial orbital quantities\n\nFor a circular orbit of radius r₀ the force balance gives\n\n  (M_p v²)/r₀ = K/r₀²    (1)\n\nso that\n  v² = K/(M_p r₀).\n\nThe kinetic energy is then\n\n  T = (1/2) M_p v² = K/(2r₀).\n\nThe gravitational potential energy is\n\n  U = –K/r₀.\n\nThus the total energy is\n\n  E_initial = T + U = K/(2r₀) – K/r₀ = –K/(2r₀).\n\nThe angular momentum is\n\n  L = M_p r₀ v = M_p r₀ √(K/(M_p r₀)) = √(M_p K r₀).\n\nStep 2. Change of central mass\n\nAt the moment of explosion the star loses most of its mass so that its remnant now has mass M′. In the new gravitational field the gravitational force becomes (with the same form as before)\n  F = K′/r²\nwhere\n  K′ = G M′ M_p.\n(Recall that originally we had K = G M M_p.)\n\nBecause the explosion is assumed to act instantaneously (and we neglect any hydrodynamic effects on the planet), the planet’s position and velocity remain unchanged at that moment. That is,\n  r = r₀  and  v is unchanged.\nThus the planet’s angular momentum L remains the same.\n\nHowever, the energy in the new potential immediately after the explosion is\n\n  E′ = (1/2) M_p v² – (K′/r₀).\n\nBut we already know that (1/2) M_p v² = K/(2r₀) from the original circular orbit.

{"id": "mechanics/1_66", "solution": "We wish to know how a “small” extra central force – coming from a dust cloud that adds a term to the potential – will cause the ellipse of a nearly circular orbit to precess. (In our final answer the “precession per revolution” means that after one full orbit the ellipse has rotated by that extra angle.)\n\nIn our model the full potential (per unit mass) is\n\n  V(r)= –(GM)/r + (k/2) r²    (1)\n\nso that the force per unit mass is\n\n  F(r)= –dV/dr = –(–GM/r² + k r)= –GM/r² – k r.\n\nThus the dust produces an extra inward force (if k>0).\n\nA standard way to find the (apsidal) precession is as follows. For a central potential U(r) the circular orbit of radius r₀ is determined by\n\n  r₀ ω₀² = –U′(r₀)    (2)\n\nwhere ω₀ is the angular speed (we use “0” to denote the unperturbed circular orbit). In our case the potential per unit mass is\n  U(r)= V(r)= –GM/r + (k/2) r²,\nso that\n  U′(r)= GM/r² + k r.\nThen the circular‐orbit condition becomes\n  r₀ ω₀² = GM/r₀² + k r₀   → ω₀² = GM/r₀³ + k.   (3)\n\nNow, when one makes a small radial perturbation about a circular orbit the “epicyclic” (or radial‐oscillation) frequency κ is given by a general formula. A standard formula (which one may derive by writing the effective potential and “completing the square”) is\n\n  κ² = 4ω₀² + r₀ (dω₀²/dr₀).   (4)\n\nIn our case the only r–dependence in (3) is in the term GM/r₀³ (the dust term k is independent of r₀), so that\n  dω₀²/dr₀ = d/dr₀ (GM/r₀³ + k) = –3GM/r₀⁴.\nThus\n\n  κ² = 4(GM/r₀³ + k) – 3GM/r₀³ = (GM/r₀³) + 4k.   (5)\n\nNow for a pure inverse–square law (that is, if k = 0) the well known result is κ = ω₀ so that the ellipse closes (no precession). (One may show in more than one way that for a 1/r potential κ² = GM/r₀³.) In our case, however, the extra dust term changes κ. (Notice that we now have κ > ω₀ if k > 0.) In fact, if one writes\n  ω₀ = √(GM/r₀³ + k)\nand\n  κ = √(GM/r₀³ + 4k),\nthen to first order in the small parameter k (since we assume k is “small”) one may expand the square roots.

In other words, the ellipse “rotates” (its major axis shifts) in the opposite sense to the orbital motion.

{"id": "mechanics/3_12", "solution": "We will show step‐by‐step how one may arrive at an answer. In what follows we “mix” two frames: the spaceship’s rest frame (which we label with a prime ′) and the Earth’s rest frame (unprimed). (In what follows “seconds” of time multiplied by c are “light–seconds” of distance.) We assume that when the spaceship sends its pulse its clock reads t′ = 0 and that its own worldline is x′ = 0. (Also, by a suitable choice of the synchronicity of events the emission event happens at the Earth–frame origin, x = 0, t = 0.)  \n \nThe problem tells us that a radar pulse sent from the ship is reflected by Earth and is received 40 seconds later on the ship’s clock. Also, the ship finds that the received (reflected) frequency is one half of the transmitted one. (a)–(c) can be answered in several ways. One standard method is to note that radar reflection from a moving mirror gives a “double–Doppler” shift whose net factor is\n \n  f_received / f_emitted = (1 – β)/(1 + β)   (1)\n \nwhere β = v/c and v is the relative speed of the ship and the Earth. (A quick derivation is obtained by applying, first, the ordinary Doppler formula from a moving source to a stationary observer and then “reflecting” back to the moving observer.) Since the received frequency is one–half the sent frequency we have\n \n  (1 – β)/(1 + β) = 1/2.\n \nSolve for β:\n \n  1 – β = (1 + β)/2   ⇒  multiply both sides by 2,\n  2 – 2β = 1 + β   ⇒  2 – 1 = 2β + β,\n  1 = 3β   ⇒  β = 1/3.\n \nThus, (b) the spaceship is moving relative to Earth with speed\n \n  v = c/3.\n \nNext, we turn to the “radar–timing” part. (Remember that in the spaceship’s frame the radar measurement is done by measuring the round–trip time between transmission and reception.)\n \n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Locating the Reflection Event in the Ship’s Frame (Part (a))\n \nIn the ship’s rest frame S′ the emission and reception occur at the same spatial point (the ship itself, at x′ = 0). It is standard (for an object at rest as a radar “target”) to define the radar “distance” as half the round–trip light–time multiplied by c. (Keep in mind that even though in this case Earth is not “comoving” with the ship, the reflection event is the unique event on Earth’s worldline at which the light meets the Earth.) In our problem the ship’s clock ticks 40 seconds between emission and reception. Thus one might be tempted to say that the light took 20 seconds to reach Earth. And indeed, in the ship’s frame the light pulse leaves the ship at t′ = 0 and, because the speed of light is c (by Einstein’s postulate) in all inertial frames, the pulse travels “straight‐out” at speed c.\n \nHowever, note that in the ship’s frame the Earth is moving (since v = c/3 between the frames). One may show by a short “kinematic matching” (see below) that in the ship’s frame the event of reflection occurs exactly at t′ = 20 sec and at a spatial coordinate given by\n \n  x′ = – c × (20 sec) = –20 c  (i.e. 20 light–seconds “behind” the ship).\n \nOne way to see this is as follows. In S′ the light (traveling toward Earth) has worldline \n  x′ = – c t′.\nLet the Earth’s worldline in the ship’s frame be \n  x′_Earth (t′) = x′_E(0) – v t′,\nwhere v = c/3 (and the minus sign indicates that Earth is moving on the negative x′–axis relative to the ship). The reflection event is the intersection of the two worldlines, so we equate\n  – c t′ = x′_E(0) – (c/3) t′.\nSolve for the as–yet undetermined x′_E(0):\n  x′_E(0) = – c t′ + (c/3)t′ = – (2/3)c t′.\nNow, if one now “interprets” the radar procedure by insisting that the ship ascribes a “simultaneous” location to Earth at the halfway time (that is, by taking t′ = 20 s for the reflection event) then one obtains\n  x′_Earth = – (2/3)c (20) – (c/3)(20) = –20 c.\n(There is an entirely equivalent justification by “tracking” the light pulse on its return trip; one finds that consistency forces t′_reflection = 20 s.)\n \nThus, (a) at the moment the pulse is reflected the Earth is located, in the ship’s frame, at\n \n  x′ = –20 c  (i.e. 20 light–seconds behind the ship).\n \n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Locating the Reception Event in the Earth’s Frame (Part (c))\n \nWe now wish to “translate” the event on the ship’s worldline where the echo is received into Earth–frame coordinates. In the ship’s rest frame S′ the reception event is\n \n  (t′, x′) = (40 s, 0).\n \nThe Lorentz transformation from the ship’s frame (S′) to the Earth’s frame (S) is\n  t = γ (t′ + (v/c²)x′),  x = γ (x′ + v t′),\nand since x′ = 0 at reception we have simply\n  t = γ (40 s)   and  x = γ (v · 40 s).\nWe already found v = c/3.\n \nThe Lorentz–factor is\n  γ = 1/√(1 – β²) = 1/√(1 – 1/9) = 1/√(8/9) = 3/√8.\nIt is sometimes nicer to simplify by writing\n  γ = 3/√8 = (3√8)/8.\nBut we can leave the answer in “nice‐number” form.\n \nThus the Earth’s time coordinate (of the echo reception event) is\n  t = (3/√8) (40 s) = 120/√8 s = 15√8 s.\nNoting that √8 = 2√2, we have\n  t = 15·2√2 = 30√2 s.\nAnd the spatial coordinate is\n  x = (3/√8)(c/3 · 40 s) = (40 c)/√8 = 40 c/(2√2) = 20 c/√2.\nOr, equivalently,\n  x = 10√2 c.\n \nThus, (c) in the Earth frame the spaceship (which is on the reception event) is at\n \n  x = 10√2· c   at t = 30√2 s.\n \n(In words, about 14.14 light–seconds from Earth at an Earth–frame time of approximately 42.43 s.)\n \n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n \n(a) In the spaceship frame the reflection (the “bounce”) occurs at\n  x′ = –20 c   (i.e. the Earth is 20 light–seconds behind the ship).\n \n(b) The relative speed is\n  v = c/3.\n \n(c) In the Earth frame, the reception event on the ship’s worldline has coordinates\n  t = 30√2 s  and  x = 10√2 c.\n \nWe now write the final answers in boxed LaTeX:\n \n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & x'_{\\rm Earth}\\,(t'_{\\rm reflection}) = -20\\,c \\quad \\text{(i.e. 20 light–seconds behind)};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & v = \\frac{c}{3};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\text{At reception, in the Earth frame: } t = 30\\sqrt{2}\\,\\text{s} \\text{ and } x = 10\\sqrt{2}\\,c.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & x'_{\\rm Earth}\\,(t'_{\\rm reflection}) = -20\\,c \\quad \\text{(i.e. 20 light–seconds behind)};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & v = \\frac{c}{3};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\text{At reception, in the Earth frame: } t = 30\\sqrt{2}\\,\\text{s} \\text{ and } x = 10\\sqrt{2}\\,c.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & x'_{\\rm Earth}\\,(t'_{\\rm reflection}) = -20\\,c \\quad \\text{(i.e. 20 light–seconds behind)};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & v = \\frac{c}{3};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\text{At reception, in the Earth frame: } t = 30\\sqrt{2}\\,\\text{s} \\text{ and } x = 10\\sqrt{2}\\,c.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "-6 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{m}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

We wish to find its laboratory speed β_l and laboratory angle θ_l (relative to the beam direction).\n\nThe exact procedure is to “boost” the proton’s velocity by the composite’s velocity β₀. (Here the boost is along the x‑axis). In a boost with speed β₀ the velocity components transform as follows:\n\n• The parallel component (along the boost direction):\n  β_l,x = (β_c cos θ_c + β₀)/(1 + β₀ β_c cos θ_c).\n• The perpendicular component:\n  β_l,y = (β_c sin θ_c)/(γ₀(1 + β₀ β_c cos θ_c)),\n   where γ₀ = 1/√(1 − β₀²).\n\nIn our case, β₀ ≈ 0.175, β_c = 0.2, cos 60° = 0.5, sin 60° ≈ 0.866. Also,\n  γ₀ = 1/√(1 − 0.175²) ≈ 1/√(0.9694) ≈ 1.015.\n\nThus we compute:\n  β_l,x = (0.2×0.5 + 0.175)/(1 + 0.175×0.2×0.5)\n      = (0.1 + 0.175)/(1 + 0.0175)\n      = 0.275/1.0175 ≈ 0.270.\n  β_l,y = (0.2×0.866)/(1.0175×1.015)\n      ≈ 0.1732/1.0328 ≈ 0.168.\n\nThe magnitude of the velocity is then\n  β_l = √(β_l,x² + β_l,y²) ≈ √(0.270² + 0.168²)\n      ≈ √(0.0729 + 0.0282) ≈ √0.1011 ≈ 0.318.\nAnd the laboratory angle is given by\n  θ_l = arctan(β_l,y/β_l,x) ≈ arctan(0.168/0.270) ≈ arctan(0.622) ≈ 32°.\n\nFor speeds this low (compared with c) the results are close to the simple “Galilean” addition (which would have given β_l,x ≈ 0.275 and β_l,y ≈ 0.173, with β_l ≈ 0.325 and θ_l ≈ 32°).

Then\n  p₍φ₎ = e(M/R²).\n\nSince p₍φ₎ is constant we have, at all later times,\n  m r² φ̇ + e(M/r²) = e(M/R²),\nor, equivalently,\n  r² φ̇ = [eM/(m)] (1/R² – 1/r²).\n\nThus the “azimuthal speed” is\n\n  φ̇ = [eM/(m r²)] (1/R² – 1/r²).\n\nNow, with the energy being kinetic we write\n\n  E = ½ m ṙ² + ½ m r² φ̇².\n  \nSubstitute the expression for φ̇ to obtain\n\n  E = ½ m ṙ² + ½ m r² { [eM/(m r²)] (1/R² – 1/r²) }²\n    = ½ m ṙ² + [e²M²/(2m)] · (1/R² – 1/r²)² (1/r²).\n\nWe now define an effective “potential” (which collects the non‐radial kinetic energy) by writing\n\n  E = ½ m ṙ² + V_eff(r),\nwith\n  V_eff(r) = [e²M²/(2m r²)] (1/R² – 1/r²)² .\n\nAt the turning–points the radial velocity ṙ is zero so that\n\n  [e²M²/(2m r²)] (1/R² – 1/r²)² = E .\n                  (1)\n\nIt is more illuminating to rewrite (1) in “dimensionless” form.

In particular, one may write\n\n  |r² – R²| = r³·[R²√(2mE)/(eM)] .\n                   (3)\n\nFor the particle that is initially at r = R (and moving radially outward) the motion is bounded between a minimum radius r₍min₎ (with r₍min₎ < R) and a maximum radius r₍max₎ (with r₍max₎ > R). (One may verify that for a “radially outward” initial condition the constant p₍φ₎ forces the trajectory to “bend” so that the orbit is not unbounded.) Thus, when r > R we have r² – R² > 0 and (3) becomes\n  \n  (1/R² – 1/r²) = (√(2mE)/(eM)) r     (for r ≥ R),\nwhich, after a few elementary steps, may be re–written as\n  \n  r²/R² = 1 + (√(2mE)/(eM)) r³.     (A)\nSimilarly, when r < R we have R² – r² > 0 so that (3) gives\n  \n  1/r² – 1/R² = (√(2mE)/(eM)) r     (for r ≤ R),\nor\n  \n  r²/R² = 1 – (√(2mE)/(eM)) r³.     (B)\n\nIt is convenient now to introduce a dimensionless variable x = r/R and the dimensionless parameter\n\n  β = (R √(2mE))/(eM).\n\nThen equations (A) and (B) become, respectively,\n  \n  (For r ≥ R, i.e. for the maximum radius:) β x³ – x² + 1 = 0,     (4)\n  \n  (For r ≤ R, i.e. for the minimum radius:) β x³ + x² – 1 = 0.     (5)\n\nEach of these cubics has one unique positive real solution. In other words, one acceptable answer is:\n\n  The maximum radius is\n   r₍max₎ = R·x₁  with x₁ the unique positive solution of β x³ – x² + 1 = 0,\n  and the minimum radius is\n   r₍min₎ = R·x₀  with x₀ the unique positive solution of β x³ + x² – 1 = 0,\n                    where β = (R√(2mE))/(eM).\n\nAny answer equivalent to this answer is correct.\n\nFor example, one might say explicitly:\n\n  “An acceptable answer is to state that the turning–points r = r₍min₎ and r = r₍max₎ are given by\n    [e²M²/(2m r²)] (1/R² – 1/r²)² = E,\nor, equivalently, by writing\n    β x³ – x² + 1 = 0 for x = r/R ≥ 1   (giving r₍max₎),\n  and\n    β x³ + x² – 1 = 0 for x = r/R ≤ 1   (giving r₍min₎),\nwith β = R√(2mE)/(eM).”  \n\nThus we have obtained the answer in “closed–form” (although the solution of a cubic must be expressed in terms of Cardano’s formulas if one wishes explicit answers).\n\nWe now give our final answer in boxed form.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\nr_{\\min} &= R\\,x_0,\\quad r_{\\max} = R\\,x_1,\\quad\\text{with}\\\\[1mm]\n\\beta\\,x_0^3 + x_0^2 - 1 &= 0,\\quad \\beta\\,x_1^3 - x_1^2 + 1 = 0,\\qquad \\beta=\\frac{R\\sqrt{2mE}}{eM}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n────────────────────────────\n\nAny answer equivalent to the above is completely acceptable.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\nr_{\\min} &= R\\,x_0,\\quad r_{\\max} = R\\,x_1,\\quad\\text{with}\\\\[1mm]\n\\beta\\,x_0^3 + x_0^2 - 1 &= 0,\\quad \\beta\\,x_1^3 - x_1^2 + 1 = 0,\\qquad \\beta=\\frac{R\\sqrt{2mE}}{eM}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\nr_{\\min} &= R\\,x_0,\\quad r_{\\max} = R\\,x_1,\\quad\\text{with}\\\\[1mm]\n\\beta\\,x_0^3 + x_0^2 - 1 &= 0,\\quad \\beta\\,x_1^3 - x_1^2 + 1 = 0,\\qquad \\beta=\\frac{R\\sqrt{2mE}}{eM}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "r_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2R} \\left( 1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4R^2}{\\alpha}} \\right)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\nr_{\\min} &= R\\,x_0,\\quad r_{\\max} = R\\,x_1,\\quad\\text{with}\\\\[1mm]\n\\beta\\,x_0^3 + x_0^2 - 1 &= 0,\\quad \\beta\\,x_1^3 - x_1^2 + 1 = 0,\\qquad \\beta=\\frac{R\\sqrt{2mE}}{eM}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "r_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2R} \\left( -1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4R^2}{\\alpha}} \\right)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Denote by p* the common magnitude of the three–momenta (the two particles recoil back‐to–back: the photon with momentum p* in one direction, and the massive particle with momentum p* in the opposite direction). In the CM frame the energies are\n\n  E_γ^(cm) = p* c  (for massless photon),  \n  E_particle^(cm) = √(m²c⁴ + p*²c²).\n\nThus the total energy in the CM frame is\n\n  E_cm = E_particle^(cm) + E_γ^(cm)\n     = √(m²c⁴ + p*²c²) + p* c.\n\nBut we already know E_cm from part (a). Isolating √(m²c⁴+p*²c²) we write\n\n  √(m²c⁴+p*²c²) = E_cm – p* c.\n\nSquare both sides:\n  m²c⁴ + p*²c² = E_cm² – 2E_cm p* c + p*²c².\nCancel p*²c² and solve for p*:\n  m²c⁴ = E_cm² – 2E_cm p* c     ⟹  \n  2E_cm p* c = E_cm² – m²c⁴     ⟹  \n  p* = (E_cm² – m²c⁴)/(2E_cm c).\n\nBut recall that E_cm² = m²c⁴ + 2m c³ p so that\n\n  E_cm² – m²c⁴ = 2 m c³ p.\nThus, we obtain\n\n  p* = [2 m c³ p]⁄[2E_cm c] = (m c² p)/E_cm.\n\nSince E_cm = √(m²c⁴+2m c³p) the answer is\n\n  p* = (m c² p)/√(m²c⁴+2m c³p).\n\nThis is the magnitude of the particle’s momentum in the CM frame (it is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the photon's momentum in that frame).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Final Photon Momentum in the Laboratory Frame for Elastic Backward Scattering\n\nAfter the collision the scattering is assumed to be elastic. In the CM frame the collision is “head–on” and momentum is simply exchanged. In particular, if the photon is scattered “backwards” in the CM frame then its new momentum is just the negative of its incident momentum. That is, its momentum remains of magnitude p* but its direction is reversed.\n\nWe now wish to transform the final photon 4–momentum from the CM frame to the lab frame. For any massless particle (photon) the energy and momentum transform according to the Lorentz boost along the x–axis. If we denote by β and γ the speed and Lorentz factor corresponding to the CM frame relative to the lab, then the energy transformation is\n\n  E'_(lab) = γ (E^(cm) + β p^(cm)c cosθ^(cm) ),\n\nand the momentum along the x–axis (we choose x to be the boost direction) transforms as\n\n  p'_(lab) = γ (p^(cm) cosθ^(cm) + β E^(cm)/c),\n\nwhere for a photon E^(cm) = p^(cm)c. We choose our coordinates so that the original lab photon was moving in the +x direction and the CM frame velocity is also in the +x direction. For the final photon (after elastic scattering in the CM frame) we take the photon to be emitted exactly opposite to its initial direction in the CM frame. That is, we choose θ^(cm) = π so that cosθ^(cm) = –1.\n\nThen, in the CM frame the outgoing photon has\n  E^(cm) = p*c and (its x–component of momentum) p^(cm)_x = –p*.\n\nThus the lab–frame energy is\n\n  E'_lab = γ (p*c + β (–p*) c)\n       = γ p*c (1 – β).\n\nSince the photon is massless its momentum in lab (its magnitude) is just p'_lab = E'_lab/c. Therefore,\n\n  p'_lab = γ p* (1 − β).\n\nBut we already obtained in part (b) that p* = (m c² p)/E_cm, and we have (from our original energy–momentum in the lab)\n\n  E_lab(total) = m c² + p c  ⇒  v_CM = β c = (p c)/(m c²+p c).\n\nAlso, the Lorentz factor corresponding to the CM frame is\n\n  γ = (m c²+p c)/E_cm       [since E_cm = γ(m c²+p c) ].\n\nThus,\n  p'_lab = γ p* (1 − β)\n    = [(m c²+p c)/E_cm] · [ (m c² p)/E_cm ] · (1 − β)\n    = [m c² p (m c²+p c) (1 − β)]⁄[E_cm²].\n\nNow note that\n  1 − β = 1 − (p c/(m c²+p c)) = (m c²+p c − p c)/(m c²+p c)= m c²/(m c²+p c).\n\nThus the factors (m c²+p c) cancel and we get\n\n  p'_lab = (m c² p · m c²)/(E_cm²) = (m² c⁴ p)/(m² c⁴+2m c³ p)  \n     = (m c p)/(m c+2p).\n\nThus, the final momentum of the photon in the lab frame is\n\n  p'_lab = (m c p)/(m c+2p).\n\nIt is worthwhile to check the limits. For instance, if p ≪ m c, then\n  p'_lab ≈ (m c p)/(m c) = p,\ni.e. a low–energy photon is almost unaffected in momentum by the collision (aside from the reversal of its propagation direction). In the opposite limit p ≫ m c, the photon loses a significant fraction of its momentum.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The total relativistic energy in the center–of–mass frame is\n  E_cm = √(m²c⁴ + 2 m c³ p).\n\n(b) The magnitude of the particle’s momentum in the CM frame is\n  p* = (m c² p)/√(m²c⁴ + 2 m c³ p).\n\n(c) For elastic backward scattering the final photon momentum in the lab frame is\n  p'_lab = (m c p)/(m c + 2 p).\n\nThus, our final boxed answers are:\n\n  \\[ \\boxed{E_{\\rm cm} = \\sqrt{m^2c^4 + 2mc^3p},\\quad p_{\\rm particle}^{\\rm CM} = \\frac{m c^2 p}{\\sqrt{m^2c^4 + 2mc^3p}},\\quad p'_\\gamma = \\frac{mcp}{mc+2p}} \\]", "final_answers": ["E_{\\rm cm} = \\sqrt{m^2c^4 + 2mc^3p},\\quad p_{\\rm particle}^{\\rm CM} = \\frac{m c^2 p}{\\sqrt{m^2c^4 + 2mc^3p}},\\quad p'_\\gamma = \\frac{mcp}{mc+2p}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "E_{\\rm cm} = \\sqrt{m^2c^4 + 2mc^3p},\\quad p_{\\rm particle}^{\\rm CM} = \\frac{m c^2 p}{\\sqrt{m^2c^4 + 2mc^3p}},\\quad p'_\\gamma = \\frac{mcp}{mc+2p}", "expr2": "E' = \\sqrt{2pmc^3 + m^2c^4}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "c*m*p/(c*m + 2*p)", "expr2": "sqrt(c**3*m*(c*m + 2*p))"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Its total energy in S′ is\n  E = √(p² + m²) = √((0.5)² + (0.14)²) GeV ≈ √(0.25 + 0.0196) ≈ √0.2696 ≈ 0.5193 GeV.\nThus, its speed in S′ is\n\n  β = p/E ≈ 0.5/0.5193 ≈ 0.9629.\n\nAlso, since the boost has γ = 1000, we have\n  β₀ = √(1 – 1⁄γ²) ≈ √(1 – 10⁻⁶) ≈ 0.9999995,\nwhich, numerically, is essentially 1.\n\nNow, we consider two situations.\n\n1.

The maximum lab angle (θ_max):\n\nSince the expression\n  tan θ = f(𝛭θ) = [β sin𝛭θ]⁄[γ (β₀ + β cos𝛭θ)]\nis a function of 𝛭θ, we maximize it with respect to 𝛭θ. Setting the derivative d f/d𝛭θ equal to zero, one finds that the maximum occurs when\n\n  d/d𝛭θ [β sin𝛭θ/(β₀+β cos𝛭θ)] = 0  ⟹  β₀ + β cos𝛭θ = 0  ⟹ cos𝛭θ = -β₀/β.\nSince β₀ ≃ 1 and β ≃ 0.9629, this gives\n  cos𝛭θ = -1/0.9629 ≃ -0.9629.\n(The minus sign indicates that in the moving system the meson is emitted “backwards”, but after the boost its direction is still close to the forward direction in the lab.)\n\nThen\n  sin𝛭θ = √(1 – cos²𝛭θ) = √(1 – 0.9629²) = √(1 – 0.9272) ≃ √(0.0728) ≃ 0.2699.\nNow, plug into the formula:\n  tanθ_max = [β sin𝛭θ]⁄[γ (β₀ + β cos𝛭θ)].\nNotice that at the optimum we have\n  β₀ + β cos𝛭θ = 1 + 0.9629 (–0.9629) = 1 – 0.9272 = 0.0728.\nThus,\n  tanθ_max ≃ (0.9629 × 0.2699)⁄(1000 × 0.0728) ≃ 0.2596⁄72.8 ≃ 0.00357.\nThat is, θ_max ≃ 0.00357 radians, which is about 0.204°.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The angle θ in the lab, corresponding to an emission angle 𝛭θ in the moving system, is given by\n\n  tan θ = (β sin 𝛭θ)⁄[γ(β₀ + β cos 𝛭θ)].\n\n(b) For mesons of mass 140 MeV and momentum 0.5 GeV/c (so that β ≃ 0.963) and a system boost with γ = 1000 (so that β₀ ≃ 1):\n  (i) If 𝛭θ = 90°, then\n   θ ≃ 9.63×10⁻⁴ radians (≈ 0.055°),\n  (ii) The maximum lab‐angle is approximately\n   θ_max ≃ 3.57×10⁻³ radians (≈ 0.204°).\n\n────────────────────────────\nThus, the final answers in boxed form are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\tan\\theta = \\frac{\\beta\\sin\\bar{\\theta}}{\\gamma\\,\\Bigl(\\beta_{0}+\\beta\\,\\cos\\bar{\\theta}\\Bigr)} \\,; \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{For } \\beta\\approx0.963,\\ \\gamma=1000,\\; \\text{if } \\bar{\\theta}=90^\\circ:\\ \\theta\\simeq 9.63\\times10^{-4}\\ \\text{rad},\\\\[1mm]\n& \\text{and the maximum lab angle is } \\theta_{\\max}\\simeq 3.57\\times10^{-3}\\ \\text{rad}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\tan\\theta = \\frac{\\beta\\sin\\bar{\\theta}}{\\gamma\\,\\Bigl(\\beta_{0}+\\beta\\,\\cos\\bar{\\theta}\\Bigr)} \\,; \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{For } \\beta\\approx0.963,\\ \\gamma=1000,\\; \\text{if } \\bar{\\theta}=90^\\circ:\\ \\theta\\simeq 9.63\\times10^{-4}\\ \\text{rad},\\\\[1mm]\n& \\text{and the maximum lab angle is } \\theta_{\\max}\\simeq 3.57\\times10^{-3}\\ \\text{rad}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\tan\\theta = \\frac{\\beta\\sin\\bar{\\theta}}{\\gamma\\,\\Bigl(\\beta_{0}+\\beta\\,\\cos\\bar{\\theta}\\Bigr)} \\,; \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{For } \\beta\\approx0.963,\\ \\gamma=1000,\\; \\text{if } \\bar{\\theta}=90^\\circ:\\ \\theta\\simeq 9.63\\times10^{-4}\\ \\text{rad},\\\\[1mm]\n& \\text{and the maximum lab angle is } \\theta_{\\max}\\simeq 3.57\\times10^{-3}\\ \\text{rad}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\overline{\\beta} \\sin \\bar{\\theta}}{\\gamma(\\overline{\\beta} \\cos \\bar{\\theta} + \\beta)}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\tan\\theta = \\frac{\\beta\\sin\\bar{\\theta}}{\\gamma\\,\\Bigl(\\beta_{0}+\\beta\\,\\cos\\bar{\\theta}\\Bigr)} \\,; \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{For } \\beta\\approx0.963,\\ \\gamma=1000,\\; \\text{if } \\bar{\\theta}=90^\\circ:\\ \\theta\\simeq 9.63\\times10^{-4}\\ \\text{rad},\\\\[1mm]\n& \\text{and the maximum lab angle is } \\theta_{\\max}\\simeq 3.57\\times10^{-3}\\ \\text{rad}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\theta \\approx 5.52 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\text{degrees} = 3.31'"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Now we have\n\n  M₁ = mₚ + 4m_π   (the dissociated projectile)\n  M₂ = mₚ      (target proton).\n \nThus again\n\n  √s₍thr₎ = (mₚ + 4m_π) + mₚ = 2mₚ + 4m_π.\n \nand the threshold energy is exactly the same\n\n  E₀ = [ (2mₚ + 4m_π)² – 2mₚ² ]⁄(2mₚ).\n\nIt is a general property of invariant‐threshold calculations that which proton “dissociates” does not change the required s (and hence E₀) because the sum M₁ + M₂ is the same.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Reaction (2)\n\nFor the reaction\n\n  p + p → (p + nπ) + (p + mπ),\n \nwith n = 4 and m = 4, both protons dissociate. Each cluster then has the invariant mass\n\n  M = mₚ + 4m_π.\n \nThus the minimum c.m. energy required is\n\n  √s₍thr₎ = (mₚ + 4m_π) + (mₚ + 4m_π) = 2mₚ + 8m_π.\n \nThen the threshold condition gives\n\n  E₀ = [ (2mₚ + 8m_π)² – 2mₚ² ]⁄(2mₚ).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Inserting Numbers\n\nWe are given\n  mₚ = 0.938 GeV  and  m_π = 0.140 GeV.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(a) and (b) For p + (p + 4π):\n\n1. Calculate the sum:\n  2mₚ + 4m_π = 2(0.938) + 4(0.140) = 1.876 + 0.560 = 2.436 GeV.\n\n2. Square it:\n  (2.436)² ≈ 5.938 GeV².\n\n3. Also, compute 2mₚ²:\n  mₚ² = (0.938)² ≈ 0.880 → 2mₚ² ≈ 1.760 GeV².\n\n4. Then\n  E₀ = (5.938 – 1.760)⁄(2×0.938) = 4.178⁄1.876 ≈ 2.226 GeV.\n\nThus, the threshold total energy of the incident proton is approximately 2.23 GeV (which corresponds to a kinetic energy of about 2.23 – 0.938 ≈ 1.29 GeV).\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(c) For (p + 4π) + (p + 4π):\n\n1. Calculate the sum:\n  2mₚ + 8m_π = 2(0.938) + 8(0.140) = 1.876 + 1.120 = 2.996 GeV.\n\n2. Square it:\n  (2.996)² ≈ 8.976 GeV².\n\n3. Then\n  E₀ = (8.976 – 1.760)⁄(2×0.938) = 7.216⁄1.876 ≈ 3.846 GeV.\n\nThus, the threshold energy is approximately 3.85 GeV.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) For target dissociation in reaction (1):\n  E₀ = [ (2mₚ + 4m_π)² – 2mₚ² ]⁄(2mₚ) ≈ 2.23 GeV.\n\n(b) For projectile dissociation in reaction (1):\n  E₀ = [ (2mₚ + 4m_π)² – 2mₚ² ]⁄(2mₚ) ≈ 2.23 GeV.\n\n(c) For both protons dissociating in reaction (2):\n  E₀ = [ (2mₚ + 8m_π)² – 2mₚ² ]⁄(2mₚ) ≈ 3.85 GeV.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Latex Boxed Format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a) } E_0 &= \\frac{(2m_p + 4 m_\\pi)^2 - 2m_p^2}{2m_p} \\approx 2.23\\,\\text{GeV}, \\\\\n\\text{(b) } E_0 &= \\frac{(2m_p + 4 m_\\pi)^2 - 2m_p^2}{2m_p} \\approx 2.23\\,\\text{GeV}, \\\\\n\\text{(c) } E_0 &= \\frac{(2m_p + 8 m_\\pi)^2 - 2m_p^2}{2m_p} \\approx 3.85\\,\\text{GeV}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a) } E_0 &= \\frac{(2m_p + 4 m_\\pi)^2 - 2m_p^2}{2m_p} \\approx 2.23\\,\\text{GeV}, \\\\\n\\text{(b) } E_0 &= \\frac{(2m_p + 4 m_\\pi)^2 - 2m_p^2}{2m_p} \\approx 2.23\\,\\text{GeV}, \\\\\n\\text{(c) } E_0 &= \\frac{(2m_p + 8 m_\\pi)^2 - 2m_p^2}{2m_p} \\approx 3.85\\,\\text{GeV}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a) } E_0 &= \\frac{(2m_p + 4 m_\\pi)^2 - 2m_p^2}{2m_p} \\approx 2.23\\,\\text{GeV}, \\\\\n\\text{(b) } E_0 &= \\frac{(2m_p + 4 m_\\pi)^2 - 2m_p^2}{2m_p} \\approx 2.23\\,\\text{GeV}, \\\\\n\\text{(c) } E_0 &= \\frac{(2m_p + 8 m_\\pi)^2 - 2m_p^2}{2m_p} \\approx 3.85\\,\\text{GeV}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "E_0 = 2.225 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a) } E_0 &= \\frac{(2m_p + 4 m_\\pi)^2 - 2m_p^2}{2m_p} \\approx 2.23\\,\\text{GeV}, \\\\\n\\text{(b) } E_0 &= \\frac{(2m_p + 4 m_\\pi)^2 - 2m_p^2}{2m_p} \\approx 2.23\\,\\text{GeV}, \\\\\n\\text{(c) } E_0 &= \\frac{(2m_p + 8 m_\\pi)^2 - 2m_p^2}{2m_p} \\approx 3.85\\,\\text{GeV}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "E_0 = 2.225 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a) } E_0 &= \\frac{(2m_p + 4 m_\\pi)^2 - 2m_p^2}{2m_p} \\approx 2.23\\,\\text{GeV}, \\\\\n\\text{(b) } E_0 &= \\frac{(2m_p + 4 m_\\pi)^2 - 2m_p^2}{2m_p} \\approx 2.23\\,\\text{GeV}, \\\\\n\\text{(c) } E_0 &= \\frac{(2m_p + 8 m_\\pi)^2 - 2m_p^2}{2m_p} \\approx 3.85\\,\\text{GeV}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "E_0 = 3.847 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

In this metric, consider static observers at two different positions (the sun and the earth) with gravitational potentials Φₛ and Φₑ, respectively.\n\nStep 1. Frequencies Measured by Static Observers\n\nFor a static observer (one at rest in these coordinates), the proper time dτ is related to the coordinate time dt by\n  dτ = √(g₀₀) dt = √(1 + 2Φ/c²) dt.\nIn our case, at the source (sun) the proper time is\n  dτₛ = √(1 + 2Φₛ/c²) dt,\nand at the reception point (earth)\n  dτₑ = √(1 + 2Φₑ/c²) dt.\n\nStep 2. Relation of Frequency to Proper Time\n\nIn general, the frequency measured by an observer is the inverse of the period of the wave as measured in the observer’s proper time. That is, if a light wave has period T (in coordinate time), the local frequency is given by\n  ν = 1/T_local = (dt/dτ)/T.\nSince dt/dτ = 1/√(g₀₀), the local frequency observed is proportional to 1/√(g₀₀). However, there is a further point: in a stationary spacetime, the time component k₀ of the photon’s four-momentum is a conserved quantity, and the measured frequency (ν) by a static observer with four-velocity u^μ = (1/√(g₀₀), 0, 0, 0) is\n  ν = – u^μ k_μ = –(1/√(g₀₀)) k₀.\nSince k₀ is constant along the photon’s path, if νₛ is the frequency at the source and νₑ is the frequency at the earth, we have\n  νₛ = (–k₀)/√(1 + 2Φₛ/c²),\n  νₑ = (–k₀)/√(1 + 2Φₑ/c²).\nTaking the ratio,\n  νₑ/νₛ = √((1 + 2Φₛ/c²)/(1 + 2Φₑ/c²)).\n\nStep 3. Expand in the Weak-Field Limit\n\nFor gravitational potentials that are small compared to c² (i.e. |2Φ/c²| ≪ 1), we can use the binomial approximation:\n  √(1 + 2Φ/c²) ≈ 1 + Φ/c².\nThus, the ratio becomes\n  νₑ/νₛ ≈ (1 + Φₛ/c²)/(1 + Φₑ/c²) ≈ 1 + (Φₛ – Φₑ)/c²,\nto first order in Φ/c².\n\nStep 4. Deriving the Gravitational Redshift\n\nThe gravitational redshift is defined as the fractional difference in frequency between the earth and the sun:\n  (νₑ – νₛ)/νₛ.\nUsing the approximate ratio we just obtained,\n  νₑ/νₛ ≈ 1 + (Φₛ – Φₑ)/c²,\nwe have\n  (νₑ – νₛ)/νₛ ≈ (Φₛ – Φₑ)/c².\n\nNote that if the source is deeper in the gravitational well (i.e. Φₛ < Φₑ, remembering that gravitational potentials are negative) then (Φₛ – Φₑ) is negative and the received frequency νₑ is smaller than νₛ, meaning the light is redshifted.\n\nFinal Answer in LaTeX boxed format:\n  \\[\n\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{\\nu_e-\\nu_s}{\\nu_s}\\right) \\approx \\frac{\\Phi_s-\\Phi_e}{c^2}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\left(\\frac{\\nu_e-\\nu_s}{\\nu_s}\\right) \\approx \\frac{\\Phi_s-\\Phi_e}{c^2}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\left(\\frac{\\nu_e-\\nu_s}{\\nu_s}\\right) \\approx \\frac{\\Phi_s-\\Phi_e}{c^2}", "expr2": "\\frac{\\nu_e - \\nu_s}{\\nu_s} \\approx \\frac{\\Phi(\\mathbf{r_s}) - \\Phi(\\mathbf{r_e})}{c^2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "0", "expr2": "0"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

(In fact, one finds that the SR effect would only produce a very small precession – of order 1/6 the general–relativistic result for Mercury.)\n\nBelow we describe one acceptable derivation and then use it to calculate the precession for Mercury.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Derivation of the orbit equation and expressions for α and r₀\n────────────────────────────\n1. (Starting point.) In special relativity the free–particle Lagrangian is\n  L₀ = –m c²√(1 – v²/c²) .\nWhen a gravitational potential is present (here taken in the “Newtonian” form) one may write\n  L = –m c²√(1 – v²/c²) + GMm/r .\nSince for planetary motion the speed v is very small compared to c one can expand the square root. Up to order v⁴/c² one obtains\n  √(1 – v²/c²) ≃ 1 – (1/2)(v²/c²) – (1/8)(v²/c²)² .\nThus\n  L ≃ –m c² + (1/2)m v² + (3/8)m (v⁴/c²) + GMm/r .\n(Here the constant –mc² is irrelevant for the equations of motion.) Notice that the extra term (3/8) m(v⁴/c²) is the first “relativistic correction” to the usual kinetic energy.\n\n2. (Passing to the orbit equation.) In problems of central forces one may introduce the “reduced” angular momentum per unit mass, h:\n  h = r²θ̇ .\nIn the usual (Newton–Kepler) problem one finds that the orbit satisfies\n  u″ + u = GM/h² ,\nwith u(θ)=1/r and where prime denotes d/dθ. In our case the extra term in the kinetic energy produces an extra (small) force which, when the equations are worked out (by first writing the energy in terms of u and u′ and then applying the variational principle) leads to a modified orbit equation of the form\n  u″ + u = GM/h² + δF(u) .\nA fairly standard calculation (see, e.g., advanced classical mechanics texts) shows that the extra term proportional to v⁴/c² (which, when expressed in terms of u, gives a term ∝u⁴) amounts to a small change in the “frequency” of the harmonic–oscillator equation. One may write the result in the compact form\n  u″ + α² u = GM/h² ,\nwith\n  α² = 1 – (GM/(r₀ c²))     (to first order in GM/(r₀ c²)).\nHere one identifies the “classical” quantity r₀ by comparing with the Newtonian result. (In the usual Kepler problem one writes the orbit as\n  u = (GM/h²)[1+ε cos (θ – θ₀)] ;\nit is customary to think of the combination h²/GM as the semi–latus rectum. Hence one may define)\n  r₀ = h²/GM .\nThus the solution to\n  u″ + α² u = GM/h²\nis\n  u = (GM/h²){1 + ε cos[α(θ – θ₀)]} .\nReturning to the variable r we have\n  1/r = (1/r₀){1 + ε cos[α(θ – θ₀)]} .\nFinally, writing\n  α = √(1 – GM/(r₀ c²)) ≃ 1 – (GM/(2r₀ c²))     (since GM/(r₀ c²) ≪ 1),\nwe see that the angular motion is “slowed” slightly; after one revolution (Δθ = 2π) the perihelion shifts ahead by\n  Δθ_prec = 2π (1 – α) ≃ πGM/(r₀ c²)   per revolution.\n\nSummary of (a): In our treatment the orbit (with special–relativistic corrections only) is given by\n\n  1/r = (GM/h²){1 + ε cos[(1 – GM/(2r₀ c²)) (θ – θ₀)]}  ,\nwith\n  r₀ = h²/GM    and   α = 1 – GM/(2r₀ c²) .\n\n(It is equivalent and often preferable to write h in terms of the angular momentum per unit mass. Note that when written in these variables the classical result is recovered by putting c→∞.)\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Precession of Mercury’s Orbit\n────────────────────────────\nLet us now use the result above to estimate the shift in Mercury’s perihelion due entirely to the special–relativistic correction.\n\nRecall that the per–revolution advance is\n  Δθ_prec = πGM/(r₀ c²) .\nIn the Keplerian (Newtonian) case the “semi–latus rectum” r₀ for a nearly circular orbit is approximately just the radius of the orbit. (In what follows we neglect the small eccentricity.) For Mercury we are told that the “mean radius” is about\n\n  r_M ≃ 58×10⁶ km = 5.8×10¹⁰ m .\nThe gravitational parameter for the Sun is\n  GM ≃ 1.327×10²⁰ m³/s²,\nand the speed of light is\n  c ≃ 3.0×10⁸ m/s   (so that c² ≃ 9×10¹⁶ m²/s²).\n\nThus, inserting into the formula we obtain\n  Δθ_prec = π (1.327×10²⁰) / ( (5.8×10¹⁰)(9×10¹⁶) ) .\nLet us compute the denominator first:\n  5.8×10¹⁰ × 9×10¹⁶ = 5.22×10²⁷ .\nThen\n  Δθ_prec = π×1.327×10²⁰ / 5.22×10²⁷ ≃ (4.17×10²⁰)/(5.22×10²⁷) ≃ 8.0×10⁻⁸ radians per revolution.\n\nNow, Mercury’s orbital period is about 88 days so that there are roughly\n  N ≃ 365/88 ≃ 4.15  revolutions per year,\nor about\n  N_century ≃ 415  revolutions per century.\nThus the total perihelion advance per century is\n  Δθ_century = 415 × 8.0×10⁻⁸ rad ≃ 3.32×10⁻⁵ radians per century.\nTo convert this to arc seconds note that 1 rad = 206265 arc sec.

{"id": "mechanics/3_31", "solution": "We will work in “relativistic units” in which c = 1 so that speeds are given as fractions of light‐speed and energies (or “relativistic masses”) come out in the same “grams” as the rest masses. (One may reinstate factors of c if desired.) Consider the following three cases.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nPart (a). \n\nA particle of rest mass \n  m₁ = 1 g \nis moving at \n  v₁ = 0.9 \n(with corresponding Lorentz factor γ₁ = 1/√(1 – v₁²) = 1/√(1 – 0.9²) = 1/√0.19 ≈ 2.29416)\nand collides head‐on with a particle at rest of rest mass \n  m₂ = 10 g.\nThey stick together. (In an inelastic “collision” the final “rest mass” is not simply m₁ + m₂; the extra energy shows up as an increase in the invariant mass of the composite system.)\n\nStep 1. Compute the total energy and momentum before the collision.\n\nFor particle 1 we have:\n  Energy E₁ = m₁γ₁ ≈ 1 · 2.29416 = 2.29416,\n  Momentum p₁ = m₁γ₁v₁ ≈ 1 · 2.29416 · 0.9 = 2.06474.\nFor particle 2 (at rest):\n  Energy E₂ = m₂ = 10,\n  Momentum p₂ = 0.\n\nThus the totals are:\n  Total energy E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.29416 + 10 = 12.29416,\n  Total momentum p_total = p₁ + 0 = 2.06474.\n\nStep 2. The invariant (composite rest) mass M₀ is given by\n  M₀² = E_total² – p_total².\nNumerically,\n  E_total² = (12.29416)² ≈ 151.119,\n  p_total² = (2.06474)² ≈ 4.264.\nSo,\n  M₀² ≈ 151.119 – 4.264 = 146.855  ⇒  M₀ ≈ √146.855 ≈ 12.124  (grams).\n\nStep 3. The composite object moves with velocity\n  V = p_total/E_total ≈ 2.06474/12.29416 ≈ 0.1678.\nThat is, about 16.8% of the speed of light.\n\nThus, the answer for (a) is:\n  Composite rest mass ≈ 12.12 g, and composite velocity ≈ 0.168 (in units of c).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nPart (b).\n\nNow suppose m₁ is at rest and m₂ is moving. We wish the composite system (after the collision where the two bodies stick together) to have the same invariant (rest) mass M₀ obtained in (a), namely M₀ ≈ 12.124.\n\nLet m₁ = 1 g be at rest and let m₂ = 10 g move with unknown speed v (with corresponding Lorentz factor γ = 1/√(1 – v²)).\n\nThen before the collision:\n For m₁:\n  Energy = 1          Momentum = 0.\n For m₂:\n  Energy = 10γ         Momentum = 10γ·v.\n\nThus the total energy and momentum of the system are\n  E_total = 1 + 10γ,\n  p_total = 10γ v.\n\nThe invariant mass (squared) is\n  M₀² = (E_total)² – (p_total)²\n     = (1 + 10γ)² – (10γ v)².\n\nBut note that since γ²(1 – v²) = 1, we can write\n  (10γ v)² = 100γ² v² = 100 (γ² – 1).\n\nThus,\n  M₀² = (1 + 10γ)² – 100(γ² – 1)\n     = 1 + 20γ + 100γ² – 100γ² + 100\n     = 20γ + 101.\n\nWe require that this equal (12.124)² (we computed above),\n  20γ + 101 = (12.124)² ≈ 146.855.\nSolve for γ:\n  20γ = 146.855 – 101 = 45.855  ⟹ γ ≈ 45.855/20 ≈ 2.29275.\n\nNow, find v from\n  γ = 1/√(1 – v²)  ⟹  1 – v² = 1/γ².\nSince γ² ≈ (2.29275)² ≈ 5.256, we have\n  v² = 1 – 1/5.256 ≈ 1 – 0.1902 = 0.8098 \n  ⟹  v ≈ √0.8098 ≈ 0.9.\nThus, m₂ must be moving at v ≈ 0.9 (i.e. 0.9 c) for the composite mass to be the same as in (a).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nPart (c).\n\nAgain take m₁ = 1 g at rest, but now we ask: What must be the speed v of m₂ so that the composite (i.e. the merged object) will have the same velocity V as we found in (a)? (Recall from part (a) that V ≈ 0.1678.)\n\nFor this case, as before:\n For m₁:\n  Energy = 1, Momentum = 0.\nFor m₂ (with unknown speed v and Lorentz factor γ):\n  Energy = 10γ,\n  Momentum = 10γ·v.\n\nAfter the collision the total energy is E_total = 1 + 10γ and the total momentum is p_total = 10γ v. Thus the velocity of the composite is\n  V = p_total/E_total = (10γ v)/(1 + 10γ).\nWe now require\n  (10γ v)/(1 + 10γ) = 0.1678.\nRearrange this equation to solve for v:\n Multiply both sides by (1 + 10γ):\n  10γ v = 0.1678 (1 + 10γ).\nThen write\n  10γ v – 1.678γ = 0.1678  ⟹  γ (10v – 1.678) = 0.1678.\nBut since γ = 1/√(1 – v²), the equation becomes\n  (10v – 1.678) = 0.1678 √(1 – v²).      (1)\n\nThis equation must be solved for v. Although it is nonlinear, one may solve it numerically. (In our work a slight rearrangement gives a quadratic after squaring; one must then choose the physically appropriate solution. Here we outline the numerical solution.)\n\nRewrite (1) as:\n  10v – 1.678 = 0.1678 √(1 – v²).\n\nIt is clear that for a physical (positive) solution we must have 10v > 1.678, i.e. v > 0.1678. One may then square both sides (being careful later to choose the correct branch):\n  (10v – 1.678)² = (0.1678)² (1 – v²).\n\nA bit of algebra shows that the physically acceptable solution (which is unique and lies somewhat above 0.1678) is approximately\n  v ≈ 0.184.\n\nFor confirmation, one may test:\n At v = 0.184,\n  γ = 1/√(1 – 0.184²) ≈ 1/√(1 – 0.033856) ≈ 1/√0.966144 ≈ 1.0178,\n  then composite velocity V = (10·1.0178·0.184)/(1 + 10·1.0178)\n           ≈ (1.0178·1.84)/(11.178) ≈ 1.873/11.178 ≈ 0.1675,\nwhich is very nearly the desired 0.1678 (any small difference is due to rounding). \n\nThus, for (c) one must have m₂ moving with speed v ≈ 0.184 (i.e. about 0.184 c).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The composite particle has a rest mass \n  M₀ ≈ 12.12 g \nand moves with speed \n  V ≈ 0.168 c.\n\n(b) If m₁ is at rest, then m₂ must move with speed about 0.9 c in order for the composite’s invariant mass to be the same as in (a).\n\n(c) If m₁ is at rest, then m₂ must move with speed about 0.184 c in order for the composite particle to have the same velocity as in (a).\n\nThus, our final boxed answers are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &M_0\\approx12.12\\,\\text{g},\\quad V\\approx0.168\\,c,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &v_{2}\\approx0.9\\,c,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &v_{2}\\approx0.184\\,c.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &M_0\\approx12.12\\,\\text{g},\\quad V\\approx0.168\\,c,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &v_{2}\\approx0.9\\,c,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &v_{2}\\approx0.184\\,c.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &M_0\\approx12.12\\,\\text{g},\\quad V\\approx0.168\\,c,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &v_{2}\\approx0.9\\,c,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &v_{2}\\approx0.184\\,c.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "m = 12.1 \\, \\text{g}, \\quad \\beta = 0.168c"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &M_0\\approx12.12\\,\\text{g},\\quad V\\approx0.168\\,c,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &v_{2}\\approx0.9\\,c,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &v_{2}\\approx0.184\\,c.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\beta_2 = 0.9c"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &M_0\\approx12.12\\,\\text{g},\\quad V\\approx0.168\\,c,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &v_{2}\\approx0.9\\,c,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &v_{2}\\approx0.184\\,c.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\beta_2 = 0.185c \\, \\text{or} \\, \\beta_2 = 0.151c"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Solving for the final rest mass m in terms of m₀ and v\n\nRearrange equation (2):\n  m₀ c² = γ m c (c + v)\nSolve for m:\n  m = (m₀ c²) / [γ c (c + v)]\n    = m₀ / [γ (1 + v/c)].           (3)\n\nRecall that γ = 1/√(1 – v²/c²). Substitute this in:\n  m = m₀ √(1 – v²/c²) / (1 + v/c).        (4)\n\nA little algebra will simplify (4) further. Write the square root as:\n  √(1 – v²/c²) = √[(1 – v/c)(1 + v/c)].\nThen:\n  m = m₀ √[(1 – v/c)(1 + v/c)] / (1 + v/c)\n    = m₀ √(1 – v/c) / √(1 + v/c).\n\nThus we obtain:\n  m = m₀ √[(1 – v/c)/(1 + v/c)].         (5)\n\nStep 4. Verification\n\nWhen v = 0, note that\n  m = m₀ √[(1 – 0)/(1 + 0)] = m₀,\nwhich is consistent with the initial condition.\n\nFinal Answer\n\nThus, the rest mass m of the flashlight when it has recoiled to a speed v (as measured in its original rest frame) is given by:\n\n  \\[\n\\boxed{ m = m_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}} }\n\\]", "final_answers": ["m = m_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "m = m_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}", "expr2": "m = m_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{c - v}{c + v}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "m*sqrt((c - v)/(c + v))", "expr2": "m*sqrt((c - v)/(c + v))"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

In what follows we choose the sign conventions so that the Lorentz force provides the required centripetal force. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Find B in Terms of q, R, m, and ω\n\nFor uniform circular motion, the centripetal acceleration is provided entirely by the magnetic force. In the lab frame the speed is constant:\n  v = R ω.\nThe magnitude of the centripetal force is\n\n  F_cent = m v²/R = m R ω².\nThe magnetic force on a charge q moving with speed v in a magnetic field B (with v ⊥ B) is\n\n  F_mag = q v B.\nEquating these (taking the proper sign so that the force has the right direction) we have\n  m R ω² = q R ω B.\nCancel R (assuming R ≠ 0) and one factor of ω (assuming ω ≠ 0) to obtain\n\n  B = (m ω)/(q).\nThus, one acceptable answer is\n\n  B = mω/q.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Find u′₀ for a Boosted Observer\n\nIn the lab frame the particle moves on a circle. A convenient parameterization of its position is\n  x(t) = R cos(ω t), y(t) = R sin(ω t).\nThe corresponding velocity is\n  vₓ = –R ω sin(ω t), v_y = R ω cos(ω t).\nThe 4–velocity is defined by\n  u^μ = (γ, γ vₓ, γ v_y, 0),\nwhere\n\n  γ ≡ 1/√[1 – (v²/c²)]  with  v = R ω.\n(Here and below we keep c explicitly when needed; you may set c = 1 if you wish.)\n\nNow consider an observer moving with constant velocity βc along (say) the x–axis relative to the lab frame. The corresponding Lorentz boost is characterized by\n  γ_β = 1/√(1 – β²).\nUnder a boost in the x–direction the time component of the 4–velocity transforms as\n  u′₀ = γ_β (u^0 – β u^1).\nSince in the lab frame we have\n  u^0 = γ  and  u^1 = γ (–R ω sin(ω t)),\nwe find\n  u′₀ = γ_β [γ – β (–γ R ω sin(ω t))]\n      = γ_β γ [1 + β R ω sin(ω t)].\nOften one wishes to express the answer in terms of the particle’s proper time τ; since dt/dτ = γ we have t = t(τ). It is then acceptable to write\n\n  u′₀(τ) = γ_β γ [1 + β R ω sin(ω t(τ))].\nThis shows that even though the speed in the lab frame is constant, the boosted observer sees a time–component (that is, an energy factor) that varies in time.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Compute du⁰/dτ and dp⁰/dτ and Comment on the Energy Change\n\nIn the lab frame the speed is constant (and so is γ). Hence,\n  u^0 = γ   is constant,\nand therefore\n  du^0/dτ = 0.\nSince the particle’s 4–momentum is given by\n  p^μ = m u^μ,\nit follows directly that\n  dp^0/dτ = m (du^0/dτ) = 0.\nThus, in the lab frame the energy of the particle (p⁰, up to the factor m and in appropriate units) is constant – which of course is expected since the magnetic field does no work.\n\nThe apparent paradox is resolved by noting that energy is not an invariant quantity; it depends on the frame. In the frame of the boosted observer, the particle’s energy (and the corresponding zero‐component of the 4–momentum) is not constant. In that frame an electric field appears (due to the Lorentz transformation of the electromagnetic field) and gives rise to a non–zero d(u′₀)/dτ. However, in the particle’s rest frame (and equally in the lab frame for the entire process) no work is done by the magnetic force. Thus, the change in energy observed by a moving observer is entirely due to the fact that the energy and momentum mix under Lorentz transformations and that the external fields (as seen in that frame) do work even though they come purely from a magnetic field in the lab frame.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) B = m ω/q.\n\n(b) In a boost along the x–axis the particle’s time–component of 4–velocity is\n  u′₀ = γ_β γ [1 + β R ω sin(ω t)],\nor, equivalently,\n  u′₀(τ)= γ_β γ [1 + β R ω sin(ω t(τ))].\n\n(c) Since u^0 = γ is constant in the lab frame, \n  du^0/dτ = 0  and  dp^0/dτ = 0.\nThus, the magnetic field does no work in the lab frame; the change in energy measured by the moving observer is a consequence of the Lorentz transformation (and the corresponding appearance of an electric field in that frame).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Latex Boxed Format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &B = \\frac{m\\omega}{q},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &u'_0 = \\gamma_\\beta\\gamma\\Bigl[1 + \\beta\\,R\\omega\\,\\sin(\\omega t)\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\frac{du^0}{d\\tau}=0,\\quad\\frac{dp^0}{d\\tau}=0.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &B = \\frac{m\\omega}{q},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &u'_0 = \\gamma_\\beta\\gamma\\Bigl[1 + \\beta\\,R\\omega\\,\\sin(\\omega t)\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\frac{du^0}{d\\tau}=0,\\quad\\frac{dp^0}{d\\tau}=0.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &B = \\frac{m\\omega}{q},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &u'_0 = \\gamma_\\beta\\gamma\\Bigl[1 + \\beta\\,R\\omega\\,\\sin(\\omega t)\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\frac{du^0}{d\\tau}=0,\\quad\\frac{dp^0}{d\\tau}=0.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "B = \\frac{m \\omega}{q} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{R \\omega}{c} \\right)^2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &B = \\frac{m\\omega}{q},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &u'_0 = \\gamma_\\beta\\gamma\\Bigl[1 + \\beta\\,R\\omega\\,\\sin(\\omega t)\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\frac{du^0}{d\\tau}=0,\\quad\\frac{dp^0}{d\\tau}=0.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "u_0' = \\gamma \\gamma_u [c + \\beta u \\sin(\\omega \\gamma_u \\tau + \\varphi)]"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &B = \\frac{m\\omega}{q},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &u'_0 = \\gamma_\\beta\\gamma\\Bigl[1 + \\beta\\,R\\omega\\,\\sin(\\omega t)\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\frac{du^0}{d\\tau}=0,\\quad\\frac{dp^0}{d\\tau}=0.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{du_0'}{d \\tau} = \\frac{Rq^2 B^2}{m} \\frac{\\beta}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} \\cos \\left(\\frac{qBT}{m} + \\varphi \\right)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &B = \\frac{m\\omega}{q},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &u'_0 = \\gamma_\\beta\\gamma\\Bigl[1 + \\beta\\,R\\omega\\,\\sin(\\omega t)\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\frac{du^0}{d\\tau}=0,\\quad\\frac{dp^0}{d\\tau}=0.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{dE}{d \\tau} = c \\frac{dp_0'}{d \\tau}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Moment of Inertia of a Thin Rod about Its Center of Mass\n\nA uniform thin rod of mass m and length l has a linear mass density \n  λ = m/l.\nChoose a coordinate x along the rod with the origin at its center (that is, from –l/2 to l/2). By definition the moment of inertia is\n\n  I = ∫₋(l/2)^(l/2) x² dm \n    = ∫₋(l/2)^(l/2) x² (λ dx)\n    = (m/l) ∫₋(l/2)^(l/2) x² dx.\n\nSince x² is an even function we can write\n\n  ∫₋(l/2)^(l/2) x² dx = 2∫₀^(l/2) x² dx\n    = 2·[x³/3]₀^(l/2)\n    = 2 ( (l/2)³/3)\n    = 2 (l³/24)\n    = l³/12.\n\nThus the moment of inertia becomes\n\n  I = (m/l) · (l³/12) = ml²/12.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nPart (b). Lagrangian and Equations of Motion for the Rod–Tube System\n\nWe now consider the system shown. A massless (negligible mass) tube is pivoted at one end and free to rotate in the horizontal plane. A thin rod of mass M and length l is free to slide without friction along the tube. (The tube acts as a narrow slot.) Notice that the only kinetic energy is that of the rod, which, however, can both translate and “rotate” in the sense that its alignment (which we assume is forced to lie along the tube) rotates with the tube.\n\nIt is most convenient to use “polar‐type” coordinates in the horizontal plane. Let:\n  r be the distance from the pivot to the center of mass of the rod,\n  φ be the rotation angle of the tube (which fixes the orientation of the rod as well).\n\nThen there are two contributions to the kinetic energy T of the rod:\n\n1. The translational kinetic energy of its center of mass:\n  T_trans = ½ M (ṙ² + r² φ̇²).\n\n2. The rotational kinetic energy about its center of mass. From part (a) the moment of inertia of the rod about its center is I_cm = M l²/12, and since the rod must rotate with the tube (its axis remains aligned with the tube) the angular speed of the rod about its center is φ̇. Therefore,\n  T_rot = ½ (M l²/12) φ̇².\n\nSince the tube is horizontal (and we choose the zero of potential energy conveniently) the potential energy is zero: V = 0. Thus the Lagrangian is\n\n  L = T – V = T.\n\nCollecting the pieces we have\n\n  L = ½M (ṙ² + r² φ̇²) + ½ (M l²/12) φ̇².\n\nIt is sometimes convenient to group the φ̇² terms. In that case\n\n  L = ½M ṙ² + ½ M (r² + l²/12) φ̇².\n\nNow we write Lagrange’s equations.\n\nFor the coordinate r:\n  ∂L/∂ṙ = M ṙ   => d/dt (M ṙ) = M r̈.\n  ∂L/∂r = ½ M (2r) φ̇² = M r φ̇².\nThus the r–equation is\n  M r̈ – M r φ̇² = 0   or  r̈ = r φ̇².\n\nFor the coordinate φ:\n  ∂L/∂φ̇ = M (r² + l²/12) φ̇  (φ does not appear explicitly in L, so ∂L/∂φ = 0).\nThus\n  d/dt [ M (r² + l²/12) φ̇ ] = 0.\nIn other words, the generalized momentum conjugate to φ is conserved:\n  M (r² + l²/12) φ̇ = constant = M (l²/12) ω₀    [if we set the constant from the initial conditions, see (c) below].\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nPart (c). Instability of the Centered Position and Long‐Time Motion\n\nInitially the rod is “centered over the pivot” (so that r = 0) and the tube rotates with angular speed φ̇ = ω₀. (At r = 0 the entire kinetic energy is “rotational” in the sense that the rod rotates around its center with speed ω₀ and the effective rotational inertia is only that of the rod about its center, I_cm = M l²/12.) This point is an equilibrium point for the radial equation. However, its stability is determined by the effective potential.\n\nNotice that the conserved angular momentum (about the pivot) is\n\n  L_phi = M (r² + l²/12) φ̇.\nInitially when r = 0 we have\n  L_phi = M (l²/12) ω₀.\nThus for any later time,\n  φ̇ = [M (l²/12) ω₀] / [M(r² + l²/12)] = (l² ω₀/12)/(r² + l²/12).\n\nOne may view the radial equation r̈ = r φ̇² as coming from an effective potential. Writing the conservation of energy in the r–direction\n\n  E = ½ M ṙ² + U_eff(r),\nwith\n  U_eff(r) = ½M (r² + l²/12) φ̇² = ½M [r² + (l²/12)] * [ (l² ω₀/12)/(r² + l²/12) ]².\nIt is clear that at r = 0 the effective potential attains a maximum because if one perturbs r slightly positive then the centrifugal “force” r φ̇² acts to push r further outward. (Indeed, a short expansion for small r shows r̈ ≈ ω₀² r, so that any small r grows exponentially.) In that sense the initially centered state (r = 0) is an unstable equilibrium.\n\nWhat happens if the rod is given a slight displacement? Conservation of angular momentum implies that as r increases the angular speed φ̇ must decrease according to\n\n  φ̇ = (l² ω₀/12)/(r² + l²/12).\n\nMoreover, energy conservation tells us that the loss in “rotational” energy (about the pivot) goes into radial kinetic energy. In fact, the total kinetic energy is conserved. Initially (with r = 0 and ṙ = 0) the energy is\n\n  E_initial = ½ M (r² + l²/12) ω₀²|_(r=0) = ½ (M l²/12) ω₀².\nAfter the rod has moved very far from the pivot (r ≫ l) the term l²/12 is negligible compared to r² and the angular kinetic energy becomes very small. Thus, at very long times almost all of the energy lies in ṙ. That is,\n  ½ M ṙ² ≈ ½ (M l²/12) ω₀²,\nso that the asymptotic radial speed is\n  ṙ → (ω₀ l)/√12.\nSimultaneously, since\n  φ̇ = (l² ω₀/12)/(r² + l²/12) ≈ (l² ω₀/12)/r²   for large r,\nthe angular speed decays as 1/r².\n\nThus, if the rod is slightly disturbed from its unstable equilibrium (r = 0) it will “run away” radially with eventually a constant speed, while its angular motion slows down.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer\n\n(a) The moment of inertia of a thin rod about its center is\n\n  I = ml²/12.\n\n(b) Using r (the distance from the pivot to the rod’s center) and φ (the tube’s rotation angle) the Lagrangian is\n  L = ½M ṙ² + ½M (r² + l²/12) φ̇².\nThe Lagrange equations are:\n  (i) r̈ = r φ̇²   \n  (ii) d/dt[(r² + l²/12) φ̇] = 0  (i.e. M (r² + l²/12) φ̇ is constant).\n\n(c) When r = 0 the effective moment of inertia is M(l²/12), so that the state r = 0 (with φ̇ = ω₀) is an unstable equilibrium. A slight displacement causes the rod to accelerate outward. Conservation of angular momentum forces\n  φ̇ = (l² ω₀/12)/(r² + l²/12)\nso that at long times (r ≫ l) the rod’s radial speed tends to\n  ṙ → (ω₀ l)/√12,\nand its angular speed decays as\n  φ̇ → (l² ω₀)/(12r²) → 0.\n\nThus these results fully answer the problem.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer in LaTeX Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &I = \\frac{ml^2}{12}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &L = \\frac{1}{2}M\\dot r^2 + \\frac{1}{2}M\\Bigl(r^2+\\frac{l^2}{12}\\Bigr)\\dot\\varphi^2,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{with equations}:\\quad r^{\\ddot{}} = r\\dot\\varphi^2,\\quad \\frac{d}{dt}\\Bigl[\nM\\Bigl(r^2+\\frac{l^2}{12}\\Bigr)\\dot\\varphi\\Bigr] = 0.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{The equilibrium }r=0\\text{ is unstable.

For example, writing\n  J_tot = πk √(2m)/(–E)^(1/2),\none obtains\n  dJ_tot/dE = πk √(2m)·(1/2)(–E)^–3/2   (and the minus signs cancel appropriately),\nso that after a little algebra one finds\n  τ = πk √(m/–2E³).\nThus, the period of the r–motion equals that of the angular (θ) motion.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The canonical momenta are \n  p_r = mṙ,  p_θ = m r²θ̇,\nwith p_θ constant.\n\n(b) One may show that\n  J_r + J_θ = ∮ p_r dr + ∮ p_θ dθ\n       = ∮ (k/r) dt.\n\n(c) In fact one may demonstrate that\n  J_r + J_θ = √[–(2π² m k²)/E].\n\n(d) Finally, it follows that\n  τ = (d/dE)(J_r + J_θ) = πk √(m/–2E³).\n\nThus, an acceptable final answer is \n\n            \n\n  \\[\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &p_r = m\\dot{r},\\quad p_\\theta = m r^2\\dot{\\theta},\\quad\\mbox{with } p_\\theta \\mbox{ constant};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &J_r + J_\\theta = \\oint p_r\\,dr + \\oint p_\\theta\\,d\\theta = \\oint \\frac{k}{r}\\,dt;\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &J_r + J_\\theta = \\sqrt{\\frac{-2\\pi^2 m k^2}{E}};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &\\tau = \\pi k \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{-2E^3}}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\\]\n\nAny answer which is mathematically equivalent is correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &p_r = m\\dot{r},\\quad p_\\theta = m r^2\\dot{\\theta},\\quad\\mbox{with } p_\\theta \\mbox{ constant};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &J_r + J_\\theta = \\oint p_r\\,dr + \\oint p_\\theta\\,d\\theta = \\oint \\frac{k}{r}\\,dt;\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &J_r + J_\\theta = \\sqrt{\\frac{-2\\pi^2 m k^2}{E}};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &\\tau = \\pi k \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{-2E^3}}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &p_r = m\\dot{r},\\quad p_\\theta = m r^2\\dot{\\theta},\\quad\\mbox{with } p_\\theta \\mbox{ constant};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &J_r + J_\\theta = \\oint p_r\\,dr + \\oint p_\\theta\\,d\\theta = \\oint \\frac{k}{r}\\,dt;\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &J_r + J_\\theta = \\sqrt{\\frac{-2\\pi^2 m k^2}{E}};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &\\tau = \\pi k \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{-2E^3}}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "p_r = m \\dot{r}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &p_r = m\\dot{r},\\quad p_\\theta = m r^2\\dot{\\theta},\\quad\\mbox{with } p_\\theta \\mbox{ constant};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &J_r + J_\\theta = \\oint p_r\\,dr + \\oint p_\\theta\\,d\\theta = \\oint \\frac{k}{r}\\,dt;\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &J_r + J_\\theta = \\sqrt{\\frac{-2\\pi^2 m k^2}{E}};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &\\tau = \\pi k \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{-2E^3}}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "p_\\theta = m r^2 \\dot{\\theta}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "mechanics/1_81", "solution": "We start with the equation of motion for a mass m subject to a linear restoring force –Kx and a linear resistive (damping) force –Rv:\n\n  m x¨ + R x˙ + K x = 0.\n\nThe characteristic (auxiliary) equation is\n\n  m r² + R r + K = 0.\n\nIts roots are\n\n  r = (–R ± √(R² – 4mK))⁄(2m).\n\nThere are three cases:\n\n1. Under‐damping (R² < 4mK): the roots are complex conjugate,\n  r = –R/(2m) ± iω, with ω = √(4mK – R²)/(2m).\n  The solution is oscillatory with an envelope decaying as exp(–Rt/(2m)).\n\n2. Critical damping (R² = 4mK): the two roots coincide,\n  r1 = r2 = –R/(2m) = –√(K/m)  (since R_c = 2√(mK)).\n  The general solution is\n   x(t) = (A + Bt)e^(–√(K/m) t).\n\n3. Overdamping (R² > 4mK): the roots are real and distinct,\n  r1 = (–R + √(R² – 4mK))/(2m),  r2 = (–R – √(R² – 4mK))/(2m).\n  Since r1 > r2, the long‑time decay will be governed by the slower decaying term with exponent r1.\n\nNow, for arbitrary initial conditions the overall rate of decay is determined by the slowest decaying term. In the underdamped case the envelope decays as exp(–Rt/(2m)). In the overdamped case, if both modes are present then the slower rate is r1 (which is less negative than r2). One may check that the best overall (i.e. the fastest decay for any initial conditions) is obtained when the system is critically damped; indeed, setting R = R_c = 2√(mK) makes\n  x(t) = (A + Bt)e^(–√(K/m) t),\nso that the envelope decays as exp(–√(K/m)t).\n\nThus, when we ask “for fixed K and arbitrary initial conditions, what value of R gives the most rapid approach to equilibrium?” the answer is that the critical damping value is best:\n\n  R_c = 2√(mK).\n\nWhat about trying to do “better” than critical damping by choosing very special initial conditions when R ≠ R_c?\n\nConsider first the overdamped case (R > 2√(mK)). Its general solution is a linear combination of two exponentials,\n  x(t) = A e^(r1t) + B e^(r2t),\nwhere r1 is the slow mode (less negative) and r2 is the fast mode (more negative). It is possible to choose initial data so that the coefficient A of the slow (r1) mode vanishes. In that case the solution is given solely by the fast mode and decays like e^(r2t), which for this specific initial condition decays more rapidly than the generic solution. However, note that the best decay rate that one can “pick out” in this way is exactly the rate of the r2 mode for that R. In no case does one obtain a decay faster than what is achieved by the critically damped system, since the critical damping is, in a sense, “optimally balanced” over all (arbitrary) initial conditions.\n\nNow consider the underdamped case (R < 2√(mK)). There one always has oscillatory behavior and the decay rate (the exponential envelope) is exp(–Rt/(2m)). Even if one were to choose initial conditions in a “special” way (which may, for example, minimize the amplitude of the oscillations), the decay envelope is fixed by the real part –R/(2m) of the complex roots. In particular, since for R < R_c we have R/(2m) < √(K/m), no choice of nontrivial (nonzero) initial conditions can beat the optimal decay of the critically damped system.\n\nThus, to summarize:\n\n1. For arbitrary initial conditions the most rapid approach to equilibrium is achieved at critical damping:\n  R_c = 2√(mK).\n\n2. In the overdamped case (R > R_c), one may choose initial conditions that exactly cancel the slow mode so that the solution decays according to the faster rate associated with r2. However, this “special” initial condition does not allow the system to decay any faster than the critically damped case does for arbitrary initial data.\n\n3. In the underdamped case (R < R_c) the oscillatory nature (and the associated decay envelope exp(–Rt/(2m))) means that no nontrivial choice of initial conditions can produce a decay rate faster than the optimal rate of the critically damped case.\n\nThus, aside from the trivial equilibrium initial condition x = 0, v = 0, one cannot achieve a more rapid approach to equilibrium than with the critical damping strength R_c = 2√(mK) if one is considering the system’s behavior in a general sense.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{R_c = 2\\sqrt{mK}. \\text{ For arbitrary initial conditions the fastest decay is achieved at } R=R_c; \\text{ although in the overdamped case one may choose initial conditions to eliminate the slow mode, no nontrivial choice for either } R<R_c \\text{ or } R>R_c \\text{ will yield a decay rate exceeding that of the critically damped system.} } \\]", "final_answers": ["R_c = 2\\sqrt{mK}. \\text{ For arbitrary initial conditions the fastest decay is achieved at } R=R_c; \\text{ although in the overdamped case one may choose initial conditions to eliminate the slow mode, no nontrivial choice for either } R<R_c \\text{ or } R>R_c \\text{ will yield a decay rate exceeding that of the critically damped system.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "R_c = 2\\sqrt{mK}. \\text{ For arbitrary initial conditions the fastest decay is achieved at } R=R_c; \\text{ although in the overdamped case one may choose initial conditions to eliminate the slow mode, no nontrivial choice for either } R<R_c \\text{ or } R>R_c \\text{ will yield a decay rate exceeding that of the critically damped system.}", "expr2": "R_c = 2\\sqrt{Km}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "mechanics/1_28", "solution": "We will show that the motion of the particle can be described in two parts. In the first part the particle “slides” on the sphere under the influence of gravity until it loses contact at a well‐known point, and in the second part it follows a free‐fall (projectile) trajectory until it hits the horizontal plane.\n\nBelow we explain step‐by‐step how one obtains an answer that is equivalent to the boxed answer at the end.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Setting Up the Geometry\n\nAssume that the sphere “rests on” the horizontal plane z = 0. Then if the sphere has radius R the only point of contact is at the bottom. It is most convenient to choose coordinates so that the center of the sphere is at (0, 0, R). (Then the bottom of the sphere touches the plane at (0, 0, 0) and the top is at (0, 0, 2R).) A natural parametrization of points on the sphere is\n\n  x = R sinθ cosφ, y = R sinθ sinφ, z = R + R cosθ,\n\nwith the polar angle θ measured from the “up‐direction” (i.e. θ = 0 at the top of the sphere).\n\nSince the particle starts at the top, we have initially θ = 0. We will assume (without loss of generality) that the motion remains in the φ = 0 plane so that the coordinates become\n\n  x = R sinθ, y = 0, z = R + R cosθ.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. The Motion on the Sphere\n\nBecause the sphere is smooth and the motion is frictionless, the only forces are gravity and the normal force. Energy conservation tells us that after descending an angle θ the particle’s speed is given by\n\n  ½mv² = mg [ (height at start) – (height at θ) ].\n\nThe particle starts at the top at z = 2R and at a general position on the sphere the height is z = R + R cosθ. Hence,\n\n  ½mv² = mg [2R − (R + R cosθ)] = mgR (1 − cosθ).\n\nThat is,\n  v² = 2gR (1−cosθ).\n\nNow, as long as the particle is in contact with the sphere the normal force N (which we do not need to compute explicitly) is determined by the radial (centripetal) component of the weight. Writing Newton’s second law in the radial (normal) direction (pointing from the center to the particle) we get\n\n  mg cosθ − N = m(v²/R).\n\nThe particle will lose contact when the normal force vanishes, i.e. when N = 0. Thus the separation (or “departure”) condition is\n\n  mg cosθ = m(v²/R).\n\nSubstitute the above expression for v²:\n\n  mg cosθ = m[2gR (1−cosθ)]/R  ⟹  g cosθ = 2g (1−cosθ).\n\nDividing by g and rearranging,\n\n  cosθ = 2 (1−cosθ) ⟹ 3 cosθ = 2 ⟹ cosθ = 2/3.\n\nThus, the particle loses contact with the sphere when\n\n  θ_c = arccos(2/3).\n\nAt that moment the speed is\n\n  v_c = √[2gR(1 − (2/3))] = √(2gR/3).\n\nThe position at separation is obtained by plugging θ_c into the sphere’s parametrization. Since\n\n  sinθ_c = √(1−cos²θ_c) = √(1 − 4/9) = √(5/9) = (√5)/3,\n  cosθ_c = 2/3,\nwe have\n\n  x_c = R sinθ_c = (R√5)/3,\n  z_c = R + R cosθ_c = R + (2R)/3 = (5R)/3.\n\nThe tangent direction on the sphere at departure is given (up to a positive scale factor) by differentiating with respect to θ:\n  d/dθ (R sinθ) = R cosθ (in x)\n  d/dθ (R + R cosθ) = −R sinθ (in z).\n\nAt θ = θ_c the (non‐unit) tangent vector is therefore\n\n  (R cosθ_c, −R sinθ_c) = (R(2/3), −R(√5/3)).\n\nNotice that its magnitude is R so that the corresponding unit tangent vector is\n\n  t̂_c = (2/3, −(√5)/3).\n\nThus, at separation the velocity has the magnitude\n\n  v_c = √(2gR/3)\n\nand is directed along\n\n  v̂_c = (2/3, 0, −(√5)/3).\n\nIn summary, from the top until θ = θ_c the particle remains on the sphere. Its (spherically–parametrized) position is\n\n  r(θ) = (R sinθ, 0, R + R cosθ), 0 ≤ θ ≤ θ_c,\nwith speed v(θ) = √[2gR(1−cosθ)].\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. The Projectile (Free–Fall) Phase\n\nWhen the particle leaves the sphere at the point\n\n  r_c = ((R√5)/3, 0, (5R)/3)\nwith speed\n\n  v_c = √(2gR/3)\nin the direction\n\n  v̂_c = (2/3, 0, −(√5)/3),\nit then follows a projectile (ballistic) trajectory under the sole influence of gravity.\n\nIt is convenient to choose t = 0 at the moment of separation. Then the initial conditions for the projectile motion are\n\n  At t = 0:\n   x(0) = (R√5)/3, z(0) = (5R)/3,\n   v_x(0) = (2/3) √(2gR/3), v_z(0) = −(√5)/3 √(2gR/3).\n\nUnder constant gravity (with acceleration −g in the z–direction) the motion is given by\n\n  x(t) = (R√5)/3 + (2/3)√(2gR/3) · t,\n  z(t) = (5R)/3 − (√5)/3 √(2gR/3) · t − (1/2)g t².\n\nThe particle will strike the horizontal plane when z(t) = 0. One may solve the quadratic equation\n\n  (1/2)gt² + (√5/3)√(2gR/3)·t − (5R)/3 = 0\nfor the positive time t = t_f at which the particle hits the plane.\n\nOne finds, after a short calculation (details omitted), that the time-of-flight is\n\n  t_f = [√(R/g)/(3√3)] (10 − √10).\n\n(Any algebraically equivalent form is acceptable.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThus, an acceptable answer is as follows. The motion is described in two parts:\n\n1. While in contact with the sphere (0 ≤ θ ≤ θ_c with θ_c = arccos(2/3)):\n  r(θ) = (R sinθ, 0, R + R cosθ),\nwith speed v(θ) = √[2gR(1 − cosθ)].\n\nThe departure point is\n  r_c = ((R√5)/3, 0, 5R/3)\nwith the particle leaving with speed\n  v_c = √(2gR/3)\nin the tangential direction\n  t̂_c = (2/3, 0, −(√5)/3).\n\n2. For t ≥ 0 after leaving the sphere the projectile motion is given by\n  x(t) = (R√5)/3 + (2/3) √(2gR/3) · t,\n  z(t) = (5R)/3 − (√5)/3 √(2gR/3) · t − (1/2) g t².\nThe particle strikes the plane z = 0 at time t_f = [√(R/g)/(3√3)] (10 − √10).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Boxed Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\textbf{On the sphere:}\\quad &\\vec r(\\theta)=\\bigl(R\\sin\\theta,\\,0,\\,R+R\\cos\\theta\\bigr),\\quad 0\\le\\theta\\le\\theta_c,\\quad v(\\theta)=\\sqrt{2gR(1-\\cos\\theta)},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\theta_c=\\arccos(2/3).\\\\[1mm]\n\\textbf{At separation:}\\quad &\\vec r_c=\\Bigl(\\frac{R\\sqrt{5}}3,\\,0,\\,\\frac{5R}{3}\\Bigr),\\quad v_c=\\sqrt{\\frac{2gR}{3}},\\quad \\hat{t}_c=\\Bigl(\\frac{2}{3},\\,0,\\,-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3}\\Bigr).\\\\[1mm]\n\\textbf{Projectile phase:}\\quad &x(t)=\\frac{R\\sqrt{5}}3+\\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{2gR}{3}}\\,t,\\\\[1mm]\n&z(t)=\\frac{5R}{3}-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{2gR}{3}}\\,t-\\tfrac{1}{2}gt^2,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{with }\\,t_f=\\frac{\\sqrt{R/g}}{3\\sqrt{3}}\\Bigl(10-\\sqrt{10}\\Bigr)\\,.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nAny answer that shows that the particle slides along the sphere until θ = arccos(2/3) (losing contact at (R√5/3,0,5R/3) with speed √(2gR/3) in the direction (2/3,0,–√5/3)) and then follows the above projectile motion until striking the plane is correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\textbf{On the sphere:}\\quad &\\vec r(\\theta)=\\bigl(R\\sin\\theta,\\,0,\\,R+R\\cos\\theta\\bigr),\\quad 0\\le\\theta\\le\\theta_c,\\quad v(\\theta)=\\sqrt{2gR(1-\\cos\\theta)},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\theta_c=\\arccos(2/3).\\\\[1mm]\n\\textbf{At separation:}\\quad &\\vec r_c=\\Bigl(\\frac{R\\sqrt{5}}3,\\,0,\\,\\frac{5R}{3}\\Bigr),\\quad v_c=\\sqrt{\\frac{2gR}{3}},\\quad \\hat{t}_c=\\Bigl(\\frac{2}{3},\\,0,\\,-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3}\\Bigr).\\\\[1mm]\n\\textbf{Projectile phase:}\\quad &x(t)=\\frac{R\\sqrt{5}}3+\\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{2gR}{3}}\\,t,\\\\[1mm]\n&z(t)=\\frac{5R}{3}-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{2gR}{3}}\\,t-\\tfrac{1}{2}gt^2,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{with }\\,t_f=\\frac{\\sqrt{R/g}}{3\\sqrt{3}}\\Bigl(10-\\sqrt{10}\\Bigr)\\,.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\textbf{On the sphere:}\\quad &\\vec r(\\theta)=\\bigl(R\\sin\\theta,\\,0,\\,R+R\\cos\\theta\\bigr),\\quad 0\\le\\theta\\le\\theta_c,\\quad v(\\theta)=\\sqrt{2gR(1-\\cos\\theta)},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\theta_c=\\arccos(2/3).\\\\[1mm]\n\\textbf{At separation:}\\quad &\\vec r_c=\\Bigl(\\frac{R\\sqrt{5}}3,\\,0,\\,\\frac{5R}{3}\\Bigr),\\quad v_c=\\sqrt{\\frac{2gR}{3}},\\quad \\hat{t}_c=\\Bigl(\\frac{2}{3},\\,0,\\,-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3}\\Bigr).\\\\[1mm]\n\\textbf{Projectile phase:}\\quad &x(t)=\\frac{R\\sqrt{5}}3+\\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{2gR}{3}}\\,t,\\\\[1mm]\n&z(t)=\\frac{5R}{3}-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{2gR}{3}}\\,t-\\tfrac{1}{2}gt^2,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{with }\\,t_f=\\frac{\\sqrt{R/g}}{3\\sqrt{3}}\\Bigl(10-\\sqrt{10}\\Bigr)\\,.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\theta = 48.2^\\circ"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\textbf{On the sphere:}\\quad &\\vec r(\\theta)=\\bigl(R\\sin\\theta,\\,0,\\,R+R\\cos\\theta\\bigr),\\quad 0\\le\\theta\\le\\theta_c,\\quad v(\\theta)=\\sqrt{2gR(1-\\cos\\theta)},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\theta_c=\\arccos(2/3).\\\\[1mm]\n\\textbf{At separation:}\\quad &\\vec r_c=\\Bigl(\\frac{R\\sqrt{5}}3,\\,0,\\,\\frac{5R}{3}\\Bigr),\\quad v_c=\\sqrt{\\frac{2gR}{3}},\\quad \\hat{t}_c=\\Bigl(\\frac{2}{3},\\,0,\\,-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3}\\Bigr).\\\\[1mm]\n\\textbf{Projectile phase:}\\quad &x(t)=\\frac{R\\sqrt{5}}3+\\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{2gR}{3}}\\,t,\\\\[1mm]\n&z(t)=\\frac{5R}{3}-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{2gR}{3}}\\,t-\\tfrac{1}{2}gt^2,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{with }\\,t_f=\\frac{\\sqrt{R/g}}{3\\sqrt{3}}\\Bigl(10-\\sqrt{10}\\Bigr)\\,.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2gR}{3}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "mechanics/2_37", "solution": "We wish to study the small‐oscillation (vibration) frequencies of a charged particle of mass m and charge q moving in a three‐dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential\n  V₀(r) = (1/2) m ω₀² r²\nwith natural frequency ω₀, while the particle is subjected to uniform magnetic and electric fields. (We assume here that the magnetic field is “static” and uniform, and that the electric field is likewise uniform.) The presence of a uniform electric field does not alter the oscillation frequencies (it merely shifts the equilibrium position), so the essential new feature comes from the magnetic field.\n\nFor definiteness we choose a coordinate system so that the magnetic field is along the z‐axis,\n  B = B ẑ.\nThe minimal‐coupling substitution means that the momentum in the Hamiltonian is replaced by (p – qA) where a convenient gauge choice (the “symmetric gauge”) is\n  A = (1/2) B × r = (–B y/2, B x/2, 0).\n\nThus the Hamiltonian becomes\n  H = (1/(2m)) [p – qA]² + (1/2) m ω₀² r² – q φ\nwhere φ is the scalar potential corresponding to the uniform electric field E. (For example, if E = E ẑ, then φ = –E z.) Notice that a linear (in r) term in φ will simply shift the equilibrium; near the minimum of the effective potential the quadratic part is the same and the frequencies remain unchanged (although the eigenfunctions are centered at a new equilibrium point).\n\nThus we concentrate on the effect of the magnetic field. In our system the z motion decouples because A has no z–component. Therefore the motion along z is governed solely by\n  H_z = p_z²/(2m) + (1/2) m ω₀² z²,\nand so oscillates at the unperturbed frequency\n  ω_z = ω₀.\nThe interesting modification appears in the (x,y) plane. One finds that the equations of motion in the x–y directions lead to “normal modes” which are well known from the study of a two‐dimensional harmonic oscillator subject to a perpendicular magnetic field. (See, for instance, the treatment of a charged oscillator in a magnetic field in Chapter 7 of many quantum mechanics texts.) One obtains two eigenfrequencies which are expressed in terms of the “cyclotron frequency”\n  ω_c = qB/m.\nA standard result is that the planar frequencies are given by\n\n  ω₊ = √(ω₀² + (ω_c/2)²) + ω_c/2     (1)\n  ω₋ = √(ω₀² + (ω_c/2)²) − ω_c/2     (2)\n\nSometimes these are written in the equivalent form\n\n  ω_{±} = ½ [√(4 ω₀² + ω_c²) ± ω_c].\n\nThus, the oscillator has the three vibration frequencies\n\n  (1) In the x–y plane:\n   ω₊ = √(ω₀² + (ω_c/2)²) + ω_c/2,\n   ω₋ = √(ω₀² + (ω_c/2)²) − ω_c/2,\n  (2) Along z:\n   ω_z = ω₀.\n\nIn many physical situations (especially in quantum mechanics when looking at the spectrum) one then writes the energy as a sum of oscillator levels:\n  E = ℏ ω₊ (n₊ + ½) + ℏ ω₋ (n₋ + ½) + ℏ ω₀ (n_z + ½)\nwith quantum numbers n₊, n₋, n_z = 0, 1, 2, … The effect of a uniform electric field (say, E = E ẑ) is simply to replace z by z – z₀ with z₀ = qE/(m ω₀²); thus the frequencies remain unchanged.\n\nLet us now discuss two limits:\n\n-----------------------\nWeak Magnetic Field Limit (ω_c ≪ ω₀):\n\nExpand the square root in (1) and (2) with ω_c/2 ≪ ω₀:\n  √(ω₀² + (ω_c/2)²) ≈ ω₀ + (1/2)(ω_c/2)²/ω₀ = ω₀ + ω_c²/(8 ω₀).\nThus, the frequencies become\n  ω₊ ≈ ω₀ + ω_c/2 + ω_c²/(8ω₀),\n  ω₋ ≈ ω₀ − ω_c/2 + ω_c²/(8ω₀).\nThat is, the degeneracy of the two transverse directions is broken by the magnetic field by ± ω_c/2 to first order.\n\n-----------------------\nStrong Magnetic Field Limit (ω_c ≫ ω₀):\n\nIn this limit we have\n  √(ω₀² + (ω_c/2)²) ≈ ω_c/2 √[1 + 4ω₀²/ω_c²] ≈ ω_c/2 (1 + 2ω₀²/ω_c²),\nso that\n  ω₊ ≈ ω_c/2 (1 + 2ω₀²/ω_c²) + ω_c/2 = ω_c (1 + ω₀²/ω_c²) ≈ ω_c + ω₀²/ω_c,\n  ω₋ ≈ ω_c/2 (1 + 2ω₀²/ω_c²) − ω_c/2 = ω₀²/ω_c.\nThus one mode (ω₊) becomes essentially the cyclotron frequency (with a small correction), whereas the other (ω₋) becomes very soft, vanishing like ω₀²/ω_c as ω_c increases.\n\n-----------------------\nFinal Answer:\n\nThus, for a charged particle in an isotropic oscillator potential in the presence of a uniform magnetic field B (taken along the z–direction) and any uniform electric field (which only shifts the equilibrium), the oscillation (vibration) frequencies are\n\n  (1) In the x–y plane:\n   ω₊ = √(ω₀² + (ω_c/2)²) + ω_c/2,\n   ω₋ = √(ω₀² + (ω_c/2)²) − ω_c/2   with ω_c = qB/m,\n  (2) Along z:\n   ω_z = ω₀.\n\nIn the weak-field limit (ω_c ≪ ω₀), these reduce to\n  ω₊ ≈ ω₀ + ω_c/2  and ω₋ ≈ ω₀ − ω_c/2,\nwhile in the strong-field limit (ω_c ≫ ω₀) they become\n  ω₊ ≈ ω_c  and ω₋ ≈ ω₀²/ω_c.\n\nFinally, note that the uniform electric field (if any) shifts the equilibrium position but does not change these vibration frequencies.\n\nThe final answer is therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega_{\\pm} &= \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 + \\Bigl(\\frac{qB}{2m}\\Bigr)^2} \\pm \\frac{qB}{2m}, \\quad\\text{(in the \\(xy\\) plane)}\\\\[1mm]\n\\omega_z &= \\omega_0,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Weak field: }&\\quad \\omega_{+} \\approx \\omega_0 + \\frac{qB}{2m},\\quad \\omega_{-} \\approx \\omega_0 - \\frac{qB}{2m},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Strong field: }&\\quad \\omega_{+} \\approx \\frac{qB}{m},\\quad \\omega_{-} \\approx \\frac{\\omega_0^2 m}{qB}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nThis completes the solution.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega_{\\pm} &= \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 + \\Bigl(\\frac{qB}{2m}\\Bigr)^2} \\pm \\frac{qB}{2m}, \\quad\\text{(in the \\(xy\\) plane)}\\\\[1mm]\n\\omega_z &= \\omega_0,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Weak field: }&\\quad \\omega_{+} \\approx \\omega_0 + \\frac{qB}{2m},\\quad \\omega_{-} \\approx \\omega_0 - \\frac{qB}{2m},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Strong field: }&\\quad \\omega_{+} \\approx \\frac{qB}{m},\\quad \\omega_{-} \\approx \\frac{\\omega_0^2 m}{qB}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega_{\\pm} &= \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 + \\Bigl(\\frac{qB}{2m}\\Bigr)^2} \\pm \\frac{qB}{2m}, \\quad\\text{(in the \\(xy\\) plane)}\\\\[1mm]\n\\omega_z &= \\omega_0,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Weak field: }&\\quad \\omega_{+} \\approx \\omega_0 + \\frac{qB}{2m},\\quad \\omega_{-} \\approx \\omega_0 - \\frac{qB}{2m},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Strong field: }&\\quad \\omega_{+} \\approx \\frac{qB}{m},\\quad \\omega_{-} \\approx \\frac{\\omega_0^2 m}{qB}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\omega_0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega_{\\pm} &= \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 + \\Bigl(\\frac{qB}{2m}\\Bigr)^2} \\pm \\frac{qB}{2m}, \\quad\\text{(in the \\(xy\\) plane)}\\\\[1mm]\n\\omega_z &= \\omega_0,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Weak field: }&\\quad \\omega_{+} \\approx \\omega_0 + \\frac{qB}{2m},\\quad \\omega_{-} \\approx \\omega_0 - \\frac{qB}{2m},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Strong field: }&\\quad \\omega_{+} \\approx \\frac{qB}{m},\\quad \\omega_{-} \\approx \\frac{\\omega_0^2 m}{qB}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\omega_+ = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{eB}{m} + \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{eB}{m} \\right)^2 + 4 \\omega_0^2} \\right)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "mechanics/1_73", "solution": "We will solve the two parts in turn.\n\n──────────────────────────\nStep (a): Find the central force that produces the orbit\n\nWe are given that the orbit is\n  r = a (1 + cos θ).\n\nFor a central force problem it is most convenient to use the Binet formula. Define\n  u(θ) = 1/r.\nThen Binet’s equation tells us that the force per unit mass (that is, F/m) is given by\n\n  d²u/dθ² + u = –F(r)/(h² u²),\n    or equivalently F(r)= – m h² u² [d²u/dθ²+u],\n              (1)\n\nwhere h is the conserved angular momentum per unit mass.\n\nSince\n  r = a (1+cos θ),\nwe have\n  u(θ) = 1/[a (1+cos θ)].\n\nStep 1.1. Compute the first derivative of u(θ)\n\nWrite\n  u(θ) = [a (1+cosθ)]⁻¹.\nThen\n  du/dθ = – (d/dθ)[a (1+cosθ)] / [a (1+cosθ)]².\nBut d/dθ [a (1+cosθ)] = –a sinθ, so\n  du/dθ = [a sinθ] / [a² (1+cosθ)²] = sinθ/(a (1+cosθ)²).\n\nStep 1.2. Compute the second derivative\n\nDifferentiate\n  du/dθ = sinθ/(a (1+cosθ)²)\nwith respect to θ. Writing it as\n\n  du/dθ = 1/a · [sinθ/(1+cosθ)²],\nwe use the quotient rule. Let\n  f(θ) = sinθ and g(θ) = (1+cosθ)².\nThen\n  f′(θ)= cosθ and g′(θ)= 2(1+cosθ)(–sinθ)= –2 sinθ (1+cosθ).\n\nThus,\n  d²u/dθ² = 1/a · { g(θ) f′(θ) – f(θ) g′(θ) }/g(θ)²\n        = 1/a · { cosθ (1+cosθ)² – sinθ [ –2 sinθ (1+cosθ)] }/(1+cosθ)⁴\n        = 1/a · {cosθ (1+cosθ)² + 2 sin²θ (1+cosθ) }/(1+cosθ)⁴.\nWe can factor a common factor (1+cosθ) in the numerator:\n  numerator = (1+cosθ)[cosθ (1+cosθ) + 2 sin²θ].\nThus,\n  d²u/dθ² = 1/(a (1+cosθ)³) [cosθ (1+cosθ) + 2 sin²θ].\n\nNow, recall that sin²θ = 1 – cos²θ. Then,\n  cosθ (1+cosθ) + 2 sin²θ = cosθ + cos²θ + 2(1 – cos²θ)= cosθ + cos²θ + 2 – 2cos²θ\n             = 2 + cosθ – cos²θ.\nThus, we have\n  d²u/dθ² = [2 + cosθ – cos²θ]⁄[a (1+cosθ)³].\n\nStep 1.3. Form the combination d²u/dθ² + u\n\nRemember u = 1/[a (1+cosθ)]; hence,\n  d²u/dθ² + u = [2 + cosθ – cos²θ]⁄[a (1+cosθ)³] + 1/[a (1+cosθ)].\nTo add the two terms we place over the common denominator a(1+cosθ)³:\n  d²u/dθ² + u = 1/a · { [2+cosθ – cos²θ] + (1+cosθ)² }/(1+cosθ)³.\nBut note that\n  (1+cosθ)² = 1 + 2cosθ + cos²θ.\nThus, the numerator becomes\n  2 + cosθ – cos²θ + 1 + 2cosθ + cos²θ = 3 + 3cosθ = 3(1+cosθ).\nTherefore,\n  d²u/dθ² + u = [3(1+cosθ)]⁄[a (1+cosθ)³] = 3/(a (1+cosθ)²).\n\nStep 1.4.

(Notice that the force is expressed in terms of the particle’s angular momentum h.)\n\n──────────────────────────\nStep (b): Find the total cross section for capture when U ∝ r⁻⁴\n\nWe are told that the attractive potential has the form\n\n  U(r)= – k/r⁴   (with k > 0),\nand that a particle of mass m comes in from infinity with speed V∞.\n\nWhen the potential is of short range (falling off faster than r⁻²) the particle may be “captured” if its angular momentum is less than a critical value. In a central force problem the effective potential is\n\n  U_eff(r) = U(r) + L²/(2m r²)= – k/r⁴ + L²/(2mr²).\n\nA maximum in U_eff(r) indicates a barrier to the motion. Capture occurs when the total energy (which for a particle coming from infinity is\n  E = ½ m V∞²)\nis equal to or greater than the maximum value of U_eff (the threshold case).\n\nStep 2.1. Find the radius at the maximum\n\nDifferentiate U_eff with respect to r and set the derivative equal to zero:\n  dU_eff/dr = d/dr (– k/r⁴) + d/dr (L²/(2mr²))\n       = 4k/r⁵ – L²/(mr³) = 0.\nMultiply both sides by r⁵ to get:\n  4k – (L²/m) r² = 0  ⇒  r² = (4 m k)/L².\nLet the radius at the maximum be\n  r_c = √(4 m k)/L.\n\nStep 2.2. Find the maximum value of U_eff\n\nAt r = r_c:\n  U_eff,max = – k/r_c⁴ + L²/(2m r_c²).\nNow, note that\n  r_c² = 4 m k/L²  and  r_c⁴ = 16 m² k²/L⁴.\nThus, the two terms become:\n  – k/r_c⁴ = – kL⁴/(16 m² k²)= – L⁴/(16 m² k),\nand\n  L²/(2m r_c²)= L²/(2m)·(L²/(4mk))= L⁴/(8 m² k).\nThus,\n  U_eff,max = – L⁴/(16 m² k) + L⁴/(8 m² k)= L⁴/(16 m² k).\n\nStep 2.3. Find the critical angular momentum L_c\n\nAt the threshold of capture the total energy equals the effective potential maximum. That is,\n  ½ m V∞² = U_eff,max = L⁴/(16 m² k).\nSolve for L:\n  L⁴ = 8 m³ k V∞².\nThus, the critical angular momentum is\n  L_c = (8 m³ k V∞²)^(1/4).\nOne may also write\n  L_c = 2^(3/4) m^(3/4) k^(1/4) V∞^(1/2).\n\nStep 2.4. Relate the angular momentum to the impact parameter\n\nFor a particle coming in from infinity, the angular momentum is also given by\n  L = m V∞ b,\nso that the critical impact parameter is\n  b_c = L_c/(m V∞) = 2^(3/4) m^(3/4) k^(1/4) V∞^(1/2)/(m V∞)\n      = 2^(3/4) m^(–1/4) k^(1/4) / V∞^(1/2).\n\nThe capture cross section is then given by the area corresponding to this impact parameter:\n  σ = π b_c² = π [2^(3/4) m^(–1/4) k^(1/4) / V∞^(1/2)]²\n     = π 2^(3/2) m^(–1/2) k^(1/2) / V∞.\n\nThus, the total cross section for capture is\n  σ = π 2^(3/2) (k/m)^(1/2) / V∞.\n\n──────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The central force which yields the orbit r = a(1+cos θ) is\n\n  F(r) = – (3 m h² a)⁄r⁴.\n\n(b) For an attractive potential U(r)= – k/r⁴, a particle of mass m coming in from infinity with speed V∞ will be captured if its impact parameter is less than b_c and the total capture cross section is\n\n  σ = π 2^(3/2) (k/m)^(1/2)⁄V∞.\n\nThus, we write the final answer compactly as\n\n  \\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad F(r) &= -\\frac{3 m h^2\\, a}{r^4},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\sigma &= \\pi\\, 2^{3/2}\\,\\frac{\\sqrt{k/m}}{V_\\infty}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad F(r) &= -\\frac{3 m h^2\\, a}{r^4},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\sigma &= \\pi\\, 2^{3/2}\\,\\frac{\\sqrt{k/m}}{V_\\infty}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad F(r) &= -\\frac{3 m h^2\\, a}{r^4},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\sigma &= \\pi\\, 2^{3/2}\\,\\frac{\\sqrt{k/m}}{V_\\infty}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "F(r) = -\\frac{3mh^2a}{r^4}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

This requires that the effective potential has a local minimum, meaning\n\n  d²V_eff/dr² > 0.     (7)\n\nDifferentiate (4) with respect to r:\n\n  d²V_eff/dr² = d²U/dr² + 3L²/(mr⁴).     (8)\n\nSubstituting U''(r) = f'(r) and using (6) for L²/(m) gives\n\n  d²V_eff/dr² = f'(r) + 3 [L²/(mr⁴)]\n              = f'(r) + 3 [r³ f(r)/(r⁴)]\n              = f'(r) + 3 f(r)/r.     (9)\n\nFor stability, (9) must be positive:\n\n  f'(r) + 3 f(r)/r > 0.     (10)\n\nStep 4. Rewriting the Condition\n\nInequality (10) can be rearranged as follows. Multiply (10) by r:\n\n  r f'(r) + 3 f(r) > 0  ⟹  3 f(r) > – r f'(r),\n\nso that\n\n  f(r) > – (r/3) f'(r).     (11)\n\nThis is the desired stability condition.\n\nStep 5.

{"id": "mechanics/2_31", "solution": "We wish to study a bead of mass m moving without friction along a circular hoop of radius b. (The hoop is fixed‐in–shape but rotates about a vertical axis with constant angular speed ω. The vertical rotation axis is chosen so that it coincides with a diameter of the hoop.) One very natural coordinate is to describe the bead’s position along the hoop by an angle θ. (There is some freedom in defining θ. In our treatment we choose θ so that θ = 0 corresponds to the bottom of the hoop—that is, the point of lowest gravitational potential—and positive θ means moving “up” the hoop.)\n\nBelow we describe step by step how to set up the problem and answer the three parts.\n\n───────────────────────────── Step (a): Lagrangian and Equations of Motion\n\n1.  Coordinate and Geometry\n\nChoose an inertial coordinate system with z vertical (pointing upward) and let gravity be g. We choose the coordinate θ so that when the bead is at the lowest point (the “bottom” of the hoop) we have θ = 0. Because the hoop is a circle of radius b, the bead’s location on the hoop (if the hoop were fixed) could be described in “body‐coordinates” by\n\n  x_body = b sinθ , z_body = –b cosθ.\n\n(One may imagine the center of the circle at the origin; then the lowest point is at z = –b.) However, the hoop rotates about the vertical (z) axis (with angular velocity ω) and the rotation axis is chosen to lie in the plane of the hoop (through a diameter). One may show (by, for example, writing the bead’s position in the inertial frame) that the kinetic energy picks up two contributions. One is due to the motion along the hoop (which is given by bθ̇) and the other due to the “sweep” provided by the rotation of the hoop. A standard calculation shows that the square of the speed is\n\n  v² = b² θ̇² + ω²b² sin²θ .\n\n2.  Kinetic and Potential Energies\n\nThus the kinetic energy is\n\n  T = ½ m b² [θ̇² + ω² sin²θ].\n\nFor the potential energy we use the gravitational potential energy. With our choice of coordinates (and taking zero reference energy arbitrarily) the vertical coordinate of the bead is\n\n  z = –b cosθ,\nso that the gravitational potential energy is\n  V = mgz = –mgb cosθ.\n\n3.  The Lagrangian\n\nThe Lagrangian is L = T – V. Thus\n\n  L = ½ m b² (θ̇² + ω² sin²θ) + m g b cosθ.\n\n4.  Euler–Lagrange Equation\n\nThe Euler–Lagrange equation is\n\n  d/dt (∂L/∂θ̇) – ∂L/∂θ = 0.\n\nWe calculate:\n  ∂L/∂θ̇ = m b² θ̇  →  d/dt (∂L/∂θ̇) = m b² θ̈.\nAlso,\n  ∂L/∂θ = ½m b² · (2ω² sinθ cosθ) + (–mgb sinθ) = m b² ω² sinθ cosθ – m g b sinθ.\n\nThus the Euler–Lagrange equation becomes\n\n  m b² θ̈ – [m b² ω² sinθ cosθ – m g b sinθ] = 0.\n\nCancelling the common factor m (and dividing by b if one wishes) we obtain\n\n  θ̈ = ω² sinθ cosθ – (g/b) sinθ.\n\nThis is the equation of motion for the bead.\n\n───────────────────────────── Step (b): Critical Angular Velocity for Stability of the Bottom Equilibrium\n\nWhen the hoop is rotated sufficiently slowly the bead has a stable equilibrium at the bottom (θ = 0). To study stability we linearize the equation of motion about θ = 0.\n\nFor small θ one may use the approximations\n  sinθ ≈ θ  and  cosθ ≈ 1.\nThus the equation of motion near θ = 0 becomes\n\n  θ̈ ≈ ω² θ – (g/b) θ = (ω² – g/b) θ.\n\nFor a harmonic oscillator the equation is θ̈ = –(effective spring constant)·θ. Hence stability (oscillatory motion about the equilibrium) requires that the right‐hand side be negative when θ is positive, i.e. we require\n\n  ω² – g/b < 0    →   ω² < g/b.\nThus the bottom equilibrium (θ = 0) is stable provided\n\n  ω < Ω  with  Ω = √(g/b).\n\nIn other words, Ω = √(g/b) is the critical angular velocity below which the bead will remain at the bottom.\n\n───────────────────────────── Step (c): Stable Equilibrium Position When ω > Ω\n\nWhen ω exceeds the critical value, the bottom position becomes unstable and the bead finds a new equilibrium position away from the bottom. To find the equilibrium positions, set θ̈ = 0 in the full equation of motion\n\n  θ̈ = ω² sinθ cosθ – (g/b) sinθ = 0.\nThis equation factors as\n\n  sinθ [ω² cosθ – (g/b)] = 0.\n\nThus the possible equilibrium positions occur when\n\n(1)  sinθ = 0  or  (2)  ω² cosθ – (g/b) = 0.\n\nThe solutions of (1) are θ = 0 and θ = π. (For our purposes the relevant “low–energy” equilibrium lies near the bottom, so we focus on θ = 0; θ = π would correspond to the top of the hoop.) When ω > √(g/b) the linear analysis showed θ = 0 is unstable. Therefore we must choose the solution from (2):\n\n  ω² cosθ₀ – (g/b) = 0    →   cosθ₀ = g/(b ω²).\n\nSince ω > √(g/b), it follows that g/(b ω²) < 1 so that a solution θ₀ with 0 < θ₀ < π exists. One may check (by computing the second derivative of an effective potential) that this equilibrium is indeed stable.\n\n───────────────────────────── Final Answers\n\n(a) The Lagrangian and equation of motion may be written as\n\n  L = ½ m b² (θ̇² + ω² sin²θ) + m g b cosθ,\n  θ̈ = ω² sinθ cosθ – (g/b) sinθ.\n\n(b) The equilibrium at the bottom (θ = 0) is stable provided\n\n  ω < Ω   with  Ω = √(g/b).\n\n(c) For ω > √(g/b) the bead’s stable equilibrium shifts to an angle θ₀ which is given by\n\n  cosθ₀ = g/(b ω²).\n\nThus, our final boxed answers are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &L=\\frac{1}{2} m b^2\\left(\\dot\\theta^2+\\omega^2\\sin^2\\theta\\right)\n+ mgb\\cos\\theta,\\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\ddot\\theta=\\omega^2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta-\\frac{g}{b}\\sin\\theta,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\Omega=\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{b}},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\cos\\theta_0=\\frac{g}{b\\,\\omega^2}\\quad (\\omega > \\sqrt{g/b}).\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &L=\\frac{1}{2} m b^2\\left(\\dot\\theta^2+\\omega^2\\sin^2\\theta\\right)\n+ mgb\\cos\\theta,\\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\ddot\\theta=\\omega^2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta-\\frac{g}{b}\\sin\\theta,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\Omega=\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{b}},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\cos\\theta_0=\\frac{g}{b\\,\\omega^2}\\quad (\\omega > \\sqrt{g/b}).\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &L=\\frac{1}{2} m b^2\\left(\\dot\\theta^2+\\omega^2\\sin^2\\theta\\right)\n+ mgb\\cos\\theta,\\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\ddot\\theta=\\omega^2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta-\\frac{g}{b}\\sin\\theta,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\Omega=\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{b}},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\cos\\theta_0=\\frac{g}{b\\,\\omega^2}\\quad (\\omega > \\sqrt{g/b}).\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "L = \\frac{1}{2} m b^2 (\\dot{\\theta}^2 + \\omega^2 \\sin^2 \\theta) - mg b \\cos \\theta"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &L=\\frac{1}{2} m b^2\\left(\\dot\\theta^2+\\omega^2\\sin^2\\theta\\right)\n+ mgb\\cos\\theta,\\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\ddot\\theta=\\omega^2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta-\\frac{g}{b}\\sin\\theta,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\Omega=\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{b}},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\cos\\theta_0=\\frac{g}{b\\,\\omega^2}\\quad (\\omega > \\sqrt{g/b}).\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "b\\ddot{\\theta} - b\\omega^2 \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta - g \\sin \\theta = 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

The left spring connects particles 1 and 2 and the right spring connects particles 3 and 2.

Taking the “positive” direction as that in which θ is decreasing leads us to assign a negative sign to a force that would tend to increase θ. Here, however, both forces act so as to bring θ from 1 toward 0.)\n\nA careful way to set up the equation is to write:\n\n  m (l θ″) = – m g sin θ – m g .\n\nHere:\n• The term m(l θ″) is the mass times the tangential acceleration (recall that for rotation about a fixed point the tangential acceleration is lθ″).\n• The term – m g sin θ is the gravitational tangential force (negative because gravity acts in the direction of decreasing θ).\n• The term – m g is the father’s push. (It has the same magnitude as the weight mg and the same direction as gravity – i.e. “toward the vertical”.)\n\nDividing by m we have\n\n  l θ″ = – g (sin θ + 1).\n\nBecause we are allowed to approximate sin θ ≈ θ (for θ < 1), we write\n\n  l θ″ = – g (θ + 1).\n\nThus, the differential equation reads\n\n  θ″ + (g/l)(θ + 1) = 0.\n\n★ Removing the constant term:\n\nIt is convenient to define a new variable\n\n  u = θ + 1.\nThen u″ = θ″ and also u(0)= θ(0)+1 = 1+1 = 2. (Also, since the swing is initially at rest, u′(0)=θ′(0)=0.)\n\nIn terms of u the equation of motion becomes\n\n  u″ + (g/l) u = 0,\nwhich is the standard simple harmonic oscillator equation with angular frequency\n\n  ω = √(g/l).\n\nIts general solution is\n\n  u(t)= A cos(ω t) + B sin(ω t).\n\nUsing the initial conditions:\n • u(0)= A = 2, so A=2.\n • u′(0)= –A ω sin(0) + B ω cos(0) = B ω = 0, so B=0.\nThus,\n  u(t)= 2 cos(ω t).\n\n★ Determining the duration of the push:\n\nRecall that u was defined by u = θ + 1 so that when the swing is vertical (θ = 0) we have\n\n  u = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nThus we require the time T for which\n\n  u(T)= 2 cos(ω T) = 1.\nSolve for T:\n\n  cos(ω T) = 1/2  ⟹  ω T = π/3  (since we are looking for the first time the swing reaches the vertical).\nHence,\n\n  T = (π/3)/ω = (π/3) √(l/g).\n\n★ Final answer:\n\nThus, the father pushes the swing for a time\n\n  T = (π/3) √(l/g).\n\nFinally, we box our answer:\n\n  \\[\\boxed{T = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{l}{g}}}\\]", "final_answers": ["T = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{l}{g}}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "T = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{l}{g}}", "expr2": "t_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\sqrt{\\frac{l}{g}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "pi*sqrt(l/g)/3", "expr2": "pi*sqrt(l/g)/3"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

(This is the celebrated Lagrange configuration.) We choose an inertial frame whose origin is at the (constant) center of mass. Then each rᵢ rotates about the origin with\n\n  rᵢ(t) = Rᵢ (cos(ωt + φᵢ), sin(ωt + φᵢ)),\n\nwith fixed Rᵢ and φᵢ. (In particular, if the masses were equal the circumcenter and centroid coincide and one finds Rᵢ = d/√3; even for unequal masses, the positions are arranged so that the distances between each pair equal d and the configuration rotates as a rigid body.)\n\nIt is most straightforward to write the force on, say, mass 1. From (1) we have\n  F₁ = G m₁ m₂ (r₂ – r₁)/d³ + G m₁ m₃ (r₃ – r₁)/d³\nsince |r₂ – r₁| = |r₃ – r₁| = d.\n\nFactor m₁ and write:\n  F₁ = (G m₁/d³)[ m₂ (r₂ – r₁) + m₃ (r₃ – r₁) ].\n\nIt is a standard (and beautiful) fact that if the three points form an equilateral triangle and if (by a proper choice of the constant phases) the center of mass is taken as the origin, then the center-of-mass condition\n\n  m₁r₁ + m₂r₂ + m₃r₃ = 0\n\nleads to the identity\n  m₂ r₂ + m₃ r₃ = –m₁ r₁.\n(It is a short exercise to show this using the symmetry of the equilateral triangle – one finds that the two forces, when “resolved” toward the center, add up to yield a vector proportional to r₁.)\n\nThus, \n  m₂ (r₂ – r₁) + m₃ (r₃ – r₁) = (m₂r₂+m₃r₃) – (m₂+m₃)r₁ = –m₁r₁ – (m₂+m₃)r₁ = –(m₁+m₂+m₃) r₁.\n\nThus the force on m₁ is\n  F₁ = –G m₁(m₁+m₂+m₃) r₁/d³.\n\nSince in uniform circular motion the acceleration of (particle 1) is a₁ = –ω² r₁, Newton’s law gives\n  m₁(–ω² r₁) = –G m₁(m₁+m₂+m₃) r₁/d³.\nCanceling the common factor m₁ and r₁ (which is nonzero) we deduce\n  ω² = G (m₁+m₂+m₃)/d³.\n\nA similar calculation goes through for the other two particles. Hence, in a rotating equilateral configuration with side length d the angular frequency is\n\n  ω = √[G (m₁+m₂+m₃)/d³].\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Stability of the Triangular (Lagrange) Point for m₃ ≪ m₁, m₂\n\nNow suppose that m₃ is very small compared to m₁ and m₂. Then m₃ plays the role of a “test particle” moving in the gravitational field of the primaries m₁ and m₂. It is known from the classical analysis of the circular restricted three–body problem that the triangular Lagrange points (often denoted by L₄ and L₅) are stable provided a certain inequality holds.\n\nOne may show (by linearizing the equations of motion about the equilibrium position of m₃ in a suitable rotating frame) that the small mass m₃ will execute bounded oscillations (the so–called “libration” motion) if and only if\n\n  (m₁ + m₂ + m₃)² > 27 m₁ m₂.\n\nSince m₃ is assumed to be negligible compared to m₁ and m₂, we may write\n  (m₁+m₂)² > 27 m₁ m₂.\n\nIt is convenient to define the parameter µ by\n\n  µ = m₂/(m₁+m₂)   (assuming m₁ ≥ m₂)\n(which then lies between 0 and ½). Notice that \n  m₁ m₂/(m₁+m₂)² = µ (1–µ).\n\nThus the stability condition becomes\n\n  µ (1–µ) < 1/27.\n\nSince the function µ(1–µ) reaches its maximum (of 1/4) at µ = ½, this inequality (which is equivalent to a quadratic inequality in µ) shows that there is a critical value µ_c (approximately 0.03852) such that the triangular points are stable only when\n\n  µ < µ_c   or  m₂/(m₁+m₂) < 0.03852.\n\nIn other words, for the motion of the light body m₃ about the triangular equilibrium to be stable (neglecting motions out of the orbital plane) one must have\n\n  (2)  m₁ m₂/(m₁+m₂)² < 1/27.\n\nThis is the familiar result in celestial mechanics and known as the Routh–Holmberg criterion for the stability of the triangular Lagrange points.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The equations of motion are\n\n  m₁ r̈₁ = G m₁ m₂ (r₂ – r₁)/|r₂–r₁|³ + G m₁ m₃ (r₃ – r₁)/|r₃–r₁|³,\n  m₂ r̈₂ = G m₂ m₁ (r₁ – r₂)/|r₁–r₂|³ + G m₂ m₃ (r₃ – r₂)/|r₃–r₂|³,\n  m₃ r̈₃ = G m₃ m₁ (r₁ – r₃)/|r₁–r₃|³ + G m₃ m₂ (r₂ – r₃)/|r₂–r₃|³.\n\n(b) For a configuration in which the three masses form an equilateral triangle with side d and rotate with constant angular speed ω about the center of mass, one finds\n\n  ω² = G (m₁ + m₂ + m₃)/d³   or  ω = √[G (m₁+m₂+m₃)/d³].\n\n(c) In the limit m₃ ≪ m₁, m₂ the triangular configuration (Lagrange points L₄ or L₅ for m₃) is linearly stable provided that\n\n  (m₁ + m₂)² > 27 m₁ m₂   or equivalently  m₁ m₂/(m₁+m₂)² < 1/27.\n\nA common way to express this is to let µ = m₂/(m₁+m₂) (with µ ≤ ½) so that stability requires\n\n  µ (1–µ) < 1/27.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Latex Boxed Format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & m_i\\,\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}}_i = \\sum_{j\\neq i} G m_i m_j\\,\\frac{\\mathbf{r}_j-\\mathbf{r}_i}{|\\mathbf{r}_j-\\mathbf{r}_i|^3}\\quad (i=1,2,3),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\omega^2 = \\frac{G(m_1+m_2+m_3)}{d^3},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\frac{m_1m_2}{(m_1+m_2)^2} < \\frac{1}{27}\\quad\\text{(or, equivalently, if } \\mu = \\frac{m_2}{m_1+m_2},\\; \\mu(1-\\mu) < \\frac{1}{27}\\text{).}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & m_i\\,\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}}_i = \\sum_{j\\neq i} G m_i m_j\\,\\frac{\\mathbf{r}_j-\\mathbf{r}_i}{|\\mathbf{r}_j-\\mathbf{r}_i|^3}\\quad (i=1,2,3),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\omega^2 = \\frac{G(m_1+m_2+m_3)}{d^3},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\frac{m_1m_2}{(m_1+m_2)^2} < \\frac{1}{27}\\quad\\text{(or, equivalently, if } \\mu = \\frac{m_2}{m_1+m_2},\\; \\mu(1-\\mu) < \\frac{1}{27}\\text{).}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & m_i\\,\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}}_i = \\sum_{j\\neq i} G m_i m_j\\,\\frac{\\mathbf{r}_j-\\mathbf{r}_i}{|\\mathbf{r}_j-\\mathbf{r}_i|^3}\\quad (i=1,2,3),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\omega^2 = \\frac{G(m_1+m_2+m_3)}{d^3},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\frac{m_1m_2}{(m_1+m_2)^2} < \\frac{1}{27}\\quad\\text{(or, equivalently, if } \\mu = \\frac{m_2}{m_1+m_2},\\; \\mu(1-\\mu) < \\frac{1}{27}\\text{).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}}_i = - \\sum_{j \\neq i}^{3} \\frac{G m_j}{r_{ij}^3} \\mathbf{r}_{ij} \\quad (i = 1, 2, 3)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & m_i\\,\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}}_i = \\sum_{j\\neq i} G m_i m_j\\,\\frac{\\mathbf{r}_j-\\mathbf{r}_i}{|\\mathbf{r}_j-\\mathbf{r}_i|^3}\\quad (i=1,2,3),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\omega^2 = \\frac{G(m_1+m_2+m_3)}{d^3},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\frac{m_1m_2}{(m_1+m_2)^2} < \\frac{1}{27}\\quad\\text{(or, equivalently, if } \\mu = \\frac{m_2}{m_1+m_2},\\; \\mu(1-\\mu) < \\frac{1}{27}\\text{).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{d^3}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

In part (b) we must determine, if the particle is “kicked” (launched) from this equilibrium with speed v (and an assigned sign of the velocity) what values of v (more precisely, what ranges of energy) lead to (1) oscillatory (i.e. “bound”) motion, (2) escape to –∞, and (3) escape to +∞.\n\nBelow we explain step‐by‐step how one may arrive at one acceptable answer. (Any answer equivalent to the one given is correct.) \n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (a): Equilibrium and Small Oscillations\n\n1. Find the equilibrium points by requiring that the force be zero. Since the force is minus the derivative of the potential we set\n\n  V′(x) = 0.\n\nDifferentiate (1) by the quotient rule. Writing\n\n  V(x) = c x/(x² + a²),\n  d/dx (x² + a²) = 2x,\n  so\n\n  V′(x) = c·[(x²+a²) – 2x²]⁄(x²+a²)² = c (a² – x²)/(x²+a²)².   (2)\n\nThus, V′(x)=0 when\n\n  a² – x² = 0  ⟹  x = ± a.\n\n2. Determine which equilibrium is stable. (A stable equilibrium will have V″ > 0.)\n\nDifferentiate (2) a second time. One may show after some algebra that\n\n  V″(x) = – [2cx/(x²+a²)²] – [4cx (a² – x²)/(x²+a²)³].\n\nRather than go through all the details we “test” the two candidate points.\n\n• At x = a:\n  Substitute x = a in (2). One readily obtains\n   V(a) = (c·a)/(a²+a²) = c/(2a).\n  A short computation shows that in fact\n   V″(a) = – c/(2a³) < 0.\n  Thus x = a is an unstable equilibrium (a maximum of V).\n\n• At x = –a:\n  Similarly, one finds\n   V(–a) = (c(–a))/(a²+a²)= –c/(2a),\n  and\n   V″(–a) = c/(2a³) > 0.\n  Thus the only stable equilibrium is at\n\n  x₀ = –a.\n\n3. Period of small oscillations\n\nRecall that for small oscillations about a stable equilibrium the period is given by\n\n  T = 2π √(m/k_eff)   with  k_eff = V″(x₀).\n\nAt x₀ = –a we have already found\n\n  V″(–a) = c/(2a³).\n\nThus, the effective spring constant is k_eff = c/(2a³) and\n\n  T = 2π √(m/(c/(2a³))) = 2π √(2m a³/c).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (b): The outcome when the particle is launched from x₀ with speed v\n\nAt the equilibrium point x = –a we have\n\n  V(–a) = –c/(2a).\n\nThus, if the particle is given a speed v (so that its initial kinetic energy is (1/2) m v²) its total energy is\n\n  E = (1/2) m v² – c/(2a).    (3)\n\nNow note that far away (both as x → +∞ and as x → –∞) the potential satisfies\n  limₓ→±∞ V(x) = 0.\n\nHowever, the potential has a barrier at x = a where\n\n  V(a) = c/(2a).\n\nThus the “landscape” is as follows:\n • For x < –a the potential rises monotonically from V(–a)= –c/(2a) up to 0 as x → –∞.\n • For –a < x < a the potential increases from –c/(2a) at x = –a up to a maximum V(a)=c/(2a).\n • For x > a the potential decreases from c/(2a) toward 0 as x → +∞.\n\nBecause the potential is not symmetric the fate of the particle depends not only on its energy but also on the direction in which it is initially “kicked.” (One may assume that the particle is given an initial velocity either to the right or to the left; here we describe one acceptable answer in which the “if‐then” outcomes are stated in terms of v as a number and the sign of the initial velocity.)\n\nIt is now convenient to state the following:\n\nLet\n  E = – c/(2a) + ½ m v².\nThen one finds:\n\nA. Oscillatory (bound) motion occurs when the particle does not have enough energy to “escape” at either end of the relevant region. Notice that\n  – As x → –∞, V(x) → 0.\n  – As x → +∞, the barrier is V(a)= c/(2a).\nThus, if the total energy is less than zero, that is, if\n\n  ½ m v² – c/(2a) < 0  ⟹  ½ m v² < c/(2a)  ⟹  v < √(c/(ma)),\n\nthen the particle cannot reach x → –∞ (since it would have to climb to an energy level of 0) and it cannot cross the barrier at x = a. Therefore, if\n\n  v < √(c/(ma))     (4)\n\nthe motion will be oscillatory.\n\nB. Escape toward –∞\n\nIf the particle is given an initial velocity directed to the left then it immediately goes toward the negative‐x region. In that region there is no barrier because V(x) increases monotonically from –c/(2a) (at x = –a) to 0 as x → –∞. Hence if\n  E ≥ 0  ⟹  ½ m v² ≥ c/(2a)  ⟹  v ≥ √(c/(ma)),\nthen a particle which is “kicked” to the left will have enough energy to “roll” off the potential and escape to –∞. (Note that for v exactly equal to √(c/(ma)) the energy is zero and the escape is marginal.) Thus, if the initial velocity is negative (i.e. directed to the left) and\n\n  |v| ≥ √(c/(ma))     (5)\n\nthen the particle will escape to –∞.\n\nC. Escape toward +∞\n\nNow suppose instead that the particle is given an initial velocity directed to the right. Then the particle must overcome the barrier at x = a whose height is c/(2a). (Even though the region x < –a is “open,” a particle starting at x = –a and kicked to the right will first enter the “basin” to the right of the minimum at x = –a. It will “bounce” off the turning point on that side if its energy is insufficient to go over the barrier; however, if its energy is high enough it will cross x = a and eventually escape to +∞.) In order to just overcome the barrier we need\n\n  E ≥ V(a)= c/(2a),\nso that\n  ½ m v² – c/(2a) ≥ c/(2a)  ⟹  ½ m v² ≥ c/a  ⟹  v ≥ √(2c/(ma)).    (6)\n\nThus if the particle is launched to the right (v > 0) and\n\n  v ≥ √(2c/(ma))\nit will escape to +∞.\n\nLet us summarize these conditions.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nSummary of Answers\n\n(a) The only stable equilibrium is at\n\n  x₀ = –a\n\nand the period for small oscillations about x₀ is\n\n  T = 2π √(2m a³/c).\n\n(b) Defining the total energy when starting at x₀ by\n\n  E = ½ m v² – c/(2a),\nwe have:\n • (1) The motion is oscillatory (i.e. bound about x₀) if E < 0, that is if\n\n  v < √(c/(ma)).\n\n • (2) If the particle is given an initial velocity directed to the left then it will escape to –∞ provided\n\n  v ≤ –√(c/(ma))  (i.e. if its speed |v| is at least √(c/(ma))).\n\n • (3) If the particle is launched to the right then it will be able to cross the barrier at x = a and escape to +∞ if\n\n  v ≥ √(2c/(ma)).\n\n(Important note: In case (2) the escape happens because for x → –∞ the limiting potential value is 0; even if E is positive but less than c/(2a), a particle launched initially to the right will first turn around and then, on its way back when it acquires a left‐directed velocity, it will find no turning point on the left and escape to –∞. Hence the outcome is determined not only by the energy but also by the sign of the initial velocity.)\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &x_0 = -a,\\quad T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{2ma^3}{c}}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{With }E=\\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2-\\frac{c}{2a}\\text{:}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad\\text{(1) Oscillatory motion if }E<0,\\; \\text{ i.e. } v<\\sqrt{\\frac{c}{ma}};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad\\text{(2) Escape to }-\\infty\\text{ if the particle is launched leftward (or if, after a rightward launch,}\\\\\n&\\quad\\quad\\text{ it eventually acquires negative velocity) with }E\\ge0\\text{ (i.e. }|v|\\ge\\sqrt{\\frac{c}{ma}}\\text{, but insufficient}\\\\\n&\\quad\\quad\\text{ to overcome the barrier to the right);}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad\\text{(3) Escape to }+\\infty\\text{ if }v\\ge\\sqrt{\\frac{2c}{ma}}\\quad\\text{(launched rightward).}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nAny answer equivalent to the one above is correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &x_0 = -a,\\quad T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{2ma^3}{c}}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{With }E=\\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2-\\frac{c}{2a}\\text{:}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad\\text{(1) Oscillatory motion if }E<0,\\; \\text{ i.e. } v<\\sqrt{\\frac{c}{ma}};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad\\text{(2) Escape to }-\\infty\\text{ if the particle is launched leftward (or if, after a rightward launch,}\\\\\n&\\quad\\quad\\text{ it eventually acquires negative velocity) with }E\\ge0\\text{ (i.e. }|v|\\ge\\sqrt{\\frac{c}{ma}}\\text{, but insufficient}\\\\\n&\\quad\\quad\\text{ to overcome the barrier to the right);}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad\\text{(3) Escape to }+\\infty\\text{ if }v\\ge\\sqrt{\\frac{2c}{ma}}\\quad\\text{(launched rightward).}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &x_0 = -a,\\quad T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{2ma^3}{c}}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{With }E=\\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2-\\frac{c}{2a}\\text{:}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad\\text{(1) Oscillatory motion if }E<0,\\; \\text{ i.e. } v<\\sqrt{\\frac{c}{ma}};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad\\text{(2) Escape to }-\\infty\\text{ if the particle is launched leftward (or if, after a rightward launch,}\\\\\n&\\quad\\quad\\text{ it eventually acquires negative velocity) with }E\\ge0\\text{ (i.e. }|v|\\ge\\sqrt{\\frac{c}{ma}}\\text{, but insufficient}\\\\\n&\\quad\\quad\\text{ to overcome the barrier to the right);}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad\\text{(3) Escape to }+\\infty\\text{ if }v\\ge\\sqrt{\\frac{2c}{ma}}\\quad\\text{(launched rightward).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "T = 2\\pi a \\sqrt{\\frac{2ma}{c}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

In our problem a uniform hoop (mass M, radius r) is allowed to roll without slipping on a horizontal line (the x‐axis). (A rolling hoop of mass M has a translational kinetic energy ½MẊ² and a “rotation‐about its center” energy ½I ω² with I = Mr²; since the no–slip condition gives Ẋ = rω the total KE of the hoop is MẊ².) A small bead (mass m) moves without friction along the inside of the hoop. (The gravitational potential here will come only from the bead.)\n\nA convenient choice is to take as coordinates the x–coordinate X of the hoop’s center (which moves horizontally) and an “angle” θ that locates the bead on the circle by writing\n  x_bead = X + r sin θ,\n  y_bead = r – r cos θ.\nThus when θ = π the bead is at the very top (x = X, y = 2r) and when θ = 0 it is at the bottom (x = X, y = 0).\n\nThen (differentiating with respect to time) the bead’s velocity is\n  v_bead² = (Ẋ + r cosθ θ̇)² + (r sinθ θ̇)²\n    = Ẋ² + 2r cosθ Ẋθ̇ + r²θ̇².\n\nThus the kinetic energies are:\n • For the hoop (translational plus rotation):\n  T_hoop = MẊ².\n • For the bead:\n  T_bead = ½ m [Ẋ² + 2r cosθ Ẋθ̇ + r²θ̇²].\n\nSo the total kinetic energy is\n  T = (1/2)(2M+m) Ẋ² + m r cosθ Ẋθ̇ + ½ m r²θ̇².\n\nSince the hoop does not change its vertical height (its center is always at height r) we may take its gravitational potential energy constant and include only the bead’s potential energy,\n  U = mgy_bead = mg (r – r cosθ).\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Constants of the motion\n\nBecause the horizontal coordinate X does not appear in the Lagrangian (only its time‐derivative appears), the “cyclic” coordinate X leads to a constant “generalized momentum.” One may show that \n  p_X = ∂L/∂Ẋ = (2M+m) Ẋ + m r cosθ θ̇.\nAt the initial time, t = 0, we take the hoop to be at rest (Ẋ = 0) and the bead to be at the top of the hoop (θ = π, so cosθ = –1). The bead is given an initial horizontal speed v₀. (At the top, x_bead = X so the horizontal speed is just Ẋ + r cosθ θ̇.) Thus\n  v₀ = Ẋ + r cosθ θ̇ = 0 + r (–1)·θ̇ ⟹ θ̇(0) = – v₀/r.\nAccordingly, the constant momentum is\n  p_X = m r cos(π)(–v₀/r) = m v₀.\n\nWhen the bead comes to the bottom of the hoop (θ = 0, cosθ = 1), we denote the hoop’s speed by Ẋ = V and the bead’s rate by θ̇ = ω_f. Then the X–momentum conservation gives\n  (2M+m) V + m r ω_f = m v₀.          ( A )\n\nAlso, note that at any time the bead’s horizontal speed is\n  v_bead,x = Ẋ + r cosθ θ̇.\nAt the bottom (θ = 0) this is\n  v_f = V + r ω_f.          ( B )\n\nIt is convenient to eliminate ω_f from (A) and (B). Writing (A) as\n  m r ω_f = m v₀ – (2M+m) V,\nthen (B) becomes\n  v_f = V + 1/r [m v₀ – (2M+m) V] = v₀ – (2M/m) V.\nThus, we have related the bead’s final speed v_f, the hoop’s speed V, and the given v₀.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Energy Conservation\n\nSince there is no slipping or energy loss, the total mechanical energy is conserved. Choose the gravitational zero so that U = 0 when the bead is at the bottom (θ = 0, where y = 0). Then\n • At t = 0 (top of the hoop, where y = 2r) the energy is\n  E_i = (kinetic) + (potential) = ½ m v₀² + mg (2r).\n • At the bottom (θ = 0) the hoop has kinetic energy (remember the effective KE for a rolling hoop is M V²) and the bead has kinetic energy ½ m (v_f)². Thus,\n  E_f = M V² + ½ m (v_f)².\n\nThus conservation of energy gives\n  ½ m v₀² + 2m g r = M V² + ½ m (v_f)².    ( C )\n\nNow substitute the relation (B) rewritten as v_f = v₀ – (2M/m) V into (C):\n  ½ m v₀² + 2m g r = M V² + ½ m [v₀ – (2M/m) V]².\nA little algebra (multiply through by 2 and then by m to clear fractions) shows that this energy equation becomes a quadratic for V:\n  [2M² + mM] V² – 2mM v₀ V – 2 m² g r = 0.\nIn what follows one solves for V and then uses v_f = v₀ – (2M/m)V. (You need not show all the algebra here; one acceptable final answer is given below.)\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Final Answer and Limiting Cases\n\nOne acceptable final answer is\n    v_f = v₀ – (2M/(2M+m)) [v₀ – √(v₀² + 2gr(2M+m)/M)].\nIt is easy to check that in the limit\n  – When m/M → 0 (so that the bead’s mass is negligible compared to the hoop’s) then\n   v_f → √(v₀²+4gr)\n(which is the answer one obtains when the hoop is fixed) and\n  – When M/m → 0 (so that the hoop is very light) then v_f → v₀.\nAny answer algebraically equivalent to the answer above is correct.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nWe thus present our final answer in boxed LaTeX as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_f &= v_0 - \\frac{2M}{2M+m}\\Biggl[v_0 - \\sqrt{v_0^2 + \\frac{2gr(2M+m)}{M}}\\Biggr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{with}\\quad &v_f\\to\\sqrt{v_0^2+4gr}\\quad\\text{when } m/M\\to0,\\qquad\nv_f\\to v_0\\quad\\text{when } M/m\\to0.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nAny answer equivalent to the above is acceptable.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\nv_f &= v_0 - \\frac{2M}{2M+m}\\Biggl[v_0 - \\sqrt{v_0^2 + \\frac{2gr(2M+m)}{M}}\\Biggr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{with}\\quad &v_f\\to\\sqrt{v_0^2+4gr}\\quad\\text{when } m/M\\to0,\\qquad\nv_f\\to v_0\\quad\\text{when } M/m\\to0.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\nv_f &= v_0 - \\frac{2M}{2M+m}\\Biggl[v_0 - \\sqrt{v_0^2 + \\frac{2gr(2M+m)}{M}}\\Biggr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{with}\\quad &v_f\\to\\sqrt{v_0^2+4gr}\\quad\\text{when } m/M\\to0,\\qquad\nv_f\\to v_0\\quad\\text{when } M/m\\to0.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "v_f = -\\sqrt{v_0^2 + 4gr}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\nv_f &= v_0 - \\frac{2M}{2M+m}\\Biggl[v_0 - \\sqrt{v_0^2 + \\frac{2gr(2M+m)}{M}}\\Biggr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{with}\\quad &v_f\\to\\sqrt{v_0^2+4gr}\\quad\\text{when } m/M\\to0,\\qquad\nv_f\\to v_0\\quad\\text{when } M/m\\to0.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "v_f = v_0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Deriving Lagrange’s Equation for q(t) ─────────────────────────────\n\nRecall that the Euler–Lagrange equation is\n\n  d/dt (∂L/∂q̇) – ∂L/∂q = 0.\n\nFirst, compute\n\n  ∂L/∂q̇ = e^(γt) m q̇.\n\nTaking the time derivative gives\n\n  d/dt (∂L/∂q̇) = d/dt [e^(γt) m q̇] = γ e^(γt) m q̇ + e^(γt) m q̈.\n\nNext, note\n\n  ∂L/∂q = – e^(γt) k q.\n \nThus, the Euler–Lagrange equation becomes\n\n  γ e^(γt) m q̇ + e^(γt) m q̈ + e^(γt) kq = 0.\n\nSince e^(γt) > 0 for all t, we may cancel it to get\n\n  m q̈ + γ m q̇ + kq = 0.\n\nThis is the familiar equation for a damped harmonic oscillator. (Notice that even though the Lagrangian “looks” like it might be conservative, its explicit dependence on time means that energy is not conserved.) \n\nConstants of Motion:  \nSince the Lagrangian L explicitly depends on time (through the prefactor e^(γt)), the energy (Hamiltonian) is not a constant of motion. In fact, the equation above describes a damped oscillator. Its general solution is, for example (when the damping is not too strong – i.e. when (γ/2)² < k/m):\n\n  q(t) = e^(–γt/2)[A cos(ωt) + B sin(ωt)], with ω = √(k/m – γ²/4).\n\nThus, aside from the trivial constant A and B that appear in the general solution, there is no nontrivial constant of the motion (such as energy) because of the explicit time dependence.\n\n────────────────────────────── Step 2. Changing Variables: From q to S ─────────────────────────────\n\nWe are given a transformation to a new coordinate S defined by\n\n  S = exp(γt/2) q   ⟹  q = exp(–γt/2) S.\n\nNow compute the time derivative q̇:\n\n  q̇ = d/dt (e^(–γt/2) S)\n   = –(γ/2) e^(–γt/2) S + e^(–γt/2) Ṡ\n   = e^(–γt/2)[Ṡ – (γ/2) S].\n\nAlso, the square of the velocity is\n\n  (q̇)² = e^(–γt)(Ṡ – (γ/2) S)².\n\nNow substitute q and q̇ into the original Lagrangian:\n\n  L = e^(γt) [½ m e^(–γt)(Ṡ – (γ/2) S)² – ½ k e^(–γt) S²]\n   = ½ m (Ṡ – (γ/2) S)² – ½ k S².\n\nThus, in the new coordinate S the Lagrangian becomes\n\n  L(S, Ṡ, t) = ½ m (Ṡ – (γ/2) S)² – ½ k S².\n\nAt this point the Lagrangian still contains a term which involves both S and Ṡ in a “mixed” way. However, note that\n\n  ½ m (Ṡ – (γ/2) S)² = ½ m Ṡ² – m (γ/2) S Ṡ + ½ m (γ²/4) S².\n\nThe middle term is a total time derivative since\n\n  d/dt (½ m (γ/2) S²) = m (γ/2) S Ṡ.\n\nThus, we can drop the total time derivative (since it does not affect the equations of motion) to obtain an equivalent Lagrangian\n\n  L' = ½ m Ṡ² – ½ [k – m(γ²/4)] S².\n\nNow the new Lagrangian L' is time independent. Its corresponding Euler–Lagrange equation is straightforward:\n\n  d/dt (∂L'/∂Ṡ) – ∂L'/∂S = 0,\n\nwith\n\n  ∂L'/∂Ṡ = m Ṡ  and  ∂L'/∂S = – [k – m(γ²/4)] S.\n\nThus, the equation of motion for S is\n\n  m S̈ + [k – m(γ²/4)] S = 0  ⟹  S̈ + ω'² S = 0,\n \nwhere\n\n  ω'² = k/m – γ²/4.\n\nConstants of Motion:  \nBecause the new Lagrangian L' is time independent, the energy in terms of S is conserved. In other words, if we define\n\n  E_S = ½ m Ṡ² + ½ [k – m(γ²/4)] S²,\n \nthen dE_S/dt = 0.\n\n────────────────────────────── Step 3. Comparing the Two Descriptions ─────────────────────────────\n\nIn the original coordinate q the equation is\n\n  m q̈ + γ m q̇ + kq = 0,\n\nwhich describes a damped oscillator with no conserved “energy.” Its general solution can be written as\n\n  q(t) = e^(–γt/2)[A cos(ωt) + B sin(ωt)],\n   with ω = √(k/m – γ²/4).\n\nThe transformation S = e^(γt/2) q removes the explicit time‐dependence (and thus the effective damping) from the Lagrangian: in coordinate S the Lagrangian is that of a simple harmonic oscillator with frequency ω' = √(k/m – γ²/4) and with a conserved energy. The solutions are related by\n\n  q(t) = e^(–γt/2) S(t).\n\nThus, even though the physical motion described by q(t) appears damped, the transformation \"absorbs\" the damping factor. In S–space the dynamics are conservative, and the two descriptions are equivalent with the S coordinate being a “dressed” coordinate. The apparently dissipative behavior in q(t) is entirely due to the explicit time–dependence of the original Lagrangian.\n\n────────────────────────────── Final Answer ─────────────────────────────\n\n1. In the q–coordinate the Lagrangian is\n\n  L = e^(γt) [½ m (q̇)² – ½ k q²],\n\nleading to the Euler–Lagrange equation\n\n  m q̈ + γ m q̇ + kq = 0.\n\nThere is no conserved energy because L depends explicitly on time; the general solution is\n\n  q(t) = e^(–γt/2)[A cos(ωt) + B sin(ωt)], with ω = √(k/m – γ²/4).\n\n2. In the new coordinate S defined by S = e^(γt/2) q, the Lagrangian becomes (up to a total time derivative)\n\n  L' = ½ m Ṡ² – ½ [k – m(γ²/4)] S²,\n\nso that the Euler–Lagrange equation is\n\n  m S̈ + [k – m(γ²/4)] S = 0\n   or  S̈ + (k/m – γ²/4) S = 0.\n\nBecause L′ is time independent, the energy\n\n  E_S = ½ m Ṡ² + ½ [k – m(γ²/4)] S²\n\nis conserved.\n\n3. The relationship between the two solutions is given by the transformation q = e^(–γt/2) S. Thus the q–solution is “damped” by the exponential factor, even though the S–solution is that of an ordinary (undamped) harmonic oscillator.

{"id": "mechanics/3_7", "solution": "We might initially think that a moving sphere would appear squashed by the usual Lorentz contraction along the direction of motion. However, when one takes into account the effects of the finite speed of light – that light from different parts of the sphere reaches the observer at different times – one finds that the visual appearance is quite different. (This is often called the Terrell–Penrose effect.)\n\nStep 1. In the rest frame of the sphere it is a perfect sphere of radius R₀. Naively, applying Lorentz contraction would lead one to expect that, when the sphere is moving with speed v, dimensions parallel to v are contracted by the factor γ⁻¹ = √(1 – v²/c²). In a coordinate transformation, the sphere’s world‐tube indeed is “squeezed” along the direction of motion.\n\nStep 2. However, what an observer “sees” in a photograph is not an instantaneous snapshot in the sphere’s rest frame; rather, it is the collection of light rays arriving simultaneously at the observer. Because light from the back of the sphere left at a different time than light from the front (when the sphere was in a different position in its motion), the observer effectively sees light emanating from points that were not all “simultaneous” in the rest frame of the sphere.\n\nStep 3. Terrell and Penrose showed that these light‐travel time effects exactly “undo” the apparent flattening one might expect from a naive Lorentz contraction. The result is that the sphere appears as a sphere (its outline remains circular) even when moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. However, even though the outline is circular, the markings on the sphere will appear “rotated” or distorted relative to their positions on a stationary sphere.\n\nStep 4.

{"id": "mechanics/2_21", "solution": "We wish to know how far the “free” mass m₂ moves (its net displacement) from its starting point until, after receiving a kick only on m₁, it comes to a momentary stop (its velocity becomes zero after it has been set in motion). (b) then asks if it is possible by a single, very‐short impulse on m₁ to “set” the two–mass system into pure rotation (i.e. with no relative oscillation of the spring).\n\nIn what follows we work through the derivation step by step.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Setting Up the Problem\n\nBefore the impulse the two masses (m₁ and m₂) are at rest on a frictionless surface, and the spring is unstretched. An impulse I (a very short force, depositing net momentum I) is delivered to mass m₁ in the direction from m₁ toward m₂. (We take the positive x–direction to be from m₁ toward m₂.) Thus, immediately after the impulse the velocities are\n\n  m₁: v₁(0) = I/m₁\n\n  m₂: v₂(0) = 0    (since m₂ receives nothing directly)\n\nBecause the spring is light and initially unextended its potential energy is zero, and the only momentum initially present is I (carried by m₁).\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Decomposition into Center‐of–Mass and Relative Coordinates\n\nIt is very useful to split the motion into that of the center of mass (CM) and that of the relative coordinate. Define\n\n  Center–of–mass coordinate: X = (m₁x₁ + m₂x₂)/(m₁+m₂)\n\n  Relative coordinate:    q = x₂ – x₁\n\nSince the external impulse gives the whole system a momentum I, the CM moves with a constant velocity\n\n  V = X˙ = I/(m₁+m₂).\n\nNext, we write the positions of m₁ and m₂ in terms of X and q. A useful (and standard) choice is\n\n  x₁ = X – (m₂/(m₁+m₂)) q   and  x₂ = X + (m₁/(m₁+m₂)) q.\n\nDifferentiate with respect to time to obtain the velocities:\n  x₁˙ = V – (m₂/(m₁+m₂)) q˙   and  x₂˙ = V + (m₁/(m₁+m₂)) q˙.\n\nAt t = 0 we have x₁˙(0) = I/m₁ and x₂˙(0) = 0. Since X˙ = I/(m₁+m₂), we obtain from the expression for x₁˙:\n  I/m₁ = I/(m₁+m₂) – (m₂/(m₁+m₂)) q˙(0).\nSolve for q˙(0):\n  (m₂/(m₁+m₂)) q˙(0) = I/(m₁+m₂) – I/m₁,\n  q˙(0) = (I/(m₁+m₂)) (1 – (m₁+m₂)/m₁)\n       = (I/(m₁+m₂)) ( (m₁ – (m₁+m₂))/m₁ )\n       = – I/m₁.\nThus, the initial conditions are\n\n  q(0) = 0         (spring unstretched)\n  q˙(0) = – I/m₁.\n\nThe minus sign tells us that, immediately after the kick, the relative coordinate (q = x₂ – x₁) is decreasing (since m₁ is getting a “head‐start” toward m₂).\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 3. The Oscillations of the Spring\n\nThe only force acting between the masses is the spring force. One can show that the relative motion obeys a harmonic–oscillator equation. In fact, in the “internal” frame the two masses interact via an effective mass μ given by\n  μ = (m₁ m₂)/(m₁+m₂),\nand the relative coordinate obeys:\n  q¨ + ω² q = 0,  with ω² = k/μ = k (m₁+m₂)/(m₁ m₂).\n\nThus the solution for q(t) is\n  q(t) = A cos(ωt) + B sin(ωt),\nwith the initial conditions:\n  q(0) = 0 ⇒ A = 0,\n  q˙(0) = Bω = –I/m₁ ⇒ B = – I/(m₁ ω).\nHence,\n  q(t) = –(I/(m₁ ω)) sin(ωt).\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 4. The Motion of m₂ and the Instant It Stops\n\nWe want to know how much m₂ has moved (i.e. the net displacement Δx₂) by the first time after t = 0 that its velocity goes to zero.\n\nRecall from Step 2 that\n  x₂ = X + (m₁/(m₁+m₂)) q,\nand therefore\n  x₂˙ = X˙ + (m₁/(m₁+m₂)) q˙ = I/(m₁+m₂) + (m₁/(m₁+m₂)) q˙.\n\nBut we calculated q˙(t) from q(t):\n  q˙(t) = – (I/(m₁)) cos(ωt).\n\nThus, the velocity of m₂ becomes\n  x₂˙(t) = I/(m₁+m₂) + (m₁/(m₁+m₂)) ( – I/m₁ cos(ωt) )\n        = I/(m₁+m₂) [1 – cos(ωt)].\n\nAt t = 0, cos(0)=1 so x₂˙(0)=0, but that is the initial condition. The next (first) time that x₂˙ becomes zero (after t = 0) is when\n  1 – cos(ωt) = 0  ⟹ cos(ωt)=1.\nThe smallest positive time when cos(ωt)=1 (other than zero) is when\n  ωt = 2π  ⟹ t₁ = 2π/ω.\n\nThus, the “first stop” of m₂ (after starting from rest) is at t₁ = 2π/ω.\n\nNow, what is the displacement of m₂ at that time? We have\n  x₂(t) = X(t) + (m₁/(m₁+m₂)) q(t),\nand we already know\n  X(t)= It/(m₁+m₂).\nAt t = 2π/ω, note that q(t₁) = –(I/(m₁ ω)) sin(2π) = 0 (since sin 2π = 0). Therefore,\n  x₂(t₁) = I (2π/ω)/(m₁+m₂) + (m₁/(m₁+m₂))·0 = 2π I/[ω (m₁+m₂)].\n\nThus, the net displacement (the distance m₂ moves from rest until its next stop) is\n  Δx₂ = 2π I/[ω (m₁+m₂)].\nInserting the value of ω (recall ω = √[k(m₁+m₂)/(m₁ m₂)]) we get\n  Δx₂ = 2π I/(m₁+m₂) · √[m₁ m₂/(k(m₁+m₂)] = (2π I √(m₁ m₂))/(√k (m₁+m₂)^(3/2)).\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 5. Answer to (b)\n\nNow, part (b) asks: Is it possible by delivering a short impulse to m₁ to have the system move “from rest” so that it is rotating without oscillation?\n\nThe idea of “rotating without oscillation” is that the system (viz. the two masses connected by the spring) undergoes pure rotation about the center‐of–mass with the spring remaining unstretched (i.e. in equilibrium) at all times. In order for the spring never to be excited, the “internal” motion must be absent. In the language used above, this would require that the relative coordinate q remain equal to zero for all time, and hence q˙ = 0 as well. (Because if q is nonzero or oscillatory, the spring stretches and the system oscillates.)\n\nNow, the only way to have q(t) ≡ 0 is to set the two mass velocities to the “rigid–body” values:\n  x₁˙ = X˙ – (m₂/(m₁+m₂)) · 0 = V,\n  x₂˙ = X˙ + (m₁/(m₁+m₂)) · 0 = V,\nthat is, both masses must have the same velocity V = I/(m₁+m₂) (the center–of–mass velocity).\n\nHowever, as we have seen, delivering an impulse only to m₁ gives\n  x₁˙(0) = I/m₁  and  x₂˙(0)= 0,\nwhich clearly do not satisfy x₁˙(0) = x₂˙(0) unless m₁ = m₁+m₂ (i.e. m₂ = 0). Thus a single short impulse on m₁ necessarily leaves a nonzero initial “internal” velocity q˙(0) = –I/m₁ (i.e. not both masses moving together) and so excites the spring oscillation.\n\nTherefore, one cannot, by means of a single short impulse on one mass, set the system into pure rotation (with the spring at equilibrium throughout) because the impulse automatically produces the initial conditions which excite the vibrational (spring–oscillation) mode.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The displacement of m₂ before it comes to rest for the first time is\n\n  Δx₂ = (2π I √(m₁ m₂))/(√k (m₁+m₂)^(3/2)).\n\n(b) No, it is not possible. A short impulse on m₁ alone necessarily excites oscillations of the spring; to have a pure rotational (non–oscillatory) mode one must have the two masses moving together (i.e. with no relative motion) from the start, which cannot be arranged by an impulse on m₁ only.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Latex Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad \\Delta x_2 &= \\frac{2\\pi I}{\\omega(m_1+m_2)}\n=\\frac{2\\pi I \\sqrt{m_1m_2}}{\\sqrt{k}\\,(m_1+m_2)^{3/2}},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{No. A short impulse on } m_1 \\text{ necessarily excites the spring’s internal (oscillatory) mode.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad \\Delta x_2 &= \\frac{2\\pi I}{\\omega(m_1+m_2)}\n=\\frac{2\\pi I \\sqrt{m_1m_2}}{\\sqrt{k}\\,(m_1+m_2)^{3/2}},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{No. A short impulse on } m_1 \\text{ necessarily excites the spring’s internal (oscillatory) mode.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad \\Delta x_2 &= \\frac{2\\pi I}{\\omega(m_1+m_2)}\n=\\frac{2\\pi I \\sqrt{m_1m_2}}{\\sqrt{k}\\,(m_1+m_2)^{3/2}},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{No. A short impulse on } m_1 \\text{ necessarily excites the spring’s internal (oscillatory) mode.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "2\\pi I \\sqrt{\\frac{m_1 m_2}{k}} (m_1 + m_2)^{-3/2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Now the energy transforms as\n  E = γ (E₀ − β c p_x) = γ (E₀ − β E₀) = γ (1 − β) E₀.\nThus,\n  ν = γ (1 − β) ν₀.\nAgain, writing\n  γ (1 − β) = √((1 − β)/(1 + β)),\nwe obtain\n  ν = ν₀ √((1 − β)/(1 + β)).\n\nCase (iii): Perpendicular configuration\n-----------------------------------------\nConsider now the case when the photon is emitted in a direction perpendicular to the relative motion (say along the y‑axis) while the relative boost is along the x‑axis. In the source rest frame, the photon’s 4‑momentum is\n  p^μ = (E₀/c, 0, E₀/c, 0).\nUnder a boost in the x‑direction, its x‑component becomes (using p′_x = γ(p_x − β E₀/c)) \n  p′_x = −γβ (E₀/c),\nbut the energy transforms as\n  E′ = γ (E₀ − β c·0) = γ E₀.\nSince the frequency is given by ν = E′/h, we have\n  ν = γ ν₀,\nor equivalently,\n  ν = ν₀/√(1 − β²).\n\n──────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n──────────────────────────\n(a) The Lorentz transformation for the position 4‑vector is\n\n  ct′ = γ (ct – βx),  x′ = γ (x – βct),  y′ = y,  z′ = z.\n\nThus the momentum 4‑vector transforms as\n\n  E′ = γ (E − β c p_x),  p′_x = γ (p_x − β E/c),  p′_y = p_y,  p′_z = p_z.\n\n(b) For light (with E = hν):\n\ni) Approaching:\n  ν = ν₀ √((1 + β)/(1 − β)).\n\nii) Receding:\n  ν = ν₀ √((1 − β)/(1 + β)).\n\niii) Perpendicular:\n  ν = ν₀/√(1 − β²).\n\n──────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Boxed LaTeX\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} \\quad &\\text{Position 4-vector: }\\, ct' = \\gamma(ct-\\beta x),\\quad x'=\\gamma(x-\\beta ct),\\quad y'=y,\\quad z'=z,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{Momentum 4-vector: }\\, E'=\\gamma(E-\\beta c\\,p_x),\\quad p'_x=\\gamma(p_x-\\beta E/c),\\quad p'_y=p_y,\\quad p'_z=p_z.\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)} \\quad &\\text{(i) Approaching: }\\, \\nu = \\nu_0\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(ii) Receding: }\\, \\nu = \\nu_0\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\beta}{1+\\beta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(iii) Perpendicular: }\\, \\nu = \\frac{\\nu_0}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} \\quad &\\text{Position 4-vector: }\\, ct' = \\gamma(ct-\\beta x),\\quad x'=\\gamma(x-\\beta ct),\\quad y'=y,\\quad z'=z,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{Momentum 4-vector: }\\, E'=\\gamma(E-\\beta c\\,p_x),\\quad p'_x=\\gamma(p_x-\\beta E/c),\\quad p'_y=p_y,\\quad p'_z=p_z.\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)} \\quad &\\text{(i) Approaching: }\\, \\nu = \\nu_0\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(ii) Receding: }\\, \\nu = \\nu_0\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\beta}{1+\\beta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(iii) Perpendicular: }\\, \\nu = \\frac{\\nu_0}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} \\quad &\\text{Position 4-vector: }\\, ct' = \\gamma(ct-\\beta x),\\quad x'=\\gamma(x-\\beta ct),\\quad y'=y,\\quad z'=z,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{Momentum 4-vector: }\\, E'=\\gamma(E-\\beta c\\,p_x),\\quad p'_x=\\gamma(p_x-\\beta E/c),\\quad p'_y=p_y,\\quad p'_z=p_z.\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)} \\quad &\\text{(i) Approaching: }\\, \\nu = \\nu_0\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(ii) Receding: }\\, \\nu = \\nu_0\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\beta}{1+\\beta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(iii) Perpendicular: }\\, \\nu = \\frac{\\nu_0}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "x^\\alpha = Q^\\alpha_\\beta x'^\\beta = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\gamma & 0 & 0 & -\\beta \\gamma \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\beta \\gamma & 0 & 0 & \\gamma\n\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\nz \\\\\nct\n\\end{pmatrix}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} \\quad &\\text{Position 4-vector: }\\, ct' = \\gamma(ct-\\beta x),\\quad x'=\\gamma(x-\\beta ct),\\quad y'=y,\\quad z'=z,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{Momentum 4-vector: }\\, E'=\\gamma(E-\\beta c\\,p_x),\\quad p'_x=\\gamma(p_x-\\beta E/c),\\quad p'_y=p_y,\\quad p'_z=p_z.\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)} \\quad &\\text{(i) Approaching: }\\, \\nu = \\nu_0\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(ii) Receding: }\\, \\nu = \\nu_0\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\beta}{1+\\beta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(iii) Perpendicular: }\\, \\nu = \\frac{\\nu_0}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\begin{pmatrix}\np'_x c \\\\\np'_y c \\\\\np'_z c \\\\\nE\n\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\gamma (p_x c - \\beta E) \\\\\np_y c \\\\\np_z c \\\\\n\\gamma (E - \\beta p_x c)\n\\end{pmatrix}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "mechanics/1_98", "solution": "We wish to show that when a coin is given a push “toward the center” of a rotating disk, its path as seen by someone on the disk (i.e. in the rotating frame) is approximately a parabola. We shall assume that the disk rotates with constant angular velocity ω and that the push is given so that the coin’s initial speed relative to the disk is V (directed radially inward). In addition, we assume that the time of observation t is so short that (ωt)² is negligible. (This means that although first‐order effects in ωt such as the Coriolis force matter, the centrifugal acceleration ∼ω² can be neglected.)\n\nBelow is one way to arrive at the answer step by step.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Set Up the Coordinates\n\nA natural choice is to use a coordinate system fixed to the disk (the rotating frame) with its origin at the center of the disk. Suppose that a person on the disk is at the point (R, 0) (in Cartesian coordinates). At the moment t = 0 the coin is at the same point as the person (i.e. at (R, 0)) and is given a push “toward the origin.” In our coordinate system “toward the origin” means in the negative x‐direction. Thus the coin’s initial velocity (relative to the rotating frame) is\n  x′(0)= –V  and  y′(0)= 0.\n(Here a prime denotes differentiation with respect to time.)\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Write the Equations of Motion in the Rotating Frame\n\nIn a rotating frame the coin (which is moving freely in space once pushed) is subject to fictitious forces. In particular, if the inertial acceleration is zero (since no forces act on the coin after the push) then the acceleration in the rotating frame is given by\n\n  a_rot = -2ω×v_rot – ω×(ω×r_rot).\n\nSince we are instructed to neglect terms of order (ωt)², we may neglect the centrifugal term ω×(ω×r) (which is O(ω²)) and retain only the Coriolis force term. (We also note that dω/dt = 0 since ω is constant.) Thus we have\n\n  r″ = –2ω×r′.\n\nTaking ω = (0, 0, ω) (pointing upward) and writing r = (x, y) in the plane, we compute\n\n  ω×r′ = (ω v_y, – ω v_x, 0),\nso that\n  –2ω×r′ = (–2ω v_y, 2ω v_x).\n\nThus the equations of motion in the rotating frame become\n\n  x″ = –2ω y′   (1)\n  y″ =  2ω x′   (2)\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Solve the Equations to First Order in ωt\n\nNotice that at t = 0 the initial conditions are\n  x(0) = R,   y(0) = 0,\n  x′(0) = –V,  y′(0) = 0.\n\nSince the x acceleration (1) is proportional to y′ and y′(0) = 0, the change in x motion due to the ω term is higher order in ω. Therefore, to first order in ωt we can approximate\n\n  x(t) ≈ R – Vt.   (3)\n\nNow turn to (2): Since x′(t) is initially –V and changes little during the short time t (by our approximation), we approximate x′ ≈ –V in (2). Thus\n\n  y″ ≈ 2ω (–V) = –2ω V.\n\nIntegrate with respect to time:\n  y′(t) ≈ y′(0) + ∫₀ᵗ y″ dt = 0 – 2ωV t = –2ω V t,\nand\n  y(t) ≈ y(0) + ∫₀ᵗ y′(t) dt = 0 – ωV t² = –ωV t².   (4)\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Eliminate Time to Find the Path Equation\n\nFrom (3) we solve for t:\n  t ≈ (R – x)/V.\nPlug this expression into (4) for y(t):\n\n  y = –ωV ((R – x)/V)² = – (ω/V) (R – x)².\n\nThus, the coin’s trajectory as seen by a person on the disk is\n\n  y = – (ω/V) (R – x)².\n\nThis is the equation of a parabola.

{"id": "mechanics/1_53", "solution": "We can “weigh” and “map” celestial bodies by careful study of the motion of satellites or planets and by using the laws of gravitation and orbital mechanics. Let’s explain each case in detail.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (a): Determining the Mass of the Earth\n\nOne standard method is to study the orbital motion of an artificial satellite. In a circular orbit around the Earth, the gravitational force provides the centripetal acceleration. In other words, if a satellite of negligible mass is at a distance r from the Earth’s center and moves with speed v, we have\n\n  (GM_E)/r² = v²/r,\n\nwhere G is the universal gravitational constant and M_E is the mass of the Earth. Rearranging, one finds:\n\n  GM_E = r·v².\n\nIf r and v are measured (or, equivalently, if the orbital period is known) then one immediately deduces GM_E. This quantity is known to high precision. Alternatively, by measuring the gravitational acceleration g at the Earth's surface and knowing the earth’s radius R_E, one uses the relation:\n\n  g = GM_E/R_E²  →  M_E = g R_E²/G.\n\nBoth methods rest on quantities that are measured very accurately: r (or the period), v (or g) and R_E.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (b): Determining the Mass of the Moon\n\nA similar method is applied to the Moon. For instance, if an orbiting spacecraft is in a circular orbit around the Moon at a distance r_m from its center (with speed v_m), then\n\n  G M_Moon = r_m · v_m².\n\nFrom an analysis of the spacecraft’s tracking data one obtains r_m and v_m (or the orbital period) and thus can determine the Moon’s gravitational parameter GM_Moon. In an alternative method one can analyze the orbital motion of the Moon around the Earth. The Earth–Moon system revolves about their common center of mass and “weighing” the Moon can be achieved by using Kepler’s third law for the orbit of the Moon about the Earth, along with the known mass of the Earth. (In practice, however, the most precise values come from spacecraft tracking.)\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (c): Determining the Distance from the Earth to the Sun\n\nThe distance from the Earth to the Sun is known as the astronomical unit (AU). There are several methods for determining the AU:\n\n• Historically, one of the first methods used was to observe the transit of Venus across the face of the Sun from different points on the Earth. The slight difference in the observed path (parallax) allowed one to deduce the distance to Venus and hence, using Kepler’s laws, the distance to the Sun.\n\n• In modern times, radar observations are used. Radar pulses are sent from Earth and timed as they bounce off a nearby planet (such as Venus). The measured round‐trip time, combined with the known speed of light, gives the distance to that planet. Then, using the detailed geometry of the solar system and Kepler’s laws, one deduces the AU very precisely.\n\nBoth techniques depend on measurable quantities – such as angles (for parallax) or time delays (for radar pulses) – that can be determined with high accuracy.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer\n\nIn summary, \n• (a) the Earth’s mass is determined from the measured acceleration of free fall (or from the orbital speed and radius of satellites) using \n  GM_E = r v² →  M_E = gR_E²/G;\n• (b) the Moon’s mass is found by tracking the orbit of a spacecraft around the Moon (or by analyzing the Earth–Moon orbital motion) so that \n  GM_Moon = r_m v_m²;\n• (c) the distance from the Earth to the Sun (the AU) is measured by geometric parallax (e.g. via Venus transits) or by radar ranging to nearby planets combined with Kepler’s laws.\n\nThus, we have:\n\n  \\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) } M_E = \\dfrac{g\\, R_E^2}{G} \\text{ (or by using } GM_E = r\\, v^2\\text{ from satellite orbits)}. \\\\\n\\text{(b) } M_{\\text{Moon}} \\text{ is obtained by determining } GM_{\\text{Moon}} = r_m \\, v_m^2 \\text{ from the motion of orbiters or the Moon’s orbit.} \\\\\n\\text{(c) The Earth–Sun distance (AU) is found via parallax methods (e.g. Venus transit observations) or by radar ranging and using Kepler’s laws.}\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) } M_E = \\dfrac{g\\, R_E^2}{G} \\text{ (or by using } GM_E = r\\, v^2\\text{ from satellite orbits)}. \\\\\n\\text{(b) } M_{\\text{Moon}} \\text{ is obtained by determining } GM_{\\text{Moon}} = r_m \\, v_m^2 \\text{ from the motion of orbiters or the Moon’s orbit.} \\\\\n\\text{(c) The Earth–Sun distance (AU) is found via parallax methods (e.g. Venus transit observations) or by radar ranging and using Kepler’s laws.}\n\\end{array}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) } M_E = \\dfrac{g\\, R_E^2}{G} \\text{ (or by using } GM_E = r\\, v^2\\text{ from satellite orbits)}. \\\\\n\\text{(b) } M_{\\text{Moon}} \\text{ is obtained by determining } GM_{\\text{Moon}} = r_m \\, v_m^2 \\text{ from the motion of orbiters or the Moon’s orbit.} \\\\\n\\text{(c) The Earth–Sun distance (AU) is found via parallax methods (e.g. Venus transit observations) or by radar ranging and using Kepler’s laws.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "m_e = \\frac{gR^2}{G}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Consider a particle with initial speed V₀ at infinity and with an impact parameter b. Because of gravitational focusing, the particle’s path is bent and, if b is not too large, the particle can hit the moon.\n\nStep 2. Since angular momentum is conserved, the initial angular momentum is\n  L = b V₀.\nAt the moment of collision with the moon (assumed to occur at r = R) the angular momentum is \n  L = R Vₜ,\nwhere Vₜ is the tangential velocity at the point of impact.\n\nStep 3. Energy conservation tells us that the total energy at infinity is the same as that near the moon. At infinity the kinetic energy is (1/2) m V₀². At the surface of the moon the particle has both tangential and radial kinetic energy, but it is convenient to note that (by energy conservation) the speed at the surface, Vₘ, satisfies:\n  ½ Vₘ² = ½ V₀² + GM/R,\nwhere the escape speed from the surface is given by\n  Vₑₛc² = 2GM/R.\nThus, we have\n  Vₘ² = V₀² + Vₑₛc².\n\nStep 4. In the limit of a grazing collision (i.e. the maximum impact parameter at which a collision occurs), the entire velocity at r = R can be taken to be tangential (since if the particle never “misses”, it must have just enough angular momentum to barely hit the surface). That is, we set Vₜ = Vₘ. Then using conservation of angular momentum:\n  b_max V₀ = R √(V₀² + Vₑₛc²).\nSolving for b_max, we find:\n  b_max = R √(1 + (Vₑₛc/V₀)²).\n\nStep 5. The collision cross section is then simply the area corresponding to this maximum impact parameter:\n  σ = π b_max² = πR² [1 + (Vₑₛc/V₀)²].\n\nStep 6.

Find a scaling transformation under which the Lagrangian is invariant up to an overall constant and deduce Kepler’s third law.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Lagrangian in Cartesian Coordinates\n\nThe Lagrangian is the difference between the kinetic energy and potential energy. The kinetic energy is\n  T = (1/2)m₁|ṙ₁|² + (1/2)m₂|ṙ₂|².\nThe gravitational potential energy is\n  V = –(G m₁ m₂)/|r₁ – r₂|.\nTherefore, the Lagrangian is\n  L = T – V\n    = (1/2)m₁|ṙ₁|² + (1/2)m₂|ṙ₂|² + (G m₁ m₂)/|r₁ – r₂|.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Homogeneity of the Potential Energy\n\nWe must show that if we scale both coordinates by a constant α, then\n  V(α r₁, α r₂) = α^(–1) V(r₁, r₂).\n\nLet us check:\n  V(α r₁, α r₂) = –(G m₁ m₂) / |αr₁ – αr₂|\n    = –(G m₁ m₂) / (α |r₁ – r₂|)\n    = α^(–1) [ –(G m₁ m₂)/|r₁ – r₂| ]\n    = α^(–1) V(r₁, r₂).\n\nThus, the gravitational potential energy is homogeneous of degree –1.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Scaling Transformation and Kepler’s Third Law\n\nWe now search for a transformation in (r, t) which leaves the form of the Lagrangian unchanged, up to an overall multiplicative constant. We perform a scaling:\n  r → α r      (so each rᵢ → α rᵢ)\nand \n  t → β t\nwith β to be determined.\n\nUnder this transformation, the velocities transform as follows:\n  ṙ = dr/dt → d(α r)/(dt') = α (dr/dt') and note that dt' = β dt, so \n  ṙ → (α/β) ṙ.\n\nThus, the kinetic energy transforms as:\n  T = (1/2) m₁|ṙ₁|² + (1/2)m₂|ṙ₂|²  → (1/2) m₁ (α/β)² |ṙ₁|² + (1/2)m₂ (α/β)² |ṙ₂|²  = (α²/β²) T.\n \nWe have already seen that the potential energy scales as:\n  V → α^(–1) V.\n\nNow, if the Lagrangian L = T – V transforms into an overall multiplicative constant times L, then the physics (Euler–Lagrange equations) remains unchanged (since only the action’s extremal property matters). That is, we demand a scaled Lagrangian:\n  L' = (α²/β²) T – α^(–1) V = λ (T – V),\nwhere λ is an overall multiplicative constant (it does not affect the equations of motion).\n\nFor this to occur for arbitrary T and V we have to choose β (as a function of α) such that the factors before T and V are equal (except for the overall constant λ). In other words, we want\n  (α²/β²) = α^(–1).\nSolve for β:\n  α²/β² = α^(–1) ⟹ β² = α² / α^(–1) = α³,\n  which means\n  β = α^(3/2).\n\nThus, the transformation is\n  r → α r   and  t → α^(3/2) t.\nUnder this scaling the Lagrangian changes as\n  L → α^(–1) L.\nSince the Euler–Lagrange equations are invariant under an overall constant factor multiplying the Lagrangian, the physics remains unchanged.\n\nNow, consider a binary orbit of “size” a (where a is, for instance, the semi‐major axis of the relative coordinate). Under the scaling r → α r, we have a → α a. At the same time time scales as t → α^(3/2) t, so the period T (not to be confused with the kinetic energy) must satisfy:\n  T ∝ a^(3/2).\n\nSquaring both sides yields:\n  T² ∝ a³,\nwhich is exactly Kepler’s Third Law.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n(a) The Lagrangian is\n\n  L = ½ m₁|ṙ₁|² + ½ m₂|ṙ₂|² + (G m₁ m₂)/|r₁ – r₂|.\n\n(b) Under the scaling rᵢ → α rᵢ, the potential energy becomes\n  V(α r₁, α r₂) = –(G m₁ m₂)/(α|r₁ – r₂|) = α^(–1)V(r₁, r₂),\nshowing that it is homogeneous of degree –1.\n\n(c) The transformation\n\n  r → α r,  t → α^(3/2) t\nleaves the Lagrangian invariant up to an overall multiplying constant.

{"id": "mechanics/3_6", "solution": "We wish to know how long after an Earth‐emitted radio pulse is “received” by a receding spaceship moving at v = 0.8c, and where the ship is when it receives the signal. (We assume that when the signal is sent the spaceship is a distance\n\n  d = 6.66×10^8 km away from Earth, as measured in the Earth‐frame.)\n\nIn what follows we will work in two “pictures” (frames):\n\n• The Earth frame (S) in which Earth is at rest.\n• The spaceship’s frame (S′) in which the ship is at rest.\n\nIn the Earth frame the signal travels at speed c (≈3.00×10^5 km/s) while the spaceship departs Earth at speed v = 0.8c (≈2.40×10^5 km/s).\n\nWe shall first solve the problem in the Earth frame, then “translate” into the ship frame (taking care to choose coordinates so that the ship is at rest at x′ = 0).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Earth‑Frame Analysis\n\nLet t = 0 in the Earth frame when the radio signal is sent from x = 0. At that moment the ship is at \n  x(0) = d = 6.66×10^8 km.\nFor t > 0 the spaceship moves at constant speed so that\n  x_ship(t) = d + v t.\nMeanwhile the radio signal moves (from Earth) as\n  x_signal(t) = c t.\nThe signal “catches” the spaceship when these two positions agree. Hence we set\n\n  c t = d + v t \n  ⇒ t (c – v) = d \n  ⇒ t = d/(c – v).\n\nNow, inserting numerical values:\n  c – v = 3.00×10^5 km/s – 2.40×10^5 km/s = 0.60×10^5 km/s = 6.0×10^4 km/s,\nso\n  t = (6.66×10^8 km)/(6.0×10^4 km/s) = 1.11×10^4 s.\n\nThus, in the Earth frame the signal reaches the spaceship at\n\n  t_R = 1.11×10^4 s.\n\nAt that time the spaceship is at\n  x_R = d + v t_R = (6.66×10^8 km) + (2.40×10^5 km/s)(1.11×10^4 s).\n\nLet us check the product:\n  (2.40×10^5 km/s)(1.11×10^4 s) = 2.664×10^9 km.\nThus,\n  x_R = 6.66×10^8 km + 2.664×10^9 km = 3.33×10^9 km.\n\nSo, in the Earth frame:\n (a) The signal takes 1.11×10^4 s (≈3.08 hours) to catch the spaceship;\n (b) The spaceship’s position when it receives the signal is x = 3.33×10^9 km.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Transforming to the Ship’s Frame\n\nNow it is sometimes asked “How long does the ship take to receive the signal as measured in its own (proper) rest frame?” Since the radio‐emission event does not occur on the ship’s worldline we must be a bit careful. A very common procedure is as follows. (Any answer equivalent to what follows is acceptable.)\n\nWe wish to assign ship–frame “time coordinates” to the two events:\n  Event E_em: Earth emits the signal.\n  Event E_rec: The ship receives the signal.\n\nBecause the ship is not present when the signal is sent (E_em is not on the ship’s worldline) one has to be explicit about the synchronization of clocks in the ship’s frame. A common choice is to adopt coordinates so that, on the ship’s worldline, its proper time τ agrees with the time coordinate t′; that is, we insist that when the ship receives the signal it is at x′ = 0 and its clock reads t′ = τ_R.\n\nOne very natural “shift” is to define the ship’s coordinates by “placing the origin” on the ship’s worldline. In the Earth frame the ship’s worldline is\n\n  x_ship(t) = d + v t,\nwith the ship at time t having its own proper time τ. To define coordinates in S′ in which the ship’s worldline is given by x′ = 0, we choose the coordinate transformation (a “shifted Lorentz transformation”) so that the event on the ship’s worldline at t = 0 in Earth’s frame is assigned the ship–frame coordinates (t′ = 0, x′ = 0). (In the usual Lorentz transformation the origins of the two frames are chosen to coincide; here the ship is not at x = 0 at t = 0 so we “shift” the coordinates by d.) One convenient transformation is\n\n  t′ = γ [ t − (v/c²)(x − d) ]     (1)\n  x′ = γ [ (x − d) − v t ],      (2)\nwhere\n  γ = 1/√(1 − v²/c²) = 1/√(1 − 0.64) = 1/0.6 ≈ 1.667.\n\nWith these definitions the ship is always at x′ = 0 because if x = d + v t then from (2)\n  x′ = γ [ (d + v t − d) − v t ] = γ (v t − v t) = 0.\n\nNow, with these coordinates we compute the S′–time coordinate for the two events.\n\n• For the emission event, E_em, we have in the Earth frame: t = 0 and x = 0.\nThen from (1)\n  t′_em = γ [ 0 − (v/c²)(0 − d) ] = γ [ (v d)/c² ].\nPlug in v = 0.8 c so that\n  t′_em = γ (0.8 d/c)   [since v/c² = 0.8/c].\nNow, d = 6.66×10^8 km and c = 3.00×10^5 km/s so that\n  d/c = (6.66×10^8 km)/(3.00×10^5 km/s) = 2220 s.\nThus,\n  t′_em = 1.667 × (0.8 × 2220 s) = 1.667 × 1776 s ≈ 2960 s.\n\n• For the reception event, E_rec, we already have in the Earth frame:\n  t_R = 1.11×10^4 s,\n  x_R = 3.33×10^9 km.\nThen from (1)\n  t′_rec = γ [ t_R − (v/c²)(x_R − d) ].\nLet us compute the factor (v/c²)(x_R − d). Notice that\n  x_R − d = (3.33×10^9 – 6.66×10^8) km = 2.664×10^9 km.\nAlso,\n  (v/c²) = (0.8c)/c² = 0.8/c.\nThus,\n  (v/c²)(x_R − d) = 0.8 (2.664×10^9 km)/(3.00×10^5 km/s) = 0.8 × 8880 s = 7104 s.\nNow,\n  t′_rec = 1.667 [ 1.11×10^4 s – 7104 s ] = 1.667 × 3996 s ≈ 6660 s.\n\nSo, although the Earth sees the signal take t_R = 11,100 s to catch up with the ship, in the ship’s coordinate system the radio–emission event is not simultaneous with t′ = 0. In our chosen ship coordinates the emission event occurs at t′_em ≈ 2960 s and the reception event at t′_rec ≈ 6660 s. (This “lack of simultaneity” is the well–known relativity of simultaneity.) Thus the time elapsed between the event “Earth emits the radio signal” (as assigned in the ship frame) and “the ship receives it” is\n\n  Δt′ = t′_rec − t′_em ≈ 6660 s − 2960 s = 3700 s.\n\nThis is the interval that one “assigns” in the ship frame between the emission event and the reception event (even though the emission did not occur physically at the ship’s location). On the other hand, the interval which is the proper time along the ship’s worldline – measured by a clock aboard the ship – is that elapsed between events on the ship’s worldline. Since the ship is at x′ = 0 by construction, the clock on board simply reads t′ = 6660 s when the signal arrives. (One could “reset” the ship’s clock arbitrarily; it is the difference between the ship–time assigned to the two events (by the chosen global synchronization in the ship frame) that is here 3700 s.)\n\nThus we can answer as follows:\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(a) In the ship’s reference frame the time difference between the “emission” (as assigned by that frame) and the signal’s “reception” at the ship is about 3700 s.\n\n(b) In the Earth’s reference frame the signal takes\n\n  t = d/(c–v) = 1.11×10^4 s\n\nto reach the spaceship.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3.

{"id": "mechanics/3_1", "solution": "We can break down the answer as follows:\n\n────────────────────────\n(a) The core dilemma was that Maxwell’s equations predicted that light should propagate at a fixed speed c, regardless of the motion of the source. Yet Newtonian mechanics assumed that velocities add (i.e. via Galilean transformations) so that one would expect the speed of light to depend on the observer’s motion relative to a presumed medium. This contradiction—especially highlighted by the inability to detect any change in the speed of light due to Earth's motion through a hypothesized “luminiferous aether”—necessitated a new framework. Special relativity resolved this by postulating that the speed of light in vacuum is constant in all inertial frames and that the notions of absolute time and space must be replaced by space-time.\n────────────────────────\n(b) An earlier theory that could have, in principle, eliminated the need for special relativity was the “aether theory” (and more specifically the Lorentz Ether Theory). In this theory it was assumed that light propagates through a stationary, all-pervading medium called the aether, and that any motion through this aether would produce measurable variations in the speed of light. The famous Michelson–Morley experiment was designed to detect the Earth’s motion relative to this aether by comparing the speed of light in perpendicular directions. Its null result (i.e. the failure to detect any difference) was a strong indication that the aether did not exist as expected, thus disproving the aether theory.\n────────────────────────\n(c) Numerous modern experiments support the predictions of special relativity. One example is the modern version of the Ives–Stilwell experiment, which uses Doppler-shift measurements on fast-moving ions to test the time-dilation prediction of special relativity. In these experiments, light emitted from ions traveling at high speeds exhibits a frequency shift (both longitudinal and transverse Doppler effects) precisely as predicted by relativistic formulas. Further, modern particle accelerator experiments where particles are accelerated to near-light speeds show that their lifetimes, energies, and effective masses conform exactly to the special relativistic predictions.\n────────────────────────\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) The dilemma arose because Maxwell’s equations imply a constant light speed, independent of}\\\\\n\\text{the observer’s motion, which contradicts the Galilean addition of velocities used in Newtonian mechanics.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) The earlier “aether theory” (or Lorentz Ether Theory) assumed a stationary medium for light propagation.}\\\\\n\\text{The Michelson–Morley experiment, which failed to detect the aether wind, disproved this theory.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c) Modern experiments such as the updated Ives–Stilwell experiments, which measure Doppler shifts in}\\\\\n\\text{fast-moving ions, confirm time dilation and other predictions of special relativity.}\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) The dilemma arose because Maxwell’s equations imply a constant light speed, independent of}\\\\\n\\text{the observer’s motion, which contradicts the Galilean addition of velocities used in Newtonian mechanics.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) The earlier “aether theory” (or Lorentz Ether Theory) assumed a stationary medium for light propagation.}\\\\\n\\text{The Michelson–Morley experiment, which failed to detect the aether wind, disproved this theory.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c) Modern experiments such as the updated Ives–Stilwell experiments, which measure Doppler shifts in}\\\\\n\\text{fast-moving ions, confirm time dilation and other predictions of special relativity.}\n\\end{array}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) The dilemma arose because Maxwell’s equations imply a constant light speed, independent of}\\\\\n\\text{the observer’s motion, which contradicts the Galilean addition of velocities used in Newtonian mechanics.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) The earlier “aether theory” (or Lorentz Ether Theory) assumed a stationary medium for light propagation.}\\\\\n\\text{The Michelson–Morley experiment, which failed to detect the aether wind, disproved this theory.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c) Modern experiments such as the updated Ives–Stilwell experiments, which measure Doppler shifts in}\\\\\n\\text{fast-moving ions, confirm time dilation and other predictions of special relativity.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "\\text{The dilemma arose because either Maxwell's electromagnetic theory or Newtonian mechanics appeared to hold, but not both, since they were contrary in terms of constant velocity propagation.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) The dilemma arose because Maxwell’s equations imply a constant light speed, independent of}\\\\\n\\text{the observer’s motion, which contradicts the Galilean addition of velocities used in Newtonian mechanics.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) The earlier “aether theory” (or Lorentz Ether Theory) assumed a stationary medium for light propagation.}\\\\\n\\text{The Michelson–Morley experiment, which failed to detect the aether wind, disproved this theory.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c) Modern experiments such as the updated Ives–Stilwell experiments, which measure Doppler shifts in}\\\\\n\\text{fast-moving ions, confirm time dilation and other predictions of special relativity.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "\\text{The earlier theory was the ether theory, disproved by the Michelson experiment which showed a zero result for Earth's velocity relative to ether.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) The dilemma arose because Maxwell’s equations imply a constant light speed, independent of}\\\\\n\\text{the observer’s motion, which contradicts the Galilean addition of velocities used in Newtonian mechanics.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) The earlier “aether theory” (or Lorentz Ether Theory) assumed a stationary medium for light propagation.}\\\\\n\\text{The Michelson–Morley experiment, which failed to detect the aether wind, disproved this theory.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c) Modern experiments such as the updated Ives–Stilwell experiments, which measure Doppler shifts in}\\\\\n\\text{fast-moving ions, confirm time dilation and other predictions of special relativity.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "\\text{Herter's experiment supports special relativity by confirming simultaneous photon arrival from different directions, indicating constant light speed.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "mechanics/2_27", "solution": "We will show step‐by‐step that, for a particle constrained on the inside of a smooth paraboloid and then for a particle moving in a rotating coordinate system, one may “read off” the constraint (or fictitious) forces from the equations of motion. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nPart (a). A particle slides on the inside of the vertical paraboloid of revolution\n\n  r² = a z                   (1)\n\nIt is most convenient to write (1) in “Cartesian–cylindrical” form by noting that in cylindrical coordinates \n  r² = x² + y²,\nso that we may define a constraint function\n  f(x,y,z) = x²+y² – a z = 0.         (2)\n\nThe reaction (constraint) force must do no work and acts in a direction normal to the surface. Hence it must be proportional to the gradient of the constraint function, namely,\n  ∇f = (2x, 2y, –a).\nIn cylindrical coordinates writing \n  x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ,\nwe have\n  ∇f = (2r cosθ, 2r sinθ, –a)\nand its magnitude is\n  |∇f| = √(4r² + a²) = a√(1+4r²/a²).\n\nThus, a unit normal (pointing, say, out of the surface) is\n  n = (2r cosθ, 2r sinθ, –a)/√(4r²+a²)\nor, equivalently,\n  n = ( (2r/a) cosθ, (2r/a) sinθ, –1 )/√(1+4r²/a²).    (3)\n\nIn Lagrange’s formulation the constraint force appears as a multiplier times ∇f. One writes the force as\n  R = λ ∇f.\nThus the magnitude is\n  |R| = |λ|√(4r²+a²) = |λ| a√(1+4r²/a²).\n\nNow, if one shows by using the Lagrange–d’Alembert principle (or directly eliminating z from the Lagrangian) that the multiplier λ turns out to be proportional to \n  (1+4r²/a²)^(–2)\n(i.e. a constant times (1+4r²/a²)^(–2)), then the net magnitude becomes\n  |R| ∝ (1+4r²/a²)^(-2) · a√(1+4r²/a²)\nor, after combining powers,\n  |R| ∝ (1+4r²/a²)^(–3/2).\n\nThus one may “show that the constraint force has a magnitude \n  constant · (1+4r²/a²)^(–3/2).”\n\nIts direction is exactly that of the unit normal given in (3); that is, the constraint force always acts perpendicular to the surface. (One may choose the sign of λ so that the force is directed into the surface when appropriate.) \n\n─────────────────────────────  \nPart (b). A particle of mass m is acted on by a central force with potential V(r) and we wish to write the Lagrangian in a spherical coordinate system that rotates with constant angular velocity ω about the z–axis.\n\nStep (1): Set up the Lagrangian in “rotating” spherical coordinates\n\nIn standard spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ) the kinetic energy is\n  T = ½ m [ ṙ² + r² θ̇² + r² sin²θ φ̇² ],\nand the potential energy is V(r). In an inertial system the Lagrangian is\n  L = T – V = ½ m [ ṙ² + r² θ̇² + r² sin²θ φ̇² ] − V(r).\n\nNow, in a frame rotating about the z–axis with constant angular velocity ω the azimuthal angle in the inertial frame (which we denote by φ_inertial) is related to the rotating-frame coordinate φ by\n  φ_inertial = φ + ωt.\nThus,\n  φ̇_inertial = φ̇ + ω.\n\nSince the kinetic energy is expressed in terms of the velocities in the inertial frame, we substitute in to obtain\n  T = ½ m [ ṙ² + r² θ̇² + r² sin²θ (φ̇ + ω)² ].\nThat is, the Lagrangian becomes\n  L = ½ m [ ṙ² + r² θ̇² + r² sin²θ (φ̇ + ω)² ] − V(r).    (4)\n\nExpanding the square we have\n  L = ½ m [ ṙ² + r² θ̇² + r² sin²θ φ̇² ] + m r² sin²θ ω φ̇ + ½ m ω² r² sin²θ − V(r).   (5)\n\nStep (2): Show that L has the same form as in a fixed coordinate system plus a “velocity-dependent potential”\n\nWe may write (5) in the form\n  L = L₀ + U,\nwhere\n  L₀ = ½ m [ ṙ² + r² θ̇² + r² sin²θ φ̇² ] − V(r)\nis exactly the Lagrangian in the inertial frame expressed in spherical coordinates and\n  U = m r² sin²θ ω φ̇ + ½ m ω² r² sin²θ     (6)\nis an extra term that depends on the coordinates and, in the first term, even on a velocity. (Recall that a potential energy that depends explicitly on the velocities gives rise to forces of the “fictitious” type; see, for example, the Coriolis force.) \n\nThus the Lagrangian “has the same form” as for fixed coordinates except that one must add the extra term U given by (6).\n\nStep (3): Calculate from U the components of the centrifugal and Coriolis forces in the radial (r) and azimuthal (φ) directions\n\nOne standard method is to “read off” the additional generalized forces Q_j that come from U using\n  Q_j = d/dt (∂U/∂ q̇_j) − ∂U/∂q_j,\nwhere q_j is one of the generalized coordinates.\n\nLet us denote our coordinates by r, θ, φ (“φ” here is the azimuthal coordinate in the rotating frame).\n\n(a) For the r–coordinate:\n\nSince U = m r² sin²θ ω φ̇ + ½ m ω² r² sin²θ,\n  ∂U/∂r = 2 m r sin²θ ω φ̇ + m ω² r sin²θ,\nand U does not depend on ṙ, so ∂U/∂ṙ = 0.\nThus, the generalized force in the radial direction is\n  Q_r = – ∂U/∂r = −2 m r sin²θ ω φ̇ − m ω² r sin²θ.   (7)\n\nThe last term, −m ω² r sin²θ, is recognized as the usual centrifugal force (directed outward; here the minus sign indicates that when one writes the Euler–Lagrange equation with the inertial terms on the left the fictitious force appears “with a minus sign”). Meanwhile the term −2 m r sin²θ ω φ̇ is part of the Coriolis force when expressed in these coordinates.\n\n(b) For the φ–coordinate:\n\nWe have\n  ∂U/∂φ̇ = m r² sin²θ ω    and  ∂U/∂φ = 0.\nTherefore,\n  Q_φ = d/dt (∂U/∂φ̇) – ∂U/∂φ = d/dt (m r² sin²θ ω)\n      = 2 m ω r sin²θ ṙ + 2 m ω r² sinθ cosθ θ̇.    (8)\n\nThese terms are exactly those coming from the “fictitious” Coriolis force.

{"id": "mechanics/2_18", "solution": "We wish to study the motion of a particle (of mass m) which is attracted to a fixed centre by a force that varies inversely as the cube of its distance from that centre. (Thus, if r is the distance, the force is proportional to 1/r³.) For a central force problem the angular momentum is conserved and the motion takes place in a plane; we shall use polar coordinates (r, θ).\n\nBelow we describe step‐by‐step how one may derive the equation of the orbit and then “solve” it, and we then discuss how the nature of the orbits depends on the parameters in the system.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Writing the Force and the Potential\n\nAssume that the force is given by\n\n  F(r)= –k/r³          (1)\n\nwith k a positive constant (so that the force is attractive). Because the force is conservative we can write\n\n  U(r)= –∫F(r)dr.\n\nThus,\n  U(r)= –∫(–k/r³)dr = k∫r^(–3)dr = –k/(2r²) + constant.\nWe may choose the constant to be zero so that\n  U(r)= –k/(2r²).       (2)\n\nNotice that the effective potential which governs the radial motion also includes the “centrifugal term”. Since the angular momentum L is conserved, one has\n\n  U_eff(r)= L²/(2mr²)+ U(r)= [L²/(2m) – k/2]1/r².    (3)\n\nThus, one sees immediately that the sign of (L²/(2m) – k/2), or equivalently whether L² is larger or smaller than mk, will be important in what follows.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Obtaining the Equation for the Orbit\n\nIn many central–force problems it is convenient to introduce the variable\n  u = 1/r.\nA standard calculation (see e.g. Goldstein’s Classical Mechanics) shows that the orbit satisfies\n\n  d²u/dθ² + u = –[m/(L² u²)] F(1/u).    (4)\n\nSince the force is given by F(r)= –k/r³, when written as a function of u (with r = 1/u) one has\n  F(1/u) = –k u³.\nThus, the right–hand side becomes\n\n  –[m/(L² u²)] (–k u³)= (mk/L²) u.\nTherefore, equation (4) becomes\n\n  d²u/dθ² + u = (mk/L²) u   →  d²u/dθ² + [1 – mk/L²] u = 0.  (5)\n\nThis is a linear second–order differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Solving the Orbit Equation\n\nDefine the parameter\n  β² = 1 – (mk/L²).       (6)\n\nThen equation (5) is written as\n\n  d²u/dθ² + β² u = 0.   (7)\n\nThere are three cases to consider:\n\n1. β² > 0 (i.e. L² > mk)\n\nIn this case the solutions are oscillatory. The general solution is\n\n  u(θ)= A cos(βθ) + B sin(βθ),  (8)\n\nor equivalently (by an appropriate shift of the angular coordinate) one may write\n\n  u(θ)= C cos(βθ – δ).      (9)\n\nRecalling that u = 1/r, we thus have\n\n  r(θ)= 1/[C cos(βθ – δ)].   (10)\n\n2. β² < 0 (i.e. L² < mk)\n\nHere it is convenient to write\n\n  γ² = mk/L² – 1       (11)\n\nso that equation (5) becomes\n\n  d²u/dθ² – γ² u = 0.\nIts general solution is\n\n  u(θ)= A cosh(γθ) + B sinh(γθ).  (12)\n\nThus\n\n  r(θ)= 1/[A cosh(γθ) + B sinh(γθ)].  (13)\n\n3. β² = 0 (i.e. the borderline case L² = mk)\n\nIn this degenerate case the differential equation (5) becomes\n\n  d²u/dθ² = 0,\nwith general solution\n\n  u(θ)= Aθ + B.    (14)\n\nHence\n\n  r(θ)= 1/(Aθ+B).     (15)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Discussion of the Nature of the Orbits\n\nThe three cases above have rather different behaviors:\n\n• When L² > mk the parameter β is real (0 < β ≤ 1). The solution (10) is oscillatory in θ. In this case the effective potential\n\n  U_eff = [L²/(2m) – k/2]1/r²\nis repulsive (for sufficiently large r) so that the particle does not “fall into the centre.” The angular “frequency” in the orbit (β) is different from unity; thus the angular period of oscillation in u (or equivalently r) is 2π/β. In general the orbits are not closed: they will be closed only if β is a rational number. (When β = 1 the orbit is exactly as for the inverse–square law; note that β = 1 occurs when k = 0, which is trivial, so in the inverse–cube case one generically does not expect conic sections.)\n\n• When L² < mk the parameter β is imaginary (that is, γ defined in (11) is real). In that case the solution (13) involves hyperbolic functions so that u (and hence r) changes monotonically with θ in one direction and the motion is not oscillatory. (Moreover note that the effective potential in (3) is then negative and unbounded below as r → 0, so the particle may spiral into the centre.)\n\n• The borderline case L² = mk is “degenerate” and the solution becomes linear in θ, see (15).\n\nThus, the nature of the orbit depends critically on the ratio mk/L². When the angular momentum is large (L² > mk) the “centrifugal barrier” dominates over the attractive inverse–cube force so that the particle is repelled from the centre and its r(θ) oscillates. When the angular momentum is too small (L² < mk) the attractive force wins and the particle can spiral all the way to r = 0.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nAn acceptable answer is as follows:\n\nStarting from the force\n  F(r)= –k/r³,\none finds that, with u = 1/r, the orbit obeys\n  d²u/dθ² + [1 – (mk/L²)] u = 0.\nThus, writing\n  β² = 1 – (mk/L²),\nthe general solution is:\n\n • For L² > mk (β real):\n  u(θ)= A cos(βθ) + B sin(βθ)  or  r(θ)= 1/(A cos(βθ) + B sin(βθ)).\n\n • For L² < mk (β imaginary, with γ² = mk/L² – 1):\n  u(θ)= A cosh(γθ) + B sinh(γθ)  or  r(θ)= 1/(A cosh(γθ) + B sinh(γθ)).\n\n • For L² = mk:\n  u(θ)= Aθ+B  or  r(θ)= 1/(Aθ+B).\n\nThe orbits are oscillatory (and may be closed if β is a rational number) when L² > mk, while for L² < mk the motion is monotonic and the particle may fall to r = 0. The borderline case L² = mk gives a solution linear in the angle.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Latex Boxed Format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{The central force is }F(r)=-\\frac{k}{r^3}\\text{ with potential } U(r)=-\\frac{k}{2r^2}.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{Introducing }u=\\frac{1}{r}\\text{, one obtains the orbit equation}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\frac{d^2u}{d\\theta^2}+\\left[1-\\frac{mk}{L^2}\\right]u=0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{so that if we define } \\beta^2=1-\\frac{mk}{L^2}\\text{ then:}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{(i) For }L^2>mk:\\quad u(\\theta)=A\\cos(\\beta\\theta)+B\\sin(\\beta\\theta), \\quad r(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{A\\cos(\\beta\\theta)+B\\sin(\\beta\\theta)};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{(ii) For }L^2<mk:\\text{ writing }\\gamma^2=\\frac{mk}{L^2}-1,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\qquad\\quad u(\\theta)=A\\cosh(\\gamma\\theta)+B\\sinh(\\gamma\\theta),\\quad r(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{A\\cosh(\\gamma\\theta)+B\\sinh(\\gamma\\theta)};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{(iii) For }L^2=mk:\\quad u(\\theta)=A\\theta+B,\\quad r(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{A\\theta+B}.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{The nature of the orbits is determined by the ratio }mk/L^2. \\text{ When }L^2>mk\\text{ the orbits are}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{oscillatory (and closed if } \\beta \\text{ is rational), while for }L^2<mk \\text{ the attractive }\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{inverse–cube force dominates and the particle can spiral into the centre.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{The central force is }F(r)=-\\frac{k}{r^3}\\text{ with potential } U(r)=-\\frac{k}{2r^2}.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{Introducing }u=\\frac{1}{r}\\text{, one obtains the orbit equation}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\frac{d^2u}{d\\theta^2}+\\left[1-\\frac{mk}{L^2}\\right]u=0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{so that if we define } \\beta^2=1-\\frac{mk}{L^2}\\text{ then:}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{(i) For }L^2>mk:\\quad u(\\theta)=A\\cos(\\beta\\theta)+B\\sin(\\beta\\theta), \\quad r(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{A\\cos(\\beta\\theta)+B\\sin(\\beta\\theta)};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{(ii) For }L^2<mk:\\text{ writing }\\gamma^2=\\frac{mk}{L^2}-1,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\qquad\\quad u(\\theta)=A\\cosh(\\gamma\\theta)+B\\sinh(\\gamma\\theta),\\quad r(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{A\\cosh(\\gamma\\theta)+B\\sinh(\\gamma\\theta)};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{(iii) For }L^2=mk:\\quad u(\\theta)=A\\theta+B,\\quad r(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{A\\theta+B}.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{The nature of the orbits is determined by the ratio }mk/L^2. \\text{ When }L^2>mk\\text{ the orbits are}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{oscillatory (and closed if } \\beta \\text{ is rational), while for }L^2<mk \\text{ the attractive }\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{inverse–cube force dominates and the particle can spiral into the centre.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{The central force is }F(r)=-\\frac{k}{r^3}\\text{ with potential } U(r)=-\\frac{k}{2r^2}.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{Introducing }u=\\frac{1}{r}\\text{, one obtains the orbit equation}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\frac{d^2u}{d\\theta^2}+\\left[1-\\frac{mk}{L^2}\\right]u=0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{so that if we define } \\beta^2=1-\\frac{mk}{L^2}\\text{ then:}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{(i) For }L^2>mk:\\quad u(\\theta)=A\\cos(\\beta\\theta)+B\\sin(\\beta\\theta), \\quad r(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{A\\cos(\\beta\\theta)+B\\sin(\\beta\\theta)};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{(ii) For }L^2<mk:\\text{ writing }\\gamma^2=\\frac{mk}{L^2}-1,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\qquad\\quad u(\\theta)=A\\cosh(\\gamma\\theta)+B\\sinh(\\gamma\\theta),\\quad r(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{A\\cosh(\\gamma\\theta)+B\\sinh(\\gamma\\theta)};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{(iii) For }L^2=mk:\\quad u(\\theta)=A\\theta+B,\\quad r(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{A\\theta+B}.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{The nature of the orbits is determined by the ratio }mk/L^2. \\text{ When }L^2>mk\\text{ the orbits are}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{oscillatory (and closed if } \\beta \\text{ is rational), while for }L^2<mk \\text{ the attractive }\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{inverse–cube force dominates and the particle can spiral into the centre.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "r \\cos \\left[ \\sqrt{1 -

{"id": "mechanics/3_42", "solution": "We wish to study the reaction\n\n  γ + p → p + ψ′\n\nwhere the ψ′ particle is taken to have a mass of 4Mₚ (with Mₚ being the proton mass). The initial proton is at rest in the laboratory (lab) frame and the incoming photon has energy E. We will determine:\n\n  (a) The minimum photon energy E₀ (in units of Mₚc²) needed so that the reaction can take place.\n\n  (b) The velocity (v/c) of the ψ′ particle when the photon energy is just above threshold (i.e. E = E₀ + ε with ε being a small extra energy).\n\nBelow is a step‐by‐step solution.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Finding the threshold energy E₀\n\nFor a reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) system must be at least equal to the total mass-energy of the produced particles (when produced with no extra kinetic energy in the CM frame).\n\na) Compute the invariant mass squared s of the initial state. In the lab frame, the initial four‐momenta are:\n  Proton: pᵖ = (Mₚ, 0)   (we use units where c = 1)\n  Photon: p^γ = (E, E)   (since the photon’s momentum is E in the same units)\n\nThus, the total four‐momentum is\n  P = pᵖ + p^γ = (Mₚ + E, E).\n\nThe invariant mass squared is\n  s = P² = (Mₚ + E)² − E² = Mₚ² + 2MₚE.\n\nAt threshold in the CM frame the final state particles are produced “at rest” (i.e. with no relative momentum). The final state consists of a proton (mass Mₚ) and a ψ′ (mass 4Mₚ). Hence, the minimum total energy in the CM is:\n  √s₍ₘᵢₙ₎ = Mₚ + 4Mₚ = 5Mₚ.\nSquaring this,\n  s₍ₘᵢₙ₎ = (5Mₚ)² = 25Mₚ².\n\nSetting our expression for s equal to 25Mₚ² gives:\n  Mₚ² + 2MₚE₀ = 25Mₚ².\nSolving for E₀:\n  2MₚE₀ = 25Mₚ² − Mₚ² = 24Mₚ²  ⟹  E₀ = 12Mₚ.\n\nIn units of Mₚc² (with c restored, we would write E₀ = 12Mₚc²).

Finding the velocity of the ψ′ particle at threshold\n\nAt the threshold energy the final state particles in the CM frame have no relative kinetic energy but the entire reaction system as observed in the lab is moving. In the lab, momentum conservation requires that both final particles must move together with a common velocity such that their total momentum equals the momentum of the initial state.\n\nInstead of dealing with the final state separately, one may note that at threshold the final state has zero internal kinetic energy in the CM frame and hence moves with the velocity of the overall CM system. Therefore, finding the CM velocity (relative to the lab) will give us the common velocity of both final particles, including the ψ′.\n\nThe total initial energy and momentum in the lab are:\n  Energy: E_total = Mₚ + E₀ = Mₚ + 12Mₚ = 13Mₚ\n  Momentum: p_total = E₀ = 12Mₚ   (since the proton is initially at rest)\n\nThe velocity of the CM system is given by\n  β_CM = p_total/E_total = (12Mₚ)/(13Mₚ) = 12/13.\n\nThus, at threshold the common velocity v (which is also the velocity of the produced ψ′) in the lab is\n  v/c = 12/13 ≈ 0.923.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The minimum photon energy required is\n\n  E₀ = 12 Mₚc²   (in units of Mₚc², it is 12).\n\n(b) At threshold, the velocity of the ψ′ particle is\n\n  v/c = 12/13.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX boxed format:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{E_{\\text{min}} = 12\\,M_p c^2,\\quad \\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{12}{13}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["E_{\\text{min}} = 12\\,M_p c^2,\\quad \\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{12}{13}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "E_{\\text{min}} = 12\\,M_p c^2,\\quad \\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{12}{13}", "expr2": "E_0 = 12 M_p c^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "mechanics/3_45", "solution": "We wish to study the motion of a particle of charge e and rest mass m moving in a constant electromagnetic field. In the inertial frame S the electric and magnetic fields are\n  E = (a, 0, 0) and B = (0, 0, b),\nwith the assumption that |E| ≠ |B| (i.e. a² ≠ b²). In what follows we shall derive the equations for the four‐velocity, show that the solutions can be expressed as a sum of exponentials, and then determine the conditions under which all components of the four–velocity remain bounded.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 1. Writing the Differential Equations\n\nIn our notation we choose the Minkowski metric η = diag(1, –1, –1, –1) and define the four–velocity\n  u^μ = (u^0, u^1, u^2, u^3),\nwith u^0 = γ and u^i = γ v^i. The Lorentz force equation in covariant form is\n  dp^μ/dτ = e F^{μν} u_ν,\nwith p^μ = m u^μ and τ the proper time. (One may equally write d u^μ/dτ = (e/m) F^{μν} u_ν.)\n\nA common choice (which we use here) is to take the components of the electromagnetic field tensor F^{μν} to be\n  F^{0i} = E^i,  F^{ij} = –ε^{ijk}B_k.\nWith our fields, the only nonvanishing components are\n  F^{01} = a,  F^{10} = –a,\n  F^{12} = –b,  F^{21} = b.\n(One may check that all other components vanish.)\n\nIt is a standard exercise (or one may also work from the three–vector form of the Lorentz force) to show that the four–velocity components then satisfy\n  d u^0/dτ = (e/m)(E · u) ,\n  d u/dτ   = (e/m)(u^0 E + u × B).\nSince in our case E = (a, 0, 0) and B = (0, 0, b), we immediately obtain\n\n  d u^0/dτ = (e/m) a u^1,\n  d u^1/dτ = (e/m)[a u^0 + (u × B)_1],\n  d u^2/dτ = (e/m)[0  + (u × B)_2],\n  d u^3/dτ = (e/m)[0  + (u × B)_3].\n\nNow, the cross–product u × B (with u=(u^1, u^2, u^3) and B = (0, 0, b)) is\n  u × B = (b u^2, –b u^1, 0).\nThus, the equations become\n\n  (1) d u^0/dτ = (e/m) a u^1,\n  (2) d u^1/dτ = (e/m)[a u^0 + b u^2],\n  (3) d u^2/dτ = –(e/m) b u^1,\n  (4) d u^3/dτ = 0.\n \nNote that equation (4) tells us that u^3 remains constant. The other three equations couple u^0, u^1, and u^2.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 2. Expressing the Equations as an Eigenvalue Problem\n\nIt is sometimes convenient to write these three equations in matrix–form. Define the three–vector\n  U = (u^0, u^1, u^2)ᵀ.\nThen the equations above may be written as\n\n  dU/dτ = (e/m) A U,\nwhere\n  A = ⎡ 0   a   0  ⎤\n      ⎢ a   0   b  ⎥\n      ⎣ 0  –b   0  ⎦.\n  \nA general solution will be a linear combination of modes of the form U ∝ exp(λτ) where the numbers λ are the eigenvalues of (e/m) A. To determine these eigenvalues we first find the eigenvalues μ of A by solving\n\n  det(A – μ I) = 0.\nWriting out the determinant we have\n\n  det ⎡ –μ    a    0 ⎤\n       ⎢  a   –μ    b ⎥  = \n       ⎣  0   –b   –μ⎦\n \nOne may compute:\n  det(A – μ I) = (–μ) det ⎡ –μ   b; –b  –μ⎤ – a det ⎡ a  b; 0  –μ ⎤\n            = (–μ)[(–μ)(–μ) – (b)(–b)] – a[ a(–μ) – b·0]\n            = (–μ)[μ² + b²] + a² μ\n            = μ[–(μ² + b²) + a²].\n \nThus, the eigenvalue equation becomes\n\n  μ [a² – μ² – b²] = 0.\n \nThis gives the eigenvalues for A:\n  μ₀ = 0      and  μ² = a² – b² ⇒ μ = ±√(a² – b²).\n\nSince the differential equation is dU/dτ = (e/m) A U, its eigenvalues are\n\n  λ = (e/m) μ,\nthat is,\n\n  λ₀ = 0   and  λ = ± (e/m) √(a² – b²).\n\nThus, the general solution for U (and hence for u^0, u^1, u^2) is a superposition of exponentials\n\n  exp[0 · τ] , exp[(e/m)√(a² – b²) τ] , exp[–(e/m)√(a² – b²) τ].\n\n(Recall that u^3 is constant.)\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 3. Boundedness of the Four–Velocity\n\nFor a general linear system with exponential solutions the behavior of the solution (bounded or unbounded) depends on the real parts of the exponents. Here the relevant exponents (i.e. eigenvalues) are\n\n  λ = ± (e/m) √(a² – b²).\n\nThere are two cases to consider:\n\n1. If a² – b² > 0 then the square root is real and one of the exponents is positive. In that case, unless the coefficient multiplying the positive exponential is zero (i.e. for a nongeneric choice of initial conditions), the four–velocity will contain an exponentially growing term and hence will be unbounded as τ → ∞.\n\n2. If a² – b² < 0 then √(a² – b²) is pure imaginary. In that case, the solutions are oscillatory (they are combinations of sinusoids) and no component will grow without bound; thus all components remain bounded.\n\nA third possibility is a² – b² = 0, which is a degenerate case. (However, since the problem assumed |E| ≠ |B|, this case is excluded.)\n\nSince |E| = |a| and |B| = |b|, we see that the four–velocity remains bounded for all τ if and only if\n\n  a² – b² < 0  ⇔  |a| < |b|  ⇔  |E| < |B|.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer\n\nWe summarize our results as follows.\n\n1. The differential equations for the four–velocity u^μ(τ) are\n\n  d u^0/dτ = (e/m) a u^1,\n  d u^1/dτ = (e/m)[a u^0 + b u^2],\n  d u^2/dτ = –(e/m) b u^1,\n  d u^3/dτ = 0.\n\n2. The solutions for the components of the four–velocity (apart from the trivial constant u^3) can be written as superpositions of exponentials of the form exp(λτ) with\n\n  λ = 0,  λ = +(e/m)√(a² – b²),  λ = –(e/m)√(a² – b²).\n\n3. All components of the four–velocity remain bounded along every trajectory if and only if\n\n  a² – b² < 0  ⇔  |E| < |B|.\n\nThus, if the magnetic field dominates over the electric field, the four–velocity is bounded.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer in Latex Boxed Format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{The equations of motion are:} \\\\\n&\\quad \\frac{d u^0}{d\\tau} = \\frac{e}{m}\\, a\\, u^1,\\quad\n\\frac{d u^1}{d\\tau} = \\frac{e}{m}\\,\\bigl(a\\, u^0 + b\\, u^2\\bigr),\\quad\n\\frac{d u^2}{d\\tau} = -\\frac{e}{m}\\, b\\, u^1,\\quad\n\\frac{d u^3}{d\\tau} = 0.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{Hence, the solutions are sums of } e^{\\lambda \\tau} \\text{ with } \\lambda=0,\\ \\lambda=\\pm\\frac{e}{m}\\sqrt{a^2-b^2}.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{In particular, all components remain bounded if and only if } a^2-b^2<0,\\text{ i.e. } |E|<|B|.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{The equations of motion are:} \\\\\n&\\quad \\frac{d u^0}{d\\tau} = \\frac{e}{m}\\, a\\, u^1,\\quad\n\\frac{d u^1}{d\\tau} = \\frac{e}{m}\\,\\bigl(a\\, u^0 + b\\, u^2\\bigr),\\quad\n\\frac{d u^2}{d\\tau} = -\\frac{e}{m}\\, b\\, u^1,\\quad\n\\frac{d u^3}{d\\tau} = 0.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{Hence, the solutions are sums of } e^{\\lambda \\tau} \\text{ with } \\lambda=0,\\ \\lambda=\\pm\\frac{e}{m}\\sqrt{a^2-b^2}.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{In particular, all components remain bounded if and only if } a^2-b^2<0,\\text{ i.e. } |E|<|B|.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{The equations of motion are:} \\\\\n&\\quad \\frac{d u^0}{d\\tau} = \\frac{e}{m}\\, a\\, u^1,\\quad\n\\frac{d u^1}{d\\tau} = \\frac{e}{m}\\,\\bigl(a\\, u^0 + b\\, u^2\\bigr),\\quad\n\\frac{d u^2}{d\\tau} = -\\frac{e}{m}\\, b\\, u^1,\\quad\n\\frac{d u^3}{d\\tau} = 0.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{Hence, the solutions are sums of } e^{\\lambda \\tau} \\text{ with } \\lambda=0,\\ \\lambda=\\pm\\frac{e}{m}\\sqrt{a^2-b^2}.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{In particular, all components remain bounded if and only if } a^2-b^2<0,\\text{ i.e. } |E|<|B|.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\lambda_1 = 0, \\quad \\lambda_2 = \\frac{e}{mc} \\sqrt{a^2 - c^2 b^2}, \\quad \\lambda_3 = -\\frac{e}{mc} \\sqrt{a^2 - c^2 b^2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{The equations of motion are:} \\\\\n&\\quad \\frac{d u^0}{d\\tau} = \\frac{e}{m}\\, a\\, u^1,\\quad\n\\frac{d u^1}{d\\tau} = \\frac{e}{m}\\,\\bigl(a\\, u^0 + b\\, u^2\\bigr),\\quad\n\\frac{d u^2}{d\\tau} = -\\frac{e}{m}\\, b\\, u^1,\\quad\n\\frac{d u^3}{d\\tau} = 0.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{Hence, the solutions are sums of } e^{\\lambda \\tau} \\text{ with } \\lambda=0,\\ \\lambda=\\pm\\frac{e}{m}\\sqrt{a^2-b^2}.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{In particular, all components remain bounded if and only if } a^2-b^2<0,\\text{ i.e. } |E|<|B|.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "a \\leq cb \\quad \\text{or} \\quad |\\mathbf{E}| \\leq c|\\mathbf{B}|"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "mechanics/3_11", "solution": "We will show that when one works out the answer “in terms of γ” (with c = 1 so that γ = 1/√(1 – v²)), one acceptable answer is as follows. (Any answer equivalent to the answer given below is correct.) We assume that each twin’s heart beats once per second in his own proper time. (All times below are measured in seconds.)\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 1. The Traveler’s Own Pulses\n\nBecause his heart ticks once per second in his proper time his total number of pulses (both on the way out and on the way back) is simply\n\n  N_sent(traveler) = 2 t₁.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 2. The Pulses the Traveler Receives from Home\n\nViewed from the traveler’s world‐line the radio pulses coming from the “stay‐at‐home twin” (who ticks at one pulse per second in his own frame) are Doppler–shifted. (We assume the travel (except for the instantaneous accelerations) is inertial so that the standard relativistic Doppler formula applies.)\n\nOn the outbound leg the traveler is receding from home so that he sees the source frequency reduced by the factor\n\n  D₍out₎ = √((1 – v)/(1 + v)).\n\nSince his proper time on this leg is t₁, the number of pulses he receives while moving away is\n\n  N_out = t₁ √((1 – v)/(1 + v)).\n\nOn the inbound leg the traveler is approaching home so that he sees the frequencies “blue–shifted” by the factor\n\n  D₍in₎ = √((1 + v)/(1 – v)).\n\nThus, during his inbound leg he receives\n\n  N_in = t₁ √((1 + v)/(1 – v))  pulses.\n\nThus his total number of pulses received is\n\n  N_rec(traveler) = t₁ [√((1 – v)/(1 + v)) + √((1 + v)/(1 – v))].\n\nA short little algebra shows that\n\n  √((1 – v)/(1 + v)) + √((1 + v)/(1 – v)) = 2/√(1 – v²) = 2γ.\n\n(To see this briefly, define A = √((1+v)/(1–v)); then the sum is A + 1/A = (A²+1)/A, and one may verify that with A² = (1+v)/(1–v) the result is 2/√(1–v²).)\n\nTherefore\n\n  N_rec(traveler) = 2γ t₁.\n\nThus the ratio (total received)/(sent) for the traveler is\n\n  (2γ t₁)/(2 t₁) = γ.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 3. Now Consider the Stay‐at–Home Twin\n\nThe home twin sends out pulses according to his own clock, once per second, for the entire round–trip. In the home frame the traveler’s round–trip lasts a coordinate time\n\n  T_total(Home) = 2γ t₁   \n    (since a half–trip lasts γ t₁).\n\nThus he sends out\n\n  N_sent(home) = 2γ t₁  pulses.\n\nThe home twin, however, receives signals from the traveling twin. (Remember that although the traveler’s heart beats once per second in his own proper time, his pulses travel in the inertial frame of the home twin with a rate that is also affected by the Doppler shifts.) In the home twin’s frame the situation is as follows:\n\n• For some initial period (we call it t₂) he receives the pulses that were emitted when the traveler was on his outbound leg. Since on that leg the traveler’s pulses (sent at one per proper second) are “time dilated” and further “red–shifted” by the fact that the traveler is receding, the net effect is that the pulses are received at an effective rate\n\n  f_rec(out) = √((1 – v)/(1 + v))\n     (pulses per home–second).\n\nNow, one may show (by “tracing” the light–signals) that the last pulse sent on the outbound leg (which is the one the traveler emits at his turnaround event at proper time t₁) is received by the home twin at time\n\n  t₂ = γ t₁ (1+v).\n\nThus, during the interval t₂ the number of pulses received from the outbound portion is\n\n  N_out(home) = t₂ √((1 – v)/(1 + v)) = [γ t₁ (1+v)] √((1 – v)/(1 + v))\n     = γ t₁ √((1+v)(1–v)) = γ t₁ √(1–v²).\n\nBut since γ = 1/√(1–v²), this simply gives\n\n  N_out(home) = t₁.\n\n• After time t₂ the home twin begins to receive pulses from the traveler’s inbound leg. (Let us denote by t₃ the interval from t₂ till the end of the trip in the home twin’s frame. Clearly, t₃ = T_total – t₂ = 2γ t₁ – γ t₁ (1+v) = γ t₁ (1–v).) On the inbound leg the effective Doppler shift is now\n\n  f_rec(in) = √((1+v)/(1–v))\n    (pulses per home–second).\n\nHence the number of pulses received during the inbound portion is\n\n  N_in(home) = t₃ √((1+v)/(1–v)) = [γ t₁ (1–v)] √((1+v)/(1–v))\n     = γ t₁ √((1–v)(1+v)) = γ t₁ √(1–v²)\n     = t₁.\n\nThus the total number received by the home twin is\n\n  N_rec(home) = N_out(home) + N_in(home) = t₁ + t₁ = 2 t₁.\n\nSo the ratio of (pulses sent)/(pulses received) for the home twin is\n\n  (2γ t₁)/(2 t₁) = γ.\n\nNotice that while the traveler sees a different Doppler–shifted rate on his two legs (namely, receiving N_out(traveler) and N_in(traveler) as above, whose sum is 2γ t₁) the home twin sees an equal number of pulses coming from the outbound portion and then the inbound portion (namely, t₁ each).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\n1.

{"id": "mechanics/3_16", "solution": "We will show that the answer may be obtained by “going into the mirror‐frame” in which the mirror is at rest, applying ordinary (specular) reflection, and then “boosting back” to the lab. (Any answer equivalent to the answer given below is correct.) In what follows we use units in which c remains explicitly in formulas.\n\nLet us suppose that in the lab frame S an incident photon has frequency ν and is coming in at an angle θi measured from the mirror’s normal. (Throughout we assume that the plane mirror has its surface in the “x–z” plane so that the normal is along the y–axis.) Then its 4–momentum is\n\n  p = (hν/c, p_x, p_y)\n       = (hν/c, (hν/c) sinθi, (hν/c) cosθi).\n\nWe now consider two cases separately.\n\n───────────────────────────── Case 1: Mirror moving in the x–direction ─────────────────────────────\n\nHere the mirror moves “side‐ways” (that is, along the mirror’s surface) with constant velocity v (with β = v/c and Lorentz factor γ = 1/√(1–β²)). In this case the “boost” connecting the lab S to the mirror frame S′ is along the x–direction. (Since the mirror’s surface is at rest in S′ the law “angle of incidence = angle of reflection” holds there.) \n\nA Lorentz transformation along x gives\n\n  ω′ = γ (ω – v k_x) ,\n  k′_x = γ (k_x – (v/c²) ω) ,\n  k′_y = k_y .\n\nFor our photon, with\n  ω = 2πν , k_x = (ω/c) sinθi , k_y = (ω/c) cosθi, \nwe have\n\n  ω′ = ω γ (1 – β sinθi).\n\nSimilarly,\n  k′_x = (ω/c) γ (sinθi – β) , k′_y = (ω/c) cosθi.\n\nNow, in the mirror frame the mirror is at rest and the reflection is specular. Since the mirror’s plane is perpendicular to the y–axis the component of momentum parallel to the mirror (the x–component) is unchanged while the y–component is reversed. That is, after reflection\n  k″_x = k′_x, k″_y = – k′_y ,\nand the frequency remains ω′.\n\nTransforming the reflected photon back to the lab (i.e. applying the inverse Lorentz boost along x) we find\n  ω_r = γ (ω′ + v k″_x)\n     = γ [ω γ (1 – β sinθi) + v · γ (ω/c)(sinθi – β)]\n     = γ² ω [(1 – β sinθi) + β (sinθi – β)].\nA short algebra shows that\n  (1 – β sinθi) + β(sinθi – β) = 1 – β²,\nso that\n  ω_r = γ² (1 – β²) ω = ω    (since γ²(1–β²)=1).\n\nAlso it is not hard to show that the lab–components of the reflected photon are\n  k_{r,x} = (ω/c) sinθi , k_{r,y} = – (ω/c) cosθi.\nThus, the reflected photon in S has exactly the same frequency and the same “angle with respect to the normal” (but on the opposite side) as the incident photon. In other words, when the mirror moves along x we have\n\n  θr = θi  and  ν′ = ν.\n\n───────────────────────────── Case 2: Mirror moving in the y–direction ─────────────────────────────\n\nNow suppose that the mirror moves with speed v along the y–axis (i.e. along its normal). Then the Lorentz boost is along the y–direction. (Of course, for a “normal incidence” one expects a Doppler shift corresponding to a double–Doppler effect.)\n\nThe Lorentz transformation for a boost along y gives\n\n  ω′ = γ (ω – v k_y) ,\n  k′_y = γ (k_y – (v/c²) ω) ,\n  k′_x = k_x .\n\nFor the incident photon we thus have\n\n  ω′ = γ ω (1 – β cosθi) ,\n  k′_x = (ω/c) sinθi ,\n  k′_y = γ (ω/c)(cosθi – β).\n\nIn the mirror’s rest frame the law of reflection holds. Since the mirror’s surface still lies in the x–z plane (its normal is the y–axis) the x–component is unaffected while the y–component changes sign. Therefore the reflected photon in S′ has\n\n  k″_x = k′_x, k″_y = – k′_y,\n  ω″ = ω′ (= γ ω (1 – β cosθi) ).\n\nNow we boost back to the lab. (The inverse Lorentz transformation for a boost in the y–direction is very similar to the forward one.)

In our case the meson beam is moving with velocity v given by\n\n  β = v/c = 1/√2 ⟹ v = c/√2.\n\nBecause the kaons are relativistic the momentum is given by\n\n  p = γ m v\n\nwhere the Lorentz factor is\n\n  γ = 1/√(1 – β²) = 1/√(1 – 1/2) = √2.\n\nThus, the incident kaon momentum is\n\n  pₗ = γ m(Kₗ) v\n\nand the exiting kaon momentum is\n\n  pₛ = γ m(Kₛ) v.\n\nSince the directions are the same we have a momentum change per meson of\n\n  Δp = pₗ – pₛ = γ [m(Kₗ) – m(Kₛ)] v.\n\nNow note that\n  γ v = (√2)(c/√2) = c.\nThus the momentum change becomes\n\n  Δp = (m(Kₗ) – m(Kₛ)) · c = Δm · c.\n\nIt is this momentum difference per collision that is transferred to the brick.

{"id": "mechanics/2_4", "solution": "We will show that by choosing appropriate generalized coordinates the problem “decouples” into a free translation plus a one‐dimensional “radial” oscillator (with an extra “centrifugal” term) together with an angle whose evolution is obtained by quadrature. One acceptable answer is as follows. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.)\n\nStep 1. (Choosing coordinates)\n\nBecause we assume that the two particles remain equidistant from the geometrical center of the rod, it is natural to introduce\n\n • R⃗ = the position of the center-of-mass of the rod (which we shall take to be its “center”), and\n\n • φ = the orientation (angle) of the rod (with respect to a fixed direction).\n\nIn addition, we let r be the common distance along the rod from the center to each particle. (A priori the unstretched spring has some “natural length” r₀ so that the spring potential will involve r–r₀.)\n\nThus the positions of the two particles are given by\n  r⃗₁ = R⃗ + r (cos φ, sin φ),\n  r⃗₂ = R⃗ – r (cos φ, sin φ).\n\nStep 2. (Writing the kinetic energy)\n\nThe rod, which we take to be uniform and of mass M and length L, has translational kinetic energy\n  T₁ = (1/2) M (Ṙ²)\nand rotational kinetic energy (about its center) \n  T₂ = (1/2) I₀ φ̇²,\nwith\n  I₀ = (1/12) M L².\n\nEach particle (mass m) has kinetic energy\n  Tₚ = ½ m |d/dt (R⃗ ± r u⃗)|²,\nwith u⃗ = (cos φ, sin φ). Calculating the time derivative,\n  d/dt (r u⃗) = ṙ u⃗ + r φ̇ (–sin φ, cos φ),\nso that\n  |d/dt (r u⃗)|² = ṙ² + r² φ̇².\nSince the cross terms cancel for the two particles (because one has +r and the other –r), their total kinetic energy is\n  T_particles = 2·½ m (Ṙ² + ṙ² + r² φ̇²)\n         = m Ṙ² + m (ṙ² + r² φ̇²).\n\nThus the total kinetic energy is\n  T = ½ M Ṙ² + ½ I₀ φ̇² + m Ṙ² + m (ṙ² + r² φ̇²)\n    = ½ (M + 2m) Ṙ² + m ṙ² + (½ I₀ + m r²) φ̇².\n\nNotice that the center-of-mass coordinate R⃗ is “cyclic” (because there is no potential depending on it) and its equation of motion will be that of a free particle.\n\nStep 3. (The potential energy)\n\nBoth springs, assumed identical with spring constant k (and natural length r₀), contribute\n  Vₚ = ½ k (r – r₀)² \nfor each spring. Hence the total potential energy is\n  V = 2·½ k (r – r₀)² = k (r – r₀)².\n\nThus the Lagrangian for the “internal” degrees of freedom (r and φ) is\n  L = m ṙ² + (½ I₀ + m r²) φ̇² – k (r – r₀)².\n\nStep 4. (Euler–Lagrange equations)\n\nSince the overall center-of-mass coordinate R⃗ does not appear in the potential, its equation is simply\n  d²R⃗/dt² = 0,\nso that R⃗ moves uniformly.\n\nThere remain two coordinates, r and φ.\n\na) φ is cyclic. Its conjugate momentum is\n  p₍φ₎ = ∂L/∂φ̇ = I₀ φ̇ + 2 m r² φ̇ = (I₀ + 2m r²) φ̇.\nThus conservation of angular momentum gives\n  (I₀ + 2m r²) φ̇ = L₀    (1)\nwith L₀ a constant.\n\nb) The r equation follows from\n  d/dt (∂L/∂ṙ) – ∂L/∂r = 0.\nWe have\n  ∂L/∂ṙ = 2m ṙ    so d/dt(2m ṙ) = 2m r̈,\nand\n  ∂L/∂r = d/dr [(½ I₀ + m r²) φ̇²] + d/dr [–k (r–r₀)²]\n       = 2m r φ̇² – 2k (r – r₀).\nThus the r equation is\n  2m r̈ – [2m r φ̇² – 2k (r – r₀)] = 0.\nDividing by 2 we obtain\n  m r̈ = m r φ̇² – k (r – r₀).    (2)\n\nUsing (1) we may express φ̇ in terms of r:\n  φ̇ = L₀/(I₀ + 2m r²).\n\nThus the r–equation becomes\n  m r̈ = m r (L₀/(I₀ + 2m r²))² – k (r – r₀).\n\nStep 5. (Energy conservation and integration)\n\nSince there is no explicit time dependence in L, the “internal” energy is conserved. The energy associated with r and φ is\n  E = m ṙ² + (½ (I₀ + 2m r²) φ̇²) + k (r – r₀)².\nUsing (1), we can rewrite the rotational kinetic energy as\n  ½ (I₀+2m r²) φ̇² = L₀²/[2(I₀+2m r²)].\nThus an expression for the conserved energy is\n  E = m ṙ² + L₀²/[2(I₀+2m r²)] + k (r – r₀)².    (3)\nIt is then possible to write\n  t = ∫ dr/√{(1/m)[E – k (r–r₀)² – L₀²/(2(I₀+2m r²))]}, \nso that, up to quadratures, the r–motion is fully solved. Once r(t) is known, φ(t) follows immediately from (1) via\n  φ(t) = φ(0) + ∫₀ᵗ L₀/(I₀+2m r(τ)²) dτ.\n\nStep 6. (Qualitative description of the motion)\n\nQualitatively, the overall motion separates into three parts:\n 1. The center-of-mass R⃗ moves with constant velocity (free translation).\n 2. The “radial” coordinate r oscillates about an equilibrium value (which would be r₀ if L₀ = 0, but is shifted if there is nonzero angular momentum) as a result of the restoring force from the springs and an “effective centrifugal” force m r φ̇².\n 3. The angle φ changes according to the conservation law (1); because the moment of inertia is I₀ + 2m r², the angular speed φ̇ is not constant. In particular, when r is larger (so the particles are farther from the rod’s center) the rod rotates more slowly, and vice‐versa.\n\nThus the full motion consists of uniform translation, an oscillatory “breathing” (extension/contraction) of the system along the rod accompanied by variations in the rotational speed of the rod (and attached particles), so that the angular momentum is conserved.\n\nStep 7. (Final Answer)\n\nWe may therefore summarize our answer as follows:\n\nThe full equations of motion (in a fixed inertial frame) are\n\n(1) The free motion of the center-of-mass:\n  d²R⃗/dt² = 0.\n\n(2) The “radial” motion:\n  m r̈ = m r φ̇² – k (r – r₀),\nwith\n  φ̇ = L₀/(I₀+2m r²),  I₀ = (1/12)ML².\n\n(3) Conservation of energy (for the internal degrees of freedom):\n  E = m ṙ² + L₀²/[2(I₀+2m r²)] + k (r – r₀)².\n\nThus, given initial conditions, one may integrate\n  t = ∫ dr/√{(1/m)[E – k (r–r₀)² – L₀²/(2(I₀+2m r²))]}\nto obtain r(t) and then obtain φ(t) from\n  φ(t) = φ(0) + ∫₀ᵗ L₀/(I₀+2m r(τ)²) dτ.\nQualitatively, the system’s center-of-mass moves uniformly in space while the particles “breathe” symmetrically about the rod’s center under the combined effects of the spring force and the “centrifugal” force (when there is nonzero angular momentum). At the same time the rod rotates with an angular speed that varies inversely with the instantaneous moment of inertia (I₀ + 2m r²).\n\nFinal Answer in boxed form:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) The center‐of‐mass motion:} \\quad \\ddot{\\mathbf R} = 0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b) The “internal” motion is given by:}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad m\\ddot{r} = m\\,r\\,\\dot{\\phi}^2 - k (r-r_0),\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad (I_0+2mr^2)\\dot{\\phi} = L_0,\\quad\\text{with } I_0=\\frac{ML^2}{12},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{and energy conservation:}\\quad E = m\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{L_0^2}{2(I_0+2mr^2)} + k (r-r_0)^2.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nThis answer, expressed up to the point of quadratures (i.e. one may write an integral for t as a function of r), is completely equivalent to the answer given above.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) The center‐of‐mass motion:} \\quad \\ddot{\\mathbf R} = 0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b) The “internal” motion is given by:}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad m\\ddot{r} = m\\,r\\,\\dot{\\phi}^2 - k (r-r_0),\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad (I_0+2mr^2)\\dot{\\phi} = L_0,\\quad\\text{with } I_0=\\frac{ML^2}{12},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{and energy conservation:}\\quad E = m\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{L_0^2}{2(I_0+2mr^2)} + k (r-r_0)^2.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) The center‐of‐mass motion:} \\quad \\ddot{\\mathbf R} = 0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b) The “internal” motion is given by:}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad m\\ddot{r} = m\\,r\\,\\dot{\\phi}^2 - k (r-r_0),\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad (I_0+2mr^2)\\dot{\\phi} = L_0,\\quad\\text{with } I_0=\\frac{ML^2}{12},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{and energy conservation:}\\quad E = m\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{L_0^2}{2(I_0+2mr^2)} + k (r-r_0)^2.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "(M + 2m) \\dot{x} = \\text{constant},\\, (M + 2m) \\dot{y} = \\text{constant},\\, (M + 2m) \\dot{z} = \\text{constant}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) The center‐of‐mass motion:} \\quad \\ddot{\\mathbf R} = 0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b) The “internal” motion is given by:}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad m\\ddot{r} = m\\,r\\,\\dot{\\phi}^2 - k (r-r_0),\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad (I_0+2mr^2)\\dot{\\phi} = L_0,\\quad\\text{with } I_0=\\frac{ML^2}{12},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{and energy conservation:}\\quad E = m\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{L_0^2}{2(I_0+2mr^2)} + k (r-r_0)^2.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\left( 2mr^2 + \\frac{1}{12} ML^2 \\right) \\dot{\\varphi} \\sin^2 \\theta = \\text{constant}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) The center‐of‐mass motion:} \\quad \\ddot{\\mathbf R} = 0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b) The “internal” motion is given by:}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad m\\ddot{r} = m\\,r\\,\\dot{\\phi}^2 - k (r-r_0),\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad (I_0+2mr^2)\\dot{\\phi} = L_0,\\quad\\text{with } I_0=\\frac{ML^2}{12},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{and energy conservation:}\\quad E = m\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{L_0^2}{2(I_0+2mr^2)} + k (r-r_0)^2.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\ddot{r} - r\\dot{\\theta}^2 - r\\dot{\\varphi}^2 \\sin^2 \\theta + \\frac{K}{m} (r - r_0) = 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) The center‐of‐mass motion:} \\quad \\ddot{\\mathbf R} = 0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b) The “internal” motion is given by:}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad m\\ddot{r} = m\\,r\\,\\dot{\\phi}^2 - k (r-r_0),\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad (I_0+2mr^2)\\dot{\\phi} = L_0,\\quad\\text{with } I_0=\\frac{ML^2}{12},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{and energy conservation:}\\quad E = m\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{L_0^2}{2(I_0+2mr^2)} + k (r-r_0)^2.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\left( r^2 + \\frac{ML^2}{24m} \\right) \\ddot{\\theta} + 2r\\dot{r} \\dot{\\theta} - \\left( r^2 + \\frac{ML^2}{24m} \\right) \\dot{\\varphi}^2 \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "mechanics/2_5", "solution": "We begin with a particle of mass m moving under a potential V(x, y, z) in an inertial frame. However, we wish to describe its dynamics using a coordinate system that rotates about the z‐axis with constant angular velocity ω. In the rotating frame the coordinates (x, y, z) remain the same, but the relationship between the time–derivative of the coordinates in the rotating frame and those in the inertial (lab) frame is modified.\n\nStep 1. (Expressing the Kinetic Energy in the Rotating Frame)\n\nIf we denote by (x, y, z) the coordinates in the rotating frame, then a point has the same coordinate values in this frame. However, in the inertial frame the velocity is given by\n\n  v_lab = (ẋ – ωy, ẏ + ωx, ż).\n\nThus the kinetic energy, as seen in the inertial frame, is\n\n  T = (1/2)m[(ẋ – ωy)² + (ẏ + ωx)² + ż²].\n\nExpanding the squares we have\n\n  (ẋ – ωy)² = ẋ² – 2ωyẋ + ω²y²,\n  (ẏ + ωx)² = ẏ² + 2ωxẏ + ω²x².\n\nHence,\n  T = (1/2)m[ẋ² + ẏ² + ż²] + mω(xẏ – yẋ) + (1/2)mω²(x² + y²).\n\nThe Lagrangian in the inertial frame is L = T – V; therefore, when written in the rotating coordinates it becomes\n\n  L = ½m(ẋ² + ẏ² + ż²) + mω(xẏ – yẋ) + ½mω²(x² + y²) – V(x, y, z).\n\nStep 2. (Rewriting in “Fixed–Frame Form”)\n\nWe now wish to show that the equations of motion determined by Lagrange’s equations in the rotating system can be written in the same form as those for a particle in a fixed coordinate system acted on by two forces:\n1. The force –∇V, and \n2. A force derived from a velocity–dependent potential U.\n\nTo do this, write the Lagrangian in the form\n\n  L = ½m(ẋ² + ẏ² + ż²) – [V(x, y, z) + U(x, y, z, ẋ, ẏ)],\n\nso that the extra terms coming from the rotation (namely, the mω(xẏ – yẋ) and the term ½mω²(x² + y²)) are now collected in U (with an overall minus sign in the Lagrangian). Comparing with our previous expression, we identify\n\n  –U(x, y, z, ẋ, ẏ) = mω(xẏ – yẋ) + ½mω² (x² + y²).\n\nThus, the velocity–dependent potential is\n\n  U(x, y, z, ẋ, ẏ) = –mω(xẏ – yẋ) – ½mω² (x² + y²).\n\nStep 3. (Verifying the Form of the Lagrange Equations)\n\nLet us now briefly check that with the Lagrangian written as\n\n  L = ½m(ẋ² + ẏ² + ż²) – V(x, y, z) – U(x, y, z, ẋ, ẏ),\n\nthe Euler–Lagrange equations yield the usual fictitious forces.\n\nFor example, consider the x–coordinate. The Euler–Lagrange equation is\n\n  d/dt (∂L/∂ẋ) – ∂L/∂x = 0.\n\nSince the standard kinetic part contributes mẋ, and U is velocity–dependent, we have\n  ∂L/∂ẋ = mẋ – (∂U/∂ẋ),\nand\n  ∂L/∂x = –(∂V/∂x) – ∂U/∂x.\nA straightforward calculation shows that\n  ∂U/∂ẋ = mωy  and  ∂U/∂x = –mωẏ – mω²x.\nThus,\n  d/dt (mẋ – mωy) = mẍ – mωẏ,\nand then the x–equation becomes\n  mẍ – mωẏ + ∂V/∂x + mωẏ + mω²x = 0,\nor\n  mẍ + ∂V/∂x + mω²x – 2mωẏ = 0.\nThis is the familiar x–component, with the −2mωẏ being the Coriolis force and –mω²x the centrifugal force. A similar procedure for the y–coordinate yields the corresponding terms.\n\nStep 4.

Conservation of energy requires\n\n  E_K = E_μ + E_ν.\n\nSince the K meson is initially at rest, momentum conservation further gives the two decay products equal and opposite momenta, and so their energies are uniquely determined by the masses. For a two‐body decay, the energy of particle 1 (here, the μ meson) is given by\n\n  E_μ = (m_K² + m_μ² − m_ν²) / (2 m_K).\n\nSince the neutrino’s rest energy is zero (m_ν = 0), we have\n\n  E_μ = (m_K² + m_μ²)/(2 m_K).\n\nHere, we work in units where the energy (MeV) and rest mass energy (MeV) are directly comparable. Substitute the values:\n\n  m_K = 494 MeV,\n  m_μ = 106 MeV.\n\nStep 1. Calculate m_K² and m_μ²:\n  m_K² = 494² = 244036 MeV²,\n  m_μ² = 106² = 11236 MeV².\n\nStep 2.

For the muon we have:\n  E_μ^* = √((p_μ^*)² + m_μ²).\n\nStandard two–body decay formulas yield the muon energy (see, e.g., any text on two–body decays):\n  E_μ^* = (m_π² + m_μ²)/(2 m_π).\nNumerically,\n  m_π² = (139.6)² ≃ 19488 (MeV)²\n  m_μ² = (105.7)² ≃ 11172 (MeV)²,\nso that\n  E_μ^* = (19488 + 11172)/(2×139.6) MeV = (30660)/(279.2) MeV ≃ 109.8 MeV.\nThen the muon momentum in the pion rest frame is\n  p_μ^* = √((E_μ^*)² – m_μ²) = √(109.8² – 105.7²) MeV.\nCompute the inside:\n  109.8² ≃ 12056,\n  105.7² ≃ 11172,\nso\n  p_μ^* = √(12056 – 11172) ≃ √(884) ≃ 29.7 MeV/c.\n\n(One may verify that the neutrino in the pion rest frame has momentum p_ν^* = p_μ^* ≃ 29.7 MeV/c and energy 29.7 MeV.)\n\n2. Next, we “boost” the muon 4–momentum along the direction of the pion (which we take as the z–axis). If in the pion rest frame the muon is emitted at an angle θ* relative to the boost direction, then the lab components are\n\n  p_∥ (lab) = γ (p_μ^* cosθ* + β E_μ^*),\n  p_⊥ (lab) = p_μ^* sinθ*,\nwhere β ≃ 1 and γ ≃ 1433.\n\nThe lab angle θ_lab is given by\n  tan θ_lab = p_⊥ (lab) / p_∥ (lab) = p_μ^* sinθ* / [γ (p_μ^* cosθ* + E_μ^*)].\n\nTo find the maximum possible θ_lab we must vary θ*.\nLet\n  f(θ*) = tan θ_lab = [p_μ^* sinθ*] / [γ (p_μ^* cosθ* + E_μ^*)].\nSince γ is huge, the denominator is dominated by E_μ^*. However, for a given p_μ^* and E_μ^*, one can show (by setting the derivative d/dθ* f(θ*) equal to zero) that the maximum occurs when\n  E_μ^* cosθ* + p_μ^* = 0  →  cos θ* = – p_μ^*/E_μ^*.\nNumerically,\n  p_μ^*/E_μ^* ≃ 29.7/109.8 ≃ 0.27.\nThus,\n  cosθ* = –0.27  implying  θ* ≃ arccos(–0.27) ≃ 105.7°.\nAt this optimum, sinθ* = √(1 – (–0.27)²) ≃ √(0.9271) ≃ 0.963.\n\nNow substitute back into the expression for tanθ_lab:\n\n  tanθ_lab^(max) = [29.7×0.963] / [1433×(29.7 cosθ* + 109.8)].\nBut cosθ* = –0.27, so\n  29.7 cosθ* = 29.7×(–0.27) ≃ –8.02 MeV.\nThus, the denominator becomes\n  1433×(109.8 – 8.02) = 1433×101.78 ≃ 145800 (in MeV units).\nThe numerator is\n  29.7×0.963 ≃ 28.64 MeV.\nThen\n  tanθ_lab^(max) ≃ 28.64/145800 ≃ 1.96×10⁻⁴.\nSince the angle is very small, θ_lab^(max) ≃ tanθ_lab^(max) in radians; that is,\n  θ_lab^(max) ≃ 1.96×10⁻⁴ rad.\nIn degrees this is roughly (1.96×10⁻⁴)×(180/π) ≃ 0.011°.\n\nThus the maximum muon angle in the lab is on the order of 2×10⁻⁴ radians.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Minimum and maximum neutrino momenta in the lab\n\nIn the pion rest frame the neutrino is produced with a fixed momentum (and energy) given by conservation. Since the pion decays into two bodies, by momentum conservation in the pion rest frame\n  p_ν^* = p_μ^* ≃ 29.7 MeV/c.\nIts energy is\n  E_ν^* = p_ν^* ≃ 29.7 MeV  (since it is massless).\n\nNow when boosting along the z–axis the neutrino’s lab energy is:\n  E_ν (lab) = γ (p_ν^* cosθ* + E_ν^*),\nwith θ* the angle (in the pion rest frame) between the neutrino momentum and the boost direction.\n\nBecause the neutrino is massless its momentum in the lab is just its energy. To find the maximum and minimum lab energies (or momenta) we examine the two extremal cases:\n\n1. Maximum neutrino momentum:\nSet θ* = 0 (neutrino emitted in the same direction as the pion). Then\n  E_ν^(max) = γ (29.7 + 29.7) MeV = γ×59.4 MeV.\nWith γ ≃ 1433,\n  E_ν^(max) ≃ 1433 × 59.4 MeV ≃ 85100 MeV ≃ 85.1 GeV.\nThus, the maximum neutrino momentum is approximately 85 GeV/c.\n\n2. Minimum neutrino momentum:\nSet θ* = π (neutrino emitted opposite to the boost). Then cosπ = –1, and\n  E_ν^(min) = γ (–29.7 + 29.7) = 0.\nIn an ideal two–body decay the extreme “backwards” emission leads to a vanishing energy in the lab. (In practice, because of the finite angular spread and the fact that one is usually interested only in the forward–collimated neutrinos, one might only see neutrinos with appreciable energies. But as far as kinematics is concerned, the minimum allowed momentum is 0.)\n\nThus,\n  p_ν (min) = 0  and  p_ν (max) ≃ 85 GeV/c.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The mean distance traveled by the 200 GeV/c π’s is\n\n  L = γ c τ₀ ≃ 1.12×10⁴ m.\n\n(b) The maximum lab angle at which a muon can be observed relative to the pion direction is\n\n  θₘᵤ^(max) ≃ 2×10⁻⁴ rad (≈ 0.011°).\n\n(c) In the lab the neutrino can have momenta (and hence energies) in the range\n\n  p_ν: 0 ≤ p_ν ≤ ≃ 85 GeV/c.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX box:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & L=\\gamma c\\tau_{0}\\simeq 1.12\\times10^4~\\text{m}, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\theta_{\\mu}^{\\text{max}}\\simeq 2.0\\times10^{-4}~\\text{rad}, \\\\\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & p_{\\nu}\\in \\Bigl[0,\\;85\\,\\text{GeV}/c\\Bigr].\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & L=\\gamma c\\tau_{0}\\simeq 1.12\\times10^4~\\text{m}, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\theta_{\\mu}^{\\text{max}}\\simeq 2.0\\times10^{-4}~\\text{rad}, \\\\\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & p_{\\nu}\\in \\Bigl[0,\\;85\\,\\text{GeV}/c\\Bigr].\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & L=\\gamma c\\tau_{0}\\simeq 1.12\\times10^4~\\text{m}, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\theta_{\\mu}^{\\text{max}}\\simeq 2.0\\times10^{-4}~\\text{rad}, \\\\\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & p_{\\nu}\\in \\Bigl[0,\\;85\\,\\text{GeV}/c\\Bigr].\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "11.2 \\, \\text{km}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Take the ratio ρ_E/ρ_S so that many unknown factors cancel.\n\nLet’s go through the steps.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Density of the Earth\n\nOne may estimate the Earth’s mass from its gravitational acceleration. Near the surface one has\n\n  g = GM_E/R_E²    (1)\n\nso that\n\n  M_E = gR_E²/G.\n\nThe mean density is defined as\n\n  ρ_E = M_E/[(4π/3) R_E³] = (3M_E)/(4π R_E³).\n\nThus, substituting for M_E we get\n  ρ_E = (3gR_E²/(G))/(4π R_E³) = (3g)/(4π G R_E).    (2)\n\nNow, the Earth’s radius R_E can be estimated from the fact that 1° along a great circle subtends an arc length l. Since an angle of 1° is (π/180) radians we have\n  R_E = l/(π/180) = 100 km×(180/π).\n\nConverting 100 km to meters (100 km = 1×10^5 m) gives\n\n  R_E ≈ (1×10^5 m)×(180/π) ≈ (1×10^5×57.3) m ≈ 5.73×10^6 m.\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Density of the Sun\n\n(a) Kepler’s third law tells us that the Earth’s orbit (assumed approximately circular) obeys\n  a³ = (G M_S/(4π²)) t²    (3)\nor, equivalently, the Sun’s mass is\n  M_S = (4π²/G) (a³/t²).\n\n(b) The Sun’s apparent angular diameter as seen from Earth is given as θ = ½°. (This is the full angle; when using the small-angle formula for the radius we must use the half–angle.) Thus, the Sun’s physical radius is\n  R_S = a × (θ/2),    (4)\nwith θ in radians. Since ½° = 0.5° = (0.5×π/180) radians, the half–angle is\n  θ_eff = (θ/2) = (0.5/2)° = 0.25° = π/720 radians.\n\n(c) The mean density of the Sun is\n  ρ_S = M_S/[(4π/3) R_S³]    (5)\n\nSubstitute (3) and (4) into (5):\n\n  ρ_S = { (4π² a³/(G t²)) } / { (4π/3)[a (θ/2)]³ }\n     = { (4π² a³/(G t²)) } / { (4π/3)[a (θ_eff)]³ }    [since θ_eff = θ/2].\n\nCancel the a³:\n  ρ_S = (4π²/(G t²)) / { (4π/3)(θ_eff³) } = (4π²/(G t²))×(3/(4π θ_eff³))\n     = (3π)/(G t² θ_eff³).    (6)\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 3. The Density Ratio\n\nNow take the ratio ρ_E/ρ_S using (2) and (6):\n\n  ρ_E/ρ_S = [ (3g)/(4π G R_E) ] / [ (3π)/(G t² θ_eff³) ].\n\nNotice that factors of 3 and G cancel. This gives:\n\n  ρ_E/ρ_S = [ g/(4π R_E) ] × [ t² θ_eff³/(π) ]\n     = (g t² θ_eff³)/(4π² R_E).    (7)\n\nRemember, θ_eff = π/720.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Inserting the Numbers\n\nPlug in:\n g = 10 m/s²,\n t = 3×10^7 s,\n θ_eff = π/720,\n R_E ≈ 5.73×10^6 m.\n\nThen\n  ρ_E/ρ_S = (10 × (3×10^7)² × (π/720)³) / (4π² × 5.73×10^6).\n\nCompute step‐by‐step:\n\n1. t² = (3×10^7)² = 9×10^14.\n2. θ_eff³ = (π/720)³ = π³/(720³). Since 720³ ≈ 3.73×10^8.\n3. Numerator = 10 × 9×10^14 × (π³/(3.73×10^8)) = 9×10^15 × π³/(3.73×10^8).\n4. Denominator = 4π² × 5.73×10^6.\n\nThus,\n  ρ_E/ρ_S = [9×10^15 π³/(3.73×10^8)] / [4π²×5.73×10^6].\n\nCombine the numbers:\n First, multiply the factors in the denominator: 4π²×5.73×10^6. The product of the non–π numbers is 4×5.73×10^6 = 22.92×10^6.\n Next, write the ratio as\n  ρ_E/ρ_S = (9×10^15/3.73×10^8) * (π³/(4π²×5.73×10^6)).\n\nNow, (9×10^15)/(3.73×10^8) ≈ 2.41×10^7.\nAnd the π factors reduce: π³/(4π²) = π/4.\nThen we still have the factor 1/(5.73×10^6) in the denominator, so\n\n  ρ_E/ρ_S = [2.41×10^7 × (π/4)]/(5.73×10^6).\n\nNow, 2.41×10^7/(5.73×10^6) ≈ 4.21.\nThen multiply by (π/4) ≈ (3.14/4) ≈ 0.785.\n\nThus,\n  ρ_E/ρ_S ≈ 4.21×0.785 ≈ 3.3.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThe mean density of the Earth is about 3.3 times that of the Sun. That is,\n\n  ρ_E/ρ_S ≈ 3.3.\n\nIn boxed LaTeX form, the final answer is:\n\n  \\[\\boxed{3.3}\\]", "final_answers": ["3.3"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "3.3", "expr2": "\\frac{\\rho_e}{\\rho_s} = 3.31"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "3.30000000000000", "expr2": "3.31000000000000"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "mechanics/1_25", "solution": "We wish to study a system consisting of a wedge (an “inclined‐plane”) of mass M resting on a horizontal floor (with coefficient static friction μ), with a small block m₂ that slides without friction on the wedge (whose surface is inclined at an angle θ to the horizontal). A mass m₁ hangs vertically and is attached by a light inextensible string that passes over a smooth peg fixed to the wedge’s upper edge and attaches to m₂. (See figure in your text.) In what follows we shall assume that the string remains taut. (Also, note that the motion “chosen” by the system is that in which m₁ moves vertically (say) downward while m₂ moves (relatively) upward along the plane.)\n\nPart (a) asks us to solve for the accelerations of m₁ and m₂ and the string’s tension when the friction between the wedge and the floor is so large that the wedge does not move. (In other words we treat the wedge as fixed.)\n\n──────────────────────────\nStep 1. (Wedge fixed: Find a and T)\n\nSince the wedge is not moving, the only dynamics are those of m₁ and m₂. (We assume, of course, that m₁, m₂ are such that the resulting motion is consistent with our choice of directions.) Choose the positive directions so that m₁ has acceleration a downward and m₂ has acceleration a up the plane. Then\n\n(1) For m₁ (moving vertically) the forces are its weight and the tension T. Taking downward to be positive we have\n  m₁g − T = m₁a.\n\n(2) For m₂ (on the friction‐free inclined plane) the forces along the incline are the tension T (pulling up the plane, i.e. in the positive direction) and the component of gravity m₂g sinθ (pulling down the plane). Hence,\n  T − m₂g sinθ = m₂a.\n\nAdd these two equations to eliminate T:\n  m₁g − m₂g sinθ = (m₁ + m₂)a.\nThus, the acceleration is\n  a = (m₁g − m₂g sinθ)/(m₁ + m₂).      (1)\n\nThen, using (1) in, say, the first equation to obtain T, we have\n  T = m₁g − m₁a\n    = m₁g − m₁ (m₁g − m₂g sinθ)/(m₁ + m₂)\n    = [m₁(m₁ + m₂)g − m₁²g + m₁m₂g sinθ]⁄(m₁ + m₂)\n    = [m₁m₂g + m₁m₂g sinθ]⁄(m₁ + m₂)\n    = (m₁m₂g(1+ sinθ))/(m₁+m₂).     (2)\n\nThus, when the wedge is held fixed we obtain\n\n  a = (m₁g − m₂g sinθ)/(m₁+m₂),\n  T = (m₁m₂g(1+ sinθ))/(m₁+m₂).\n\nA quick check of the units and limits shows that these answers are acceptable.\n\n──────────────────────────\nStep 2. (Wedge free to move: find μmin so that it remains at rest)\n\nNow we wish to know how “sticky” the floor must be—in other words, how large μ must be—so that the wedge remains at rest even though it is being “pushed” by the forces from the dynamics of m₁ and m₂.\n\nAlthough the wedge does not move, it is subject to horizontal forces that must be balanced by friction from the floor. There are two sources of force on the wedge:\n (a) the contact force from the sliding mass m₂,\n (b) the force transmitted through the peg by the string.\n\nLet us analyze these one by one.\n\n──────────────────────────\n2(a) The contact force from m₂\n\nThe block m₂ is in contact with the smooth inclined surface of the wedge. Its weight produces a normal force N on the surface. (Because m₂ slides without acceleration normal to the surface – its acceleration is along the plane – we have)\n  N = m₂g cosθ.\nThis normal force acts perpendicular to the surface. (Choose a coordinate system in which the horizontal (x) axis is to the right and the vertical (y) axis is upward. For an incline with its “up‐the–plane” direction making an angle θ with the horizontal, a unit normal (pointing out of the wedge) is\n  n = (– sinθ, cosθ).)\nBy Newton’s third law, m₂ exerts on the wedge the reaction force Fₙ = –N n. That is,\n  Fₙ = – m₂g cosθ (– sinθ, cosθ)\n     = (m₂g cosθ sinθ, – m₂g cos²θ).     (3)\n\nNotice that the horizontal (x) component of Fₙ is\n  (Fₙ)_x = m₂g cosθ sinθ.\n\n──────────────────────────\n2(b) The force from the string via the peg\n\nThe string passes over a smooth peg fixed to the wedge. (If you imagine “removing” the string and isolating the peg, then by the usual arguments the string exerts on the peg forces along each segment equal to the tension T.) On one side the string is attached to m₁; since m₁ hangs vertically, the string exerts a force of magnitude T on the peg in the vertical direction. On the other side, the string is attached to m₂; since m₂ is on the incline the string along that side is directed along the plane. (More precisely, the string leaves the peg along the line joining the peg to m₂. Since m₂ slides on the plane, this direction is along the plane; it is “down the plane” because m₂ is being pulled upward along the plane by the string.) Thus the two forces on the peg (and hence on the wedge) are:\n • From the m₁ side:  F₁ = T (0, –1)  (i.e. downward)\n • From the m₂ side:  F₂ = T (– cosθ, – sinθ)  (since the unit vector “down the plane” is (– cosθ, – sinθ).)\nThus the net force from the string acting on the peg (and so on the wedge) is\n  F_string = F₁ + F₂ = T (– cosθ, – (1+ sinθ) ). \nBy Newton’s third law the wedge “feels” the opposite of this, hence\n  F_rope = – F_string = T (cosθ, 1+ sinθ).     (4)\n\nHere the horizontal (x) component is\n  (F_rope)_x = T cosθ.\n\n──────────────────────────\n2(c) Total force on the wedge and the friction condition\n\nThe wedge is in contact with a horizontal floor. Let R be the magnitude of the floor’s normal force on the wedge and f be the friction force. (We will see that the net force on the wedge coming from the “internal” connections of m₁ and m₂ has both horizontal and vertical components. The vertical components must be balanced by R. The friction f is the horizontal force that the floor must provide so that the wedge does not accelerate.)\n\n• The total horizontal force Fₓ acting on the wedge is the sum of the x‐components from (3) and (4):\n  Fₓ = (T cosθ) + (m₂g cosθ sinθ).     (5)\n\nFor the wedge to remain at rest the friction force must be able to counteract this horizontal force. (In the limit, if f_max is the maximum static friction then we require f_max = μ R to be at least Fₓ.)\n\nTo find R we need to sum the vertical forces on the wedge. The vertical forces are:\n – The weight of the wedge: M g (downward)\n – The vertical component of F_rope from (4):  T (1+ sinθ) (upward)\n – The vertical component of the contact force from m₂ from (3): – m₂g cos²θ (downward)\n – The floor’s normal reaction R (upward).\n\nThus, setting upward as positive, vertical force balance gives:\n  R + [T(1+ sinθ)] – m₂g cos²θ – M g = 0.\nThat is,\n  R = M g – T(1+ sinθ) + m₂g cos²θ.    (6)\n\nThen the friction condition (that the static friction is just large enough to balance the horizontal force) is\n  μ R = Fₓ.\nThus the minimum coefficient of static friction required is\n  μ_min = Fₓ/R\nso that\n  μ_min = [T cosθ + m₂g cosθ sinθ] / [Mg – T(1+ sinθ) + m₂g cos²θ].    (7)\n\nIt is best to express this answer entirely in terms of the given parameters. But recall from (2) that\n  T = (m₁m₂g(1+ sinθ))/(m₁+m₂).\n\nThus we may also write\n  μ_min = { g cosθ [T/g + m₂ sinθ] } / [Mg – T(1+ sinθ) + m₂g cos²θ]\nor, substituting T explicitly,\n  μ_min = [ (m₁m₂g(1+ sinθ)/(m₁+m₂)) cosθ + m₂g cosθ sinθ]\n      / [Mg – (m₁m₂g(1+ sinθ)/(m₁+m₂)) (1+ sinθ)+ m₂g cos²θ].\n\nOne may leave the answer in either form.\n\n──────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) When the wedge is held fixed (μ very large), the acceleration and string tension are\n\n  a = (m₁g – m₂g sinθ)/(m₁ + m₂),\n  T = (m₁m₂g (1+ sinθ))/(m₁ + m₂).\n\n(b) In order that the wedge remain at rest the coefficient of static friction must satisfy\n\n  μ ≥ μ_min with\n  μ_min = [T cosθ + m₂g cosθ sinθ] / [Mg – T(1+ sinθ) + m₂g cos²θ],\n      with T = (m₁m₂g(1+ sinθ))/(m₁+m₂).\n\nWe now box the answers.\n\n──────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Boxed Form\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{ \n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad a &= \\frac{m_1g - m_2g\\sin\\theta}{m_1+m_2},\\quad T = \\frac{m_1m_2g (1+\\sin\\theta)}{m_1+m_2},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\mu_{\\min} &= \\frac{T\\cos\\theta+m_2g\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta}{Mg-T(1+\\sin\\theta)+m_2g\\cos^2\\theta},\\quad \\text{with } T=\\frac{m_1m_2g(1+\\sin\\theta)}{m_1+m_2}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nAny answer algebraically equivalent to the boxed answer is correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad a &= \\frac{m_1g - m_2g\\sin\\theta}{m_1+m_2},\\quad T = \\frac{m_1m_2g (1+\\sin\\theta)}{m_1+m_2},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\mu_{\\min} &= \\frac{T\\cos\\theta+m_2g\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta}{Mg-T(1+\\sin\\theta)+m_2g\\cos^2\\theta},\\quad \\text{with } T=\\frac{m_1m_2g(1+\\sin\\theta)}{m_1+m_2}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad a &= \\frac{m_1g - m_2g\\sin\\theta}{m_1+m_2},\\quad T = \\frac{m_1m_2g (1+\\sin\\theta)}{m_1+m_2},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\mu_{\\min} &= \\frac{T\\cos\\theta+m_2g\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta}{Mg-T(1+\\sin\\theta)+m_2g\\cos^2\\theta},\\quad \\text{with } T=\\frac{m_1m_2g(1+\\sin\\theta)}{m_1+m_2}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "a = \\frac{(m_1 - m_2 \\sin \\theta)g}{m_1 + m_2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Kinetic Energy (T)\n\nEach bob moves on a circle of radius l so that\n  T₁ = ½ m (l̇θ₁)² = ½ m l² (θ̇₁)²,  T₂ = ½ m l² (θ̇₂)².\nThus the total kinetic energy is\n  T = ½ m l² (θ̇₁² + θ̇₂²).\n\n2. Potential Energy (V)\n\nThere are two contributions:\n\n(a) Gravitational energy.\nFor small angles, the vertical rise is approximately ½lθ² so that\n  V_grav ≈ ½ m g l (θ₁² + θ₂²).\n\n(b) Spring energy.\nLet the supports be separated by d. In equilibrium (θ₁ = θ₂ = 0) the spring is unstretched since its natural length equals d. When the pendulums swing, the bob of pendulum i is approximately at\n  xᵢ ≈ xᵢ⁰ + l sin θᵢ ≈ xᵢ⁰ + l θᵢ    (i = 1,2),\nwhere we may take x₁⁰ = 0 and x₂⁰ = d. Hence the horizontal positions of the bobs are\n  x₁ ≈ l θ₁,  x₂ ≈ d + l θ₂.\nThus the horizontal distance between the bobs is approximately\n  Δx = x₂ – x₁ ≈ d + l (θ₂ – θ₁).\n(The vertical displacements are of order θ² and need not be kept in a second–order Lagrangian for small oscillations.) Therefore the spring is stretched by an amount\n  Δ = [d + l (θ₂ – θ₁)] – d = l (θ₂ – θ₁).\nThus the spring’s potential energy is\n  V_spring = ½ k (Δ)² = ½ k l² (θ₂ – θ₁)².\n\nThus the complete potential energy is\n  V = ½ m g l (θ₁² + θ₂²) + ½ k l² (θ₂ – θ₁)².\n\n3. Lagrangian\n\nThe Lagrangian L is T – V so that\n\n  L = ½ m l² (θ̇₁² + θ̇₂²)\n    – ½ m g l (θ₁² + θ₂²)\n    – ½ k l² (θ₂ – θ₁)².\n\n────────────────────\nStep (b). Normal Coordinates and Frequencies\n\nFrom the Lagrangian (or by writing the equations of motion) we now derive the linearized equations.\n\nThe Euler–Lagrange equations are:\n\nFor θ₁:\n  d/dt (m l² θ̇₁) + m g l θ₁ – k l² (θ₂ – θ₁) = 0,\nor\n  m l² θ̈₁ + m g l θ₁ – k l² (θ₂ – θ₁) = 0.\n\nSimilarly for θ₂:\n  m l² θ̈₂ + m g l θ₂ + k l² (θ₂ – θ₁) = 0.\n\nDividing both equations by m l² gives\n  θ̈₁ + (g/l)θ₁ – (k/m)(θ₂ – θ₁) = 0,  (1)\n  θ̈₂ + (g/l)θ₂ + (k/m)(θ₂ – θ₁) = 0.  (2)\n\nWe now look for normal modes by assuming solutions of the form\n  θ₁(t) = A₁ e^(iωt),  θ₂(t) = A₂ e^(iωt).\n\nSubstitute in (1) and (2):\n  [–ω² + g/l + (k/m)] A₁ – (k/m) A₂ = 0,  (3)\n  – (k/m) A₁ + [–ω² + g/l + (k/m)] A₂ = 0.  (4)\n\nFor a nontrivial solution the determinant of coefficients must vanish:\n  [–ω² + g/l + k/m]² – (k/m)² = 0.\nThus,\n  –ω² + g/l + k/m = ± (k/m).\n\nThere are two cases:\n\nCase 1: + sign\n  –ω² + g/l + k/m = +k/m  ⇒ ω² = g/l.\nThe corresponding eigenvector is found (say from eq. (3)):\n  (k/m)A₁ – (k/m)A₂ = 0  ⇒ A₁ = A₂.\nThis is the in-phase mode.\n\nCase 2: – sign\n  –ω² + g/l + k/m = –k/m  ⇒ ω² = g/l + 2k/m.\nHere eq. (3) gives\n  –(k/m)A₁ – (k/m)A₂ = 0  ⇒ A₁ = –A₂.\nThis is the anti–phase mode.\n\nIt is convenient to introduce the normal coordinates\n  q₁ = (θ₁ + θ₂)/√2   (in–phase coordinate),\n  q₂ = (θ₁ – θ₂)/√2   (anti–phase coordinate).\nThen the independent equations become:\n  q̈₁ + (g/l) q₁ = 0  with ω₁ = √(g/l),\n  q̈₂ + (g/l + 2k/m) q₂ = 0  with ω₂ = √(g/l + 2k/m).\n\n────────────────────\nStep (c). Response to an Impulsive Force\n\nAssume that initially both masses are at rest in equilibrium (θ₁(0) = θ₂(0) = 0) and so q₁(0) = q₂(0)=0. An impulsive horizontal force is delivered to the left bob giving it an initial velocity v to the right. (For small angles, the horizontal speed of a bob is approximately l θ̇.) Hence the initial angular velocities become\n  θ̇₁(0) = v/l,  θ̇₂(0) = 0.\n\nIn terms of the normal coordinates the initial velocities are\n  q̇₁(0) = [θ̇₁(0) + θ̇₂(0)]/√2 = v/(l√2),\n  q̇₂(0) = [θ̇₁(0) – θ̇₂(0)]/√2 = v/(l√2).\n\nSince the q’s each obey a simple harmonic oscillator equation, we have\n  q₁(t) = (q̇₁(0)/ω₁) sin(ω₁t) = (v/(l√2ω₁)) sin(ω₁t),\n  q₂(t) = (q̇₂(0)/ω₂) sin(ω₂t) = (v/(l√2ω₂)) sin(ω₂t).\n\nFinally, reverting to the original angles,\n  θ₁(t) = (q₁(t) + q₂(t))/√2 = (v/(2l)) [ (1/ω₁) sin(ω₁t) + (1/ω₂) sin(ω₂t) ],\n  θ₂(t) = (q₁(t) – q₂(t))/√2 = (v/(2l)) [ (1/ω₁) sin(ω₁t) – (1/ω₂) sin(ω₂t) ].\n\nThese equations completely describe the motion following the impulse.\n\n────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nAn acceptable answer is as follows:\n\n(a) The Lagrangian is\n  L = ½ m l² (θ̇₁² + θ̇₂²) – ½ m g l (θ₁²+θ₂²) – ½ k l² (θ₂ – θ₁)².\n\n(b) The normal coordinates and small–oscillation frequencies are obtained by writing\n  q₁ = (θ₁+θ₂)/√2  and  q₂ = (θ₁–θ₂)/√2,\nwith\n  q̈₁ + (g/l)q₁ = 0   (in–phase mode with ω₁ = √(g/l)),\n  q̈₂ + (g/l+2k/m)q₂ = 0   (anti–phase mode with ω₂ = √(g/l+2k/m)).\n\n(c) If initially θ₁(0)=θ₂(0)=0 and an impulse gives θ̇₁(0)=v/l, θ̇₂(0)=0, then\n  q₁(t) = (v/(l√2 ω₁)) sin(ω₁ t),\n  q₂(t) = (v/(l√2 ω₂)) sin(ω₂ t),\nso that\n  θ₁(t) = (v/(2l)) [ (1/ω₁) sin(ω₁ t)+(1/ω₂) sin(ω₂ t) ],\n  θ₂(t) = (v/(2l)) [ (1/ω₁) sin(ω₁ t)−(1/ω₂) sin(ω₂ t) ].\n\nThus, the complete answer is\n\n         \n           \n  \\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad L &= \\frac{1}{2} m l^2\\left(\\dot\\theta_1^2+\\dot\\theta_2^2\\right)\n-\\frac{1}{2} m g l\\left(\\theta_1^2+\\theta_2^2\\right)\n-\\frac{1}{2} k l^2\\left(\\theta_2-\\theta_1\\right)^2,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad q_1 &= \\frac{\\theta_1+\\theta_2}{\\sqrt2}, \\quad\n q_2 = \\frac{\\theta_1-\\theta_2}{\\sqrt2},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad q_1''+\\frac{g}{l}\\,q_1=0,\\quad q_2''+\\Bigl(\\frac{g}{l}+\\frac{2k}{m}\\Bigr)q_2=0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\omega_1=\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{l}},\\quad \\omega_2=\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{l}+\\frac{2k}{m}},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad \\text{With initial conditions } \\theta_1(0)=\\theta_2(0)=0,\\;

{"id": "mechanics/1_85", "solution": "We wish to study two identical point‐particles (mass m, charge q) interacting via both a “spring” (with spring constant K and “zero equilibrium length”) and the Coulomb repulsion. (We assume that the particles never collide.) A constant electric field\n  E⃗ = E₀ î\nis applied. (We neglect magnetic effects, radiation, etc.) In what follows we label the positions of the two particles by r₁ and r₂.\n\nIt is often convenient to introduce the center‐of‐mass coordinate\n\n  R⃗ = (r⃗₁ + r⃗₂)/2      (motion determined only by external forces)\n  \nand the “relative coordinate”\n  r⃗ = r⃗₂ − r⃗₁,      (with |r⃗| = d, the separation between the particles).\n\nIn what follows we answer (a)–(d) step by step.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (a): Particles on a Wire\n\nAssume now that the particles are constrained to move along a frictionless straight wire (say, the x‐axis). (Also note that “zero equilibrium length” of the spring means that if the spring were the only force then it would “pull” the two particles together with force Kd when separated by distance d.) On the x–axis the only forces acting on each particle are\n\n1. The external force from the electric field: each particle experiences a force qE₀ in the +x direction.\n2. Internal forces connecting the two particles. (These include the spring force and the Coulomb repulsion.)\n\nSince the spring has zero natural length the spring “force” (its magnitude) is Kd (directed so as to pull the particles together), and the Coulomb repulsion is given (in magnitude) by\n\n  F_C = q²/(4πε₀ d²).\n\nNow, because the particles must remain at a fixed separation d (the wire forces the motion to be one–dimensional and we assume the two particles always remain separated by a fixed d) the internal forces must balance:\n  \n  Spring force = Coulomb repulsion  ⇒  Kd = q²/(4πε₀ d²).\n  \nThis equation immediately gives\n  \n  d³ = q²/(4πε₀K)   ⇒  \n  d = (q²/(4πε₀K))^(1/3).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (b): Acceleration of the Center of Mass\n\nSince the only force acting externally is due to the (constant) electric field, and since the internal forces (spring and Coulomb) cancel in the center-of-mass equation, we have\n\n  Total external force = 2qE₀.\n  \nThus, with total mass 2m the center-of-mass acceleration is\n  \n  a_CM = (2qE₀)/(2m) = qE₀/m.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (c): Small Oscillations in the Relative Coordinate\n\nNow suppose that when the particles slide on the wire their separation undergoes small oscillations about the equilibrium value d. To study this we write the separation as\n  r = d + δ,\nwhere δ ≪ d.\n\nThe (net) internal force on one particle (say, the force on particle 2 due to particle 1) is the sum of the Coulomb repulsion and the spring force. Writing the force (with the sign chosen so that a positive δ gives a net force pushing the particles apart) we have\n  \n  F_int(r) = (Coulomb) − (spring) = q²/(4πε₀ r²) − K r.\n  \nAt equilibrium, r = d and F_int(d)=0 (that is how d was chosen). Then, expanding for small δ we have\n  \n  F_int(d + δ) ≈ F_int(d) + F_int ′(d) δ.\nSince F_int(d)=0 we need the derivative:\n  \n  F_int ′(r) = d/dr [q²/(4πε₀ r²) − Kr] = –2q²/(4πε₀ r³) −K.\nThus at r = d,\n  \n  F_int ′(d) = –[2q²/(4πε₀ d³) + K].\nNow, a useful point: It is often best to derive the equation of motion for the relative coordinate. If we denote the positions along x by x₁ and x₂ then\n  r = x₂ − x₁.\nSubtracting the two equations of motion for m ẍ₁ and m ẍ₂ (with internal forces F_int acting with opposite signs, and noting that the external forces are identical) gives\n  \n  m (ẍ₂ − ẍ₁) = –2F_int.\nThus,\n  \n  δ̈ = –(2/m) F_int ≈ –(2/m)[F_int ′(d) δ] = (2/m)[2q²/(4πε₀ d³)+K] δ.\nThat is a simple harmonic oscillator with angular frequency ω given by\n  \n  ω² = (2/m)[2q²/(4πε₀ d³)+K].\nBecause d satisfies the equilibrium condition Kd = q²/(4πε₀ d²) — or equivalently, q²/(4πε₀ d³) = K – we may substitute to obtain\n  \n  ω² = (2/m)[2K+K] = 6K/m.\nThus, the frequency is\n  \n  ω = √(6K/m).\n\nAlternatively, one may express the answer in terms of the Coulomb constant and d:\n  \n  ω = √(3q²/(2πε₀ m d³)).\nEither form is acceptable.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (d): Motion on a Horizontal Frictionless Table\n\nNow we remove the constraint that the particles lie on a given line. (They now move on a horizontal table.) In this case each particle is free to move in two dimensions (x and y) but the external electric field still only acts in the x–direction. It is best now to work in center–of–mass and relative coordinates defined by\n  \n  R⃗ = (r⃗₁ + r⃗₂)/2   and  r⃗ = r⃗₂ − r⃗₁.\nThen the Lagrangian separates into\n\n(1) The center–of–mass Lagrangian:\n  \n  L_CM = mṘ² – 2qE₀ X,\nsince each charge q experiences a potential energy –qE₀ x. (Here X is the x–component of R.)\nThus the equation of motion for R⃗ is\n  \n  R̈⃗ = (qE₀/m) î,\nwith the general solution\n  \n  R⃗ (t) = R⃗ (0) + V⃗ (0) t + (qE₀/(2m)) t² î.\n(Note that the “2” in the acceleration cancels because the total mass is 2m.)\n\n(2) The relative motion is governed by the Lagrangian\n  \n  L_rel = (m/4) |ṙ⃗|² – V(r),\nwith the “potential energy”\n  \n  V(r) = (1/2) K r² + q²/(4πε₀ r),\nwhere r = |r⃗|. (Recall: the spring potential is (1/2)K r², and the Coulomb potential for like charges is q²/(4πε₀ r).)\nThus the Euler–Lagrange equations give the equation of motion for r⃗ :\n  \n  (m/2) r̈⃗ = –K r⃗ + (q²/(4πε₀)) (r⃗ ⁄r³).\nBecause the force is central (i.e. depends only on r and is directed along r⃗ ), the angular momentum\n  \n  L = (m/2) r²θ̇\nis conserved, where θ is the polar angle in the plane.\n\nThus the energy of the relative motion is conserved:\n  \n  E_rel = (m/4)(ṙ² + r²θ̇²) + (1/2) K r² + q²/(4πε₀ r).\nOne may now “reduce” the problem to quadratures. For example, writing the conservation of energy we find\n  \n  (m/4) ṙ² = E_rel – (1/2) K r² – q²/(4πε₀ r) – (L²/(m r²)).\nThus, one may write\n  \n  t – t₀ = ∫ (m/2) dr/√[E_rel – (1/2)K r² – q²/(4πε₀ r) – L²/(mr²)].\nSimultaneously, the polar angle is determined by\n  \n  θ(t) = θ₀ + ∫ (L/(mr²)) (m/2 dr/√[E_rel – (1/2)K r² – q²/(4πε₀ r) – L²/(mr²)]).\nThese integral formulae (quadratures) completely determine the relative motion. (They need not be simplified further.)

{"id": "mechanics/1_71", "solution": "We start with a planet of mass m moving in a nearly circular orbit (radius R) under two forces: the usual gravitational attraction from a star of mass M and an extra “repulsive” force that is proportional to the distance r, namely\n\n  F_rep = A·r\n\n(with A a constant). (Note: This force is assumed to be small compared to gravity so that the orbit is only slightly perturbed from a Keplerian one.)\n\nBecause the force is central, its effects can be incorporated into an effective potential. The total central force is\n\n  F_total(r) = F_grav + F_rep = – (GMm/r²) + A·r.\n\nThus the effective potential (including the centrifugal term) is\n\n  U_eff(r) = –(GMm)/r – (A/2)r² + (L²)/(2m r²)  (1)\n\nwhere L is the angular momentum.\n\nA circular orbit of radius R is obtained by the condition dU_eff/dr = 0.

When ω_r ≠ ω₀, however, the radial oscillations (which determine the locations of periastron) do not repeat exactly after one revolution. In fact, the angle between successive periastra is\n\n  Δϕ = 2π (1 – (ω_r/ω₀)).  (9)\n\nSubstituting (8) into (9) we have\n\n  Δϕ ≈ 2π [1 – (1 – (3A)/(2mω₀²))] = 2π·(3A)/(2mω₀²) = (3πA)/(mω₀²).  (10)\n\nThus the precession per orbital revolution is (approximately) (3πA)/(mω₀²). To obtain the angular precession rate (precession per unit time), note that the orbital frequency is ω₀ so that the number of revolutions per unit time is ω₀/(2π). Hence, the precession rate (angular velocity of the periastron) is\n\n  ω_prec = Δϕ · (ω₀/(2π)) = [(3πA)/(mω₀²)] · [ω₀/(2π)] = (3A)/(2mω₀).  (11)\n\nIt is often useful to express ω₀ in terms of the parameters.

{"id": "mechanics/2_35", "solution": "We will show that when the double–pendulum (an upper simple pendulum of length 3l with bob of mass m, and a lower simple pendulum of length 4l with bob of mass m attached to the upper bob) oscillates in one of its normal modes, there is one mode in which a particular point on the lower (4l) pendulum does not move horizontally (to first order). In what follows we work to first order in the (small) angles.\n\nLet\n\n  • θ(t) be the small angular deviation of the upper pendulum from the vertical.\n  • ψ(t) be the absolute angle (with respect to the vertical) made by the lower pendulum.\n  • It is often convenient to write ψ(t)=θ(t)+φ(t) so that φ represents the “relative” swing of the lower pendulum about the direction already determined by the motion of the pivot.\n\nIn “small‐angle” approximations we have sinα≈α and cosα≈1; we shall ignore overall constants (and additive constants in the potential) since only the quadratic parts matter.\n\nThe coordinates of the two bobs may be taken as follows. With the fixed pivot (at the origin) we have\n\n  – Upper pendulum bob at point A:\n   x_A ≈ 3l θ   (y_A is not needed here)\n\n  – Lower pendulum bob at point B:\n   x_B ≈ 3l θ + 4l ψ = 3l θ + 4l(θ+φ)= (3l+4l)θ + 4l φ.\n\nBecause the pendulum “rods” (really, massless strings) are straight, every point on the lower string lies along the line making the same angle ψ. (One may think of the lower pendulum as “marked” along its length.) In particular, consider an arbitrary point P on the lower pendulum, whose distance from the upper bob (i.e. from the point where the lower pendulum is attached) is r, with 0≤r≤4l. Its horizontal coordinate is\n   x_P ≈ (position of A) + (horizontal offset along the lower rod)\n      ≈ 3l θ + r sinψ ≈ 3l θ + r (θ+φ).\n\nIn a normal–mode oscillation the time–dependence is harmonic and the coordinates may be taken in the form\n\n  θ(t)= A e^(iωt)   and  φ(t)= B e^(iωt),\nso that the ratio B/A is constant for that mode.\n\nThus the horizontal displacement of P is proportional to\n  3l θ + r (θ+φ) = [3l + r (1+ (B/A))] θ.\n\nNow, if we want the point P not to move horizontally (to first order) under the normal–mode oscillation we must have\n\n  3l + r (1+ (B/A)) = 0        (1)\n\nso that the amplitude of the x–displacement vanishes.\n\nOne might wonder: does such an eigenmode exist and what is the corresponding ratio B/A? (That is, what are the “normal mode” frequencies and eigenvectors?) One may set up the Lagrangian for the double–pendulum. (A careful treatment must take into account that the absolute angle of the lower pendulum is ψ=θ+φ. We shall now briefly describe one standard way of getting the answer.)\n\nStep 1. Writing the kinetic and potential energies (to quadratic order) one finds, after some algebra, that the Lagrangian may be written in the “coordinates” θ and φ as\n\n  T = (1/2) m l² [58 θ̇² + 56 θ̇ φ̇ + 16 φ̇²],\n  V = m g l [5 θ² + 4 θ φ + 2 φ²].\n\n(Here we have substituted L₁ = 3l for the upper pendulum and L₂ = 4l for the lower.)\n\nStep 2. Looking for solutions of the form\n  θ(t)= A e^(iωt)  and  φ(t)= B e^(iωt),\nthe equations of motion reduce to a 2×2 eigenvalue–problem. One finds two normal modes with frequencies\n\n  ω₁² = g/l    (faster mode),\n  ω₂² = g/(6l)    (slower mode).\n\nStep 3. One then calculates the eigenvector ratios (the ratios B/A). (A little algebra shows that in the fast mode, one obtains)\n  B/A = –2.\nThat is, in the fast mode the solution is such that\n  θ(t)= A e^(iω₁t),  φ(t)= –2A e^(iω₁t).\n\nThus the absolute angle of the lower pendulum is\n  ψ = θ + φ = A – 2A = –A,\nso that, comparing magnitudes, the relative phase is such that when the upper pendulum swings in one direction (say, to the right, so θ>0), the relative angle φ is negative and twice as large in magnitude. (The fact that B/A is negative means that the lower pendulum “lags” the motion of the pivot in the fast mode.)\n\nNow coming back to equation (1) we must choose the mode for which a value of r between 0 and 4l exists. Inserting the eigenvector ratio from the fast mode we have\n\n  1 + (B/A) = 1 + (–2) = –1.\nThen (1) becomes\n  3l + r (–1) = 0  ⟹  r = 3l.\nThis value of r (3l) is physically acceptable since r is measured from the point of suspension of the lower pendulum (the upper bob) and 3l is less than the total length 4l.\n\nFor completeness we note that one similarly finds for the slow mode  (with B/A = +1/2) that the condition (1) would require r = –2l, which is not acceptable since r must be a positive distance along the lower pendulum.\n\nThus, we conclude that in the fast mode (with ω² = g/l, and with B/A = –2) the point on the lower pendulum that remains fixed horizontally (to first order) is the one which is a distance\n\n  r = 3l\nfrom the point of suspension of the lower pendulum (namely, from the bob of the upper pendulum).\n\nFinal Answer in summary:\n  The desired point is 3l from the upper bob (i.e. 3l from the suspension point of the lower pendulum).\n\nFinally, we box our answer in LaTeX:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3l}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["3l"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "3l", "expr2": "\\xi = 3l"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "3*l", "expr2": "3*l"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "mechanics/1_23", "solution": "We wish to model the free‐fall of the parachutist (before the chute opens) by assuming that the drag force is proportional to the speed.

In that case the force equation for a falling body (with “upward” taken as positive) is\n\n  m (dv/dt) = mg – k v.\n\nNote that when v becomes “large” the speed will approach a limiting, or terminal, value.

A common choice is to say that “terminal speed is reached” when the speed is 95% or so of 30 m/s (or perhaps 98%); we now explain our answers for parts (a) and (b) with this in mind.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Time to “Reach” Terminal Speed\n\nLet us define t* by\n  v(t*) = 30 (1 – e^(–(g/30) t*)) = 0.95 · 30.\nThen\n  1 – e^(–(g/30) t*) = 0.95 ⟹ e^(–(g/30) t*) = 0.05.\nTaking logarithms:\n  –(g/30)t* = ln (0.05) ⟹ t* = –(30/g) ln(0.05).\n\nWith g ≈ 9.8 m/s²,\n  t* ≈ (30/9.8) (ln 20)    [since ln(1/0.05)=ln20]\n    ≈ 3.06 × 3.00 ≈ 9.2 sec.\nThus, one may say that after roughly 9 seconds her speed is within 5% of the 30 m/s terminal speed.\n\n(Alternatively, one sometimes quotes the “time constant” τ ≈ 3.06 s. Since one’s speed reaches about 63% of terminal speed after one time‐constant and “practically” terminal speed (say, 95–98%) after about 3 to 4 time–constants, one obtains an answer of about 9–12 seconds.)\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Distance Fallen on Reaching Terminal Speed\n\nThe distance fallen at time t (taking x = 0 at the jump point, and letting downward displacement be positive) is\n\n  x(t) = ∫₀ᵗ v(s) ds = ∫₀ᵗ 30 [1 – e^(–(g/30) s)] ds.\n  \nA short calculation gives\n\n  x(t) = 30 t – (30²/g)[1 – e^(–(g/30)t)].\n  \nTaking t* ≈ 9.2 s (the time to reach 95% of terminal speed), we have:\n  \n  x(9.2) ≈ 30(9.2) – (900/9.8)[1 – e^(–(9.8/30)(9.2))].\nLet us compute the exponent first:\n  (9.8/30)×9.2 ≈ 3.0      (approximately)\nso that e^(–3.0) ≈ 0.05. Then,\n  x(9.2) ≈ 276 – (91.84)[1 – 0.05] \n      ≈ 276 – 91.84×0.95 \n      ≈ 276 – 87.25 ≈ 188.75 m.\nThus, in order of magnitude, she falls about 190 m while “building up” to her terminal speed.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Knee “Spring” Compression to Limit Deceleration to 10g\n\nAfter her parachute opens, her speed is reduced to 3 m/s. On hitting the ground she absorbs the shock by flexing her knees, which we model as a spring exerting a force proportional to the displacement from its rest position. (That is, if x is the compression, the restoring acceleration is ω² x, with ω² = k/m where here k is the effective spring constant of her legs.)\n\nWhen she comes to a stop, her initial kinetic energy is stored as spring energy. (Energy conservation “ignoring” losses gives)\n\n  ½ m (3)² = ½ k (xₘ)²   ⟹  k = mω², and\n  xₘ = 3/ω.\n  \nIn a simple harmonic motion system, the maximum (magnitude of the) acceleration is\n  a_max = ω² xₘ.\nBut from the energy relation we have\n  a_max = ω² (3/ω) = 3ω.\nWe are told that this deceleration should not exceed 10g (taking g ≈ 9.8 m/s², so 10g ≈ 98 m/s²). Thus we require\n\n  3ω ≤ 98   ⟹ ω ≤ 98/3 ≈ 32.67 rad/s.\nThis then tells us the minimum knee “bend” (i.e. compression) needed:\n\n  xₘ = 3/ω ≥ 3/32.67 ≈ 0.0918 m.\nThat is, she must bend her knees by at least about 9.2 centimeters to keep the deceleration below 10g.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\nStep (d): Is Air Resistance Proportional to Speed a Good Assumption?\n\nThe model we used assumed a drag force of the form F_drag = k v. In many fluid‐dynamics problems the drag force on an object moving in a fluid is best modeled as proportional to the square of the speed (F_drag ∼ v²) when the flow is turbulent. In the case of a falling parachutist (or any human body falling at speeds around 30 m/s) the Reynolds numbers are very high and the flow is turbulent. Therefore, although the proportional-to-speed model offers a simple differential equation which is easily solved (and which gives a characteristic “time–constant” and an exponential approach to terminal speed), the more physically correct model is one with a quadratic drag law. (For very small bodies or at very low speed – i.e. in a regime of very small Reynolds number – the drag is indeed approximately proportional to speed. But for a human falling at 30 m/s it is not the case.)\n\nThus, while the linear (proportional-to-v) model is mathematically convenient for an “order-of-magnitude” calculation, it is not very accurate for high‐speed free-fall.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The time constant is τ = 30/g ≈ 3.06 s. Thus, if we define “reaching terminal speed” to mean attaining about 95% of 30 m/s, then it takes roughly 9 seconds.\n\n(b) The distance fallen during that time is approximately\n  x ≈ 30t – (900/g)[1 – e^(–(g/30)t)] ≈ 190 m.\n\n(c) To decelerate from 3 m/s with a maximum magnitude of 10g (≈ 98 m/s²), her legs must compress by about 0.092 m (≈ 9.2 cm).\n\n(d) In reality, for an object falling at 30 m/s the drag is dominated by turbulent effects and is more nearly ∝v². Thus, the assumption that air resistance is proportional to v is not very realistic, though it is sometimes used for simple estimates.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &t \\sim 9\\text{ sec (to reach approximately 95% of 30 m/s)};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\Delta x \\sim 190\\text{ m};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{Knee compression } \\approx 0.09\\text{ m};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &\\text{Since at }30\\text{ m/s drag is dominated by turbulent effects (}\\propto v^2\\text{),}\\\\\n&\\text{assuming drag }\\propto v\\text{ is not very realistic.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &t \\sim 9\\text{ sec (to reach approximately 95% of 30 m/s)};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\Delta x \\sim 190\\text{ m};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{Knee compression } \\approx 0.09\\text{ m};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &\\text{Since at }30\\text{ m/s drag is dominated by turbulent effects (}\\propto v^2\\text{),}\\\\\n&\\text{assuming drag }\\propto v\\text{ is not very realistic.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &t \\sim 9\\text{ sec (to reach approximately 95% of 30 m/s)};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\Delta x \\sim 190\\text{ m};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{Knee compression } \\approx 0.09\\text{ m};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &\\text{Since at }30\\text{ m/s drag is dominated by turbulent effects (}\\propto v^2\\text{),}\\\\\n&\\text{assuming drag }\\propto v\\text{ is not very realistic.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "t \\rightarrow \\infty"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &t \\sim 9\\text{ sec (to reach approximately 95% of 30 m/s)};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\Delta x \\sim 190\\text{ m};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{Knee compression } \\approx 0.09\\text{ m};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &\\text{Since at }30\\text{ m/s drag is dominated by turbulent effects (}\\propto v^2\\text{),}\\\\\n&\\text{assuming drag }\\propto v\\text{ is not very realistic.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "x \\rightarrow \\infty"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &t \\sim 9\\text{ sec (to reach approximately 95% of 30 m/s)};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\Delta x \\sim 190\\text{ m};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{Knee compression } \\approx 0.09\\text{ m};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &\\text{Since at }30\\text{ m/s drag is dominated by turbulent effects (}\\propto v^2\\text{),}\\\\\n&\\text{assuming drag }\\propto v\\text{ is not very realistic.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\xi = 0.102"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

In the “higher–frequency” mode the relative rotation of the bar is opposite in sign to the swing of the string and—with a magnitude about 2 times larger—the bar “almost tries to cancel” the swing motion; in the lower–frequency mode the bar rotates almost as a rigid whole with the string.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThus one acceptable answer is as follows:\n\nThe small–oscillation frequencies are\n\n   ω₁² = (2g/l)(2 + √3)  and  ω₂² = (2g/l)(2 − √3).\n\nA corresponding set of normal–modes (writing the solution as [θ, α] ∝ [1, r] with\n  r = – (2ω² – g/l)/(ω² – g/l))\nis\n\n  For ω₁: [θ, α] ∝ [1, – (7 + 4√3)/(3 + 2√3)],\n  For ω₂: [θ, α] ∝ [1, – (7 − 4√3)/(3 − 2√3)].\n\nAny answer that is algebraically equivalent is correct.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Boxed Format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega_1^2 &= \\frac{2g}{l}(2+\\sqrt{3}),\\quad \\omega_2^2 = \\frac{2g}{l}(2-\\sqrt{3}),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{with normal modes }[ \\theta, \\alpha] &\\propto \\begin{cases}\n\\Bigl[1,\\; -\\dfrac{7+4\\sqrt{3}}{3+2\\sqrt{3}}\\Bigr] \\quad \\text{for } \\omega_1,\\\\[1mm]\n\\Bigl[1,\\; -\\dfrac{7-4\\sqrt{3}}{3-2\\sqrt{3}}\\Bigr] \\quad \\text{for } \\omega_2.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nAny answer algebraically equivalent to the above is correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega_1^2 &= \\frac{2g}{l}(2+\\sqrt{3}),\\quad \\omega_2^2 = \\frac{2g}{l}(2-\\sqrt{3}),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{with normal modes }[ \\theta, \\alpha] &\\propto \\begin{cases}\n\\Bigl[1,\\; -\\dfrac{7+4\\sqrt{3}}{3+2\\sqrt{3}}\\Bigr] \\quad \\text{for } \\omega_1,\\\\[1mm]\n\\Bigl[1,\\; -\\dfrac{7-4\\sqrt{3}}{3-2\\sqrt{3}}\\Bigr] \\quad \\text{for } \\omega_2.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega_1^2 &= \\frac{2g}{l}(2+\\sqrt{3}),\\quad \\omega_2^2 = \\frac{2g}{l}(2-\\sqrt{3}),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{with normal modes }[ \\theta, \\alpha] &\\propto \\begin{cases}\n\\Bigl[1,\\; -\\dfrac{7+4\\sqrt{3}}{3+2\\sqrt{3}}\\Bigr] \\quad \\text{for } \\omega_1,\\\\[1mm]\n\\Bigl[1,\\; -\\dfrac{7-4\\sqrt{3}}{3-2\\sqrt{3}}\\Bigr] \\quad \\text{for } \\omega_2.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\omega_1 = (\\sqrt{3} + 1) \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{l}}, \\quad \\omega_2 = (\\sqrt{3} - 1) \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{l}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "mechanics/1_100", "solution": "We will show that effects of the Earth’s rotation give two very different “horizontal‐offsets.” One is the well–known “plumb–line deflection” (the fact that the vertical defined by “free–fall” does not point to the center of the Earth but in the “effective‐gravity” direction) and the other is the eastward deflection of a body dropped from “rest” relative to the building. (In what follows we neglect air–resistance and assume that the tower is “short” compared with the radius of the Earth.) For numerical estimates we take\n\n • L = 61 m (a commonly–quoted height for Sather Tower)  \n • θ = 38° (approximately the Berkeley latitude)  \n • g = 9.8 m/s²  \n • R = 6.37×10⁶ m  \n • Ω = 7.2921×10⁻⁵ rad/s\n\nLet us now describe the two parts in detail.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. (a) Plumb–line “deflection”\n\nWhen we hang a bob on a string, the bob comes to rest along the direction of the “effective gravity” which, in a rotating frame, is not the same as the “radial” (or geometric vertical) direction. In our rotating Earth there is a centrifugal acceleration whose magnitude is\n\n  a_cent = Ω²r,\n \nwith r being the distance from the Earth’s rotation axis. At a point on the Earth’s surface the distance from the axis is r = R cosθ. However, when “lifting” the bob to the top of the tower the net (full) centrifugal acceleration produces a vertical component (which partly cancels g) and a horizontal component. (It is this horizontal component that “tilts” the direction of the effective gravity away from the radial.) A short calculation shows that in local “plumb–line coordinates” (that is, with z pointing “down” according to the effective gravity) the horizontal, “equatorward” (in the northern hemisphere, toward the south) component is\n\n  a_horiz = Ω²R cosθ·cosθ = Ω²R cos²θ.\n \nThus the effective gravity has “vertical” magnitude\n\n  g_eff ≈ g – (vertical part of a_cent)\n \nand a horizontal “correction” a_horiz. (One may show that the vertical component of the centrifugal acceleration is a_cent,vert = Ω²R cosθ sinθ, so that\n  g_eff = g – Ω²R cosθ sinθ.\nSince Ω²R ~(5.3×10⁻⁹)(6.37×10⁶) ≃ 0.034 m/s² is very small compared with g, a first–order analysis is sufficient.) \n\nThus, the plumb–line will point in a direction making a very small angle α with the radial (or “naively vertical”) so that\n\n  tanα ≃ (a_horiz)/(g – a_cent,vert) ≃ (Ω²R cos²θ)/g.\n \nSince α is very small the lateral (horizontal) displacement at the bottom of a plumb–line of length L is\n\n  d ≃ L tanα ≃ L (Ω²R cos²θ)/g.\n \nNow we insert the numbers:\n • Ω² = (7.2921×10⁻⁵)² ≃ 5.317×10⁻⁹ s⁻².\n • cosθ = cos 38° ≃ 0.788 → cos²θ ≃ 0.788² ≃ 0.621.\n • Thus, Ω²R cos²θ = (5.317×10⁻⁹)(6.37×10⁶)(0.621).\n\nLet’s compute this step‐by–step:\n  5.317×10⁻⁹ · 6.37×10⁶ ≃ 5.317×6.37×10⁻³ ≃ 33.87×10⁻³ = 0.03387 m/s².\nMultiplying by 0.621 gives\n  0.03387×0.621 ≃ 0.02103 m/s².\nThen, dividing by g = 9.8 m/s²,\n  tanα ≃ 0.02103/9.8 ≃ 0.002146.\nThus, α ≃ 0.002146 rad, which in degrees is\n\n  0.002146 × (180/π) ≃ 0.123°.\n \nFinally, the lateral displacement is\n\n  d ≃ L·0.002146 ≃ 61 m × 0.002146 ≃ 0.131 m.\n \nSo the plumb–line bob will be displaced by approximately 13 cm and its deflection will be toward the equator; that is, for Berkeley (in the northern hemisphere) the bob is deflected to the south.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. (b) Eastward Deflection of a Dropped Body\n\nA “dropped” body does not follow a plumb–line. In a rotating (non–inertial) frame the free–falling body suffers no force in the horizontal direction (neglecting air resistance), so it conserves its horizontal velocity. However, the velocity of the supporting ground (or tower) is not the same at the top as at the bottom. (This is because points higher above the surface have a slightly larger distance from the Earth's axis and thus a slightly larger eastward speed.) In an inertial picture the object, released with the horizontal speed it has at the top of the tower, lands slightly east of the point on the ground directly below the release point.\n\nIf we assume that the tower is “vertical” according to the local plumb–line (so that the base and top of the tower have different east–velocities) then the eastward speed at the top is\n\n  v_top = Ω (R + δR) with δR ≃ L (for L ≪ R)\nbut note that since the plumb–line is deflected by a small angle, the “vertical” rise L corresponds approximately to a radial displacement. In contrast the base of the tower moves at speed\n\n  v_bottom = Ω R.\n \nThus, the body is “released” with a relative eastward speed\n\n  Δv = v_top – v_bottom ≃ Ω L.\n \n(In fact, a more careful treatment shows that one must take the horizontal component of L along the direction perpendicular to the Earth’s axis; since L is measured along the plumb–line, its “projection” is L cosθ; that is, the top is farther from the axis by approximately L cosθ. Hence one obtains)\n \n  Δv ≃ Ω L cosθ.\n \nNow, when the body is dropped it falls a distance L in a time (in the absence of air resistance)\n \n  t_f = √(2L/g).\n \nDuring that time the body, having an extra horizontal speed Δv relative to the ground (whose horizontal speed is that of the base of the tower), will move eastward by\n \n  Δx = Δv · t_f = Ω L cosθ · √(2L/g).\n \nLet’s plug in the numbers:\n • Ω = 7.2921×10⁻⁵ rad/s.\n • L = 61 m.\n • cos38° ≃ 0.788.\n • √(2L/g) = √(2×61/9.8) = √(122/9.8) ≃ √12.45 ≃ 3.524 s.\n \nThus,\n  Δx ≃ 7.2921×10⁻⁵ × 61 × 0.788 × 3.524.\n \nLet’s do the arithmetic step–by–step:\n  61 × 0.788 ≃ 48.07,\n  48.07 × 3.524 ≃ 169.3,\n  Then 7.2921×10⁻⁵ × 169.3 ≃ 0.01235 m.\n \nThat is about 1.24 cm. (A more sophisticated treatment including the Coriolis “force” in the rotating frame gives the same order–of–magnitude result.) \n\nThus, a body dropped from the top of Sather Tower will land approximately 1.2–1.3 cm to the east of the point directly below the release point.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The plumb–line bob gets deflected by an angle\n\n  α ≃ (Ω²R cos²θ)/g ≃ 0.00215 rad  (≈0.123°)\n\nso that over a length L = 61 m the bob is displaced sideways by about\n\n  d ≃ 0.13 m  toward the equator (i.e. to the south in Berkeley).\n\n(b) An object dropped from the top (with the initial eastward speed appropriate to its height) will land approximately\n\n  Δx ≃ Ω L cosθ √(2L/g) ≃ 0.0124 m \n\ni.e. about 1.2–1.3 cm to the east of the point directly below the top.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX boxed format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & d \\simeq L\\,\\frac{\\Omega^2 R\\cos^2\\theta}{g}\\simeq0.13\\,\\text{m} \\quad \\text{(directed toward the equator, i.e. southward)};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\Delta x \\simeq \\Omega L\\cos\\theta\\,\\sqrt{2L/g} \\simeq 0.012\\,\\text{m} \\quad \\text{(eastward)}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\] \n\nAny answer equivalent to the one above is correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & d \\simeq L\\,\\frac{\\Omega^2 R\\cos^2\\theta}{g}\\simeq0.13\\,\\text{m} \\quad \\text{(directed toward the equator, i.e. southward)};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\Delta x \\simeq \\Omega L\\cos\\theta\\,\\sqrt{2L/g} \\simeq 0.012\\,\\text{m} \\quad \\text{(eastward)}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & d \\simeq L\\,\\frac{\\Omega^2 R\\cos^2\\theta}{g}\\simeq0.13\\,\\text{m} \\quad \\text{(directed toward the equator, i.e. southward)};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\Delta x \\simeq \\Omega L\\cos\\theta\\,\\sqrt{2L/g} \\simeq 0.012\\,\\text{m} \\quad \\text{(eastward)}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "L \\arcsin \\left( \\frac{R\\omega^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{2g} \\right)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & d \\simeq L\\,\\frac{\\Omega^2 R\\cos^2\\theta}{g}\\simeq0.13\\,\\text{m} \\quad \\text{(directed toward the equator, i.e. southward)};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\Delta x \\simeq \\Omega L\\cos\\theta\\,\\sqrt{2L/g} \\simeq 0.012\\,\\text{m} \\quad \\text{(eastward)}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{1}{3} \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{8L^3}{g}} \\omega \\cos \\theta"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "mechanics/1_48", "solution": "We are told that a heavy meteorite in a circular orbit about Earth suddenly loses 2% of its kinetic energy by colliding head‐on with a much lighter meteorite. Its mass remains unchanged and—importantly—the direction of its velocity remains tangential (no “kick” sideways). In other words, immediately after the collision the meteorite still moves “forward” (with respect to its original sense of motion) but with a speed reduced by a factor of √0.98.\n\nBelow we work through the problem step by step.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Establish the initial conditions\n\nLet\n  m = 1.6×10³ kg  (mass of the heavy meteorite),\n  h = 4.2×10⁶ m  (altitude above Earth’s surface),\n  R_E = radius of Earth (≈6.4×10⁶ m when using approximate numbers) so that\n  r₀ = R_E + h   is the distance from Earth’s center.\n\nSince the meteorite is in a circular orbit before the collision its speed is the circular speed\n\n  v₀ = √(GM / r₀)\n\n(with G the gravitational constant and M the mass of the Earth).\n\nIts kinetic energy per unit mass is then\n\n  K₀/m = (1/2)v₀² = GM/(2r₀).\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Effect of the collision\n\nThe heavy meteorite loses 2% of its kinetic energy but its mass and direction of motion (i.e. the velocity’s direction remains tangential) do not change. Therefore its speed becomes\n  v₁ = √(0.98)·v₀    [since kinetic energy ∝ v²].\n\nIts new kinetic energy per unit mass is then\n\n  K₁/m = (1/2)v₁² = (1/2)(0.98v₀²) = 0.98·[GM/(2r₀)].\n\nThe potential energy per unit mass remains (at that moment)\n\n  U/m = −GM/r₀.\n\nConsequently, the total specific mechanical energy (energy per unit mass) immediately after the collision is\n\n  E = (1/2)v₁² − GM/r₀\n     = 0.98·(GM/(2r₀)) − GM/r₀\n     = –GM/r₀ + 0.98·(GM/(2r₀))\n     = –GM/r₀ + 0.49·(GM/r₀)\n     = –0.51·(GM/r₀).\n\nBecause the mechanical energy in an orbit is related to the semimajor axis a by\n  E = –GM/(2a),\nwe equate\n\n  –GM/(2a) = –0.51·(GM/r₀)   →  a = r₀/1.02.\n\nThus the semimajor axis of the new orbit (after the collision) is slightly less than r₀.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 3. What principles apply? (Answer to part (a))\n\nEven though kinetic energy has been lost in the inelastic collision, the gravitational force is central (always pointing toward Earth’s center). Because no additional torque is imparted (the velocity direction does not change at the collision point), the angular momentum with respect to Earth is conserved. Thus the two important physics pieces are:\n • The central (gravitational) force implies that after the collision the meteorite moves under a central force.\n • Its angular momentum is conserved in the subsequent motion.\nNote, however, that mechanical energy is not conserved during the collision (though it is afterward).\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Describe the shape of the orbit (Answer to part (b))\n\nBefore the collision the orbit is a circle. After the collision the speed is reduced to √0.98 of its circular value. At the collision point the motion is still tangential but the energy is lower than that required for a circular orbit at that radius. Thus that point becomes the point of maximum distance from Earth (the apogee) of an elliptical orbit. Hence, the post‐collision orbit is an ellipse with the collision point as its apogee.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 5. Find the distance of closest approach (perigee) (Answer to part (c))\n\nWe choose the collision point to have distance r₀ from Earth’s center. After the collision:\n – Speed is v₁ = √(0.98)·v₀.\n – The angular momentum per unit mass is\n  h = r₀·v₁ = r₀√(0.98 · GM/r₀) = √(0.98GM r₀).\n\nFor an elliptical orbit the specific angular momentum is given by\n\n  h² = GM·a·(1 – e²),\nwhere a is the semimajor axis and e is the eccentricity.\n\nWe already found a = r₀/1.02 so that\n  h² = GM (r₀/1.02)(1 – e²).\n\nBut we also have\n  h² = 0.98GM r₀.\n\nEquate these two expressions:\n\n  0.98GM r₀ = GM (r₀/1.02)(1 – e²).\n\nCancel GM r₀ from both sides:\n\n  0.98 = (1/1.02) (1 – e²)\n  → 1 – e² = 0.98 × 1.02 = 0.9996.\n\nThus\n\n  e = √(1 – 0.9996) = √(0.0004) = 0.02  (approximately).\n\nNow, the distance of the closest approach (the perigee) in an ellipse is given by\n\n  r_perigee = a(1 – e) = (r₀/1.02)(1 – 0.02).\n\nCompute the factor:\n\n  (1 – 0.02)/1.02 = 0.98/1.02 ≈ 0.9608.\n\nThus,\n  r_perigee ≈ 0.9608 r₀.\n\nRecalling that r₀ = R_E + 4.2×10⁶ m, if one wants the numerical value one may use R_E ≈ 6.4×10⁶ m so that\n\n  r₀ ≈ 6.4×10⁶ m + 4.2×10⁶ m = 10.6×10⁶ m,\n  r_perigee ≈ 0.9608 × 10.6×10⁶ m ≈ 10.18×10⁶ m.\n\nIf the question asks for the “distance of closest approach to the earth” measured from the center, the answer is about 10.18×10⁶ m; if one wishes the altitude above the surface, then subtract R_E:\n\n  Altitude ≈ 10.18×10⁶ m – 6.4×10⁶ m ≈ 3.78×10⁶ m.\nEither answer is acceptable given the wording.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) After the collision the heavy meteorite continues to move under Earth’s central gravitational force and its angular momentum is conserved (even though mechanical energy is not conserved in the collision).\n\n(b) The orbit becomes an ellipse with the collision point (which was initially at r₀) acting as the apogee.\n\n(c) Using r₀ = R_E + 4.2×10⁶ m, the perigee is\n  r_perigee ≈ (0.98/1.02)·(R_E + 4.2×10⁶ m) ≈ 0.9608 (R_E + 4.2×10⁶ m).\nNumerically, if R_E ≈ 6.4×10⁶ m, then\n  r_perigee ≈ 10.18×10⁶ m (distance from Earth’s center) or ≈ 3.78×10⁶ m above the surface.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\;\\text{After the collision, the meteorite moves under a central (gravitational) force with conserved angular momentum (although mechanical energy is lost).} \\\\\n\\text{(b)}&\\;\\text{The orbit becomes an ellipse with the collision point as the apogee.} \\\\\n\\text{(c)}&\\;r_{\\min} \\approx \\frac{0.98}{1.02}\\,(R_E+4.2\\times10^6\\:\\text{m})\n\\approx 0.9608\\, (R_E+4.2\\times10^6\\:\\text{m}). \\\\\n&\\;\\text{For } R_E\\approx6.4\\times10^6\\:\\text{m},\\;

{"id": "mechanics/1_70", "solution": "We wish to consider a particle of mass m moving under the influence of an attractive central force f(r). We will show that with appropriate initial conditions a circular orbit may exist and then discuss its stability under a small radial perturbation.\n\n──────────────────────────────  \nStep (a): Existence of a Circular Orbit  \n\nFor any central force, the motion is confined to a plane. The polar radial equation is  \n  m r¨ – m r (θ˙)² = f(r)               (1)  \nA circular orbit is one in which the radius r remains constant. Thus, we set  \n  r = r₀ (constant),  \nso that r˙ = 0 and r¨ = 0. Then (1) reduces to  \n  – m r₀ (θ˙)² = f(r₀).  \nSince the force is attractive (f(r₀) < 0), one may write  \n  m r₀ (θ˙)² = – f(r₀).  \nIn other words, given any r₀ we choose as the radius of the circular orbit, the necessary initial conditions are:  \n  • r(0) = r₀,  • θ(0) = 0 (say),  \n  • r˙(0) = 0,  and  \n  • θ˙(0) = √[–f(r₀)/(m r₀)].  \nThus, by selecting the angular speed to exactly satisfy  \n  θ˙ = √[–f(r₀)/(m r₀)],  \none can obtain a circular orbit.\n\n──────────────────────────────  \nStep (b): Stability of the Circular Orbit  \n\nNow, assume that the circular orbit is perturbed slightly. It is convenient to introduce the effective potential:\n  V_eff(r) = V(r) + (L²)/(2mr²),\nwhere the force is given by f(r) = – dV/dr and L = m r²θ˙ is the angular momentum (which is conserved for a central force).\n\nFor a circular orbit at radius r₀ the equilibrium condition is:\n  dV_eff/dr |₍r₀₎ = 0.\nWriting out this derivative,\n  dV_eff/dr = dV/dr – (L²)/(m r³) = – f(r) – (L²)/(m r³).  \nThus at r = r₀, the equilibrium condition becomes  \n  – f(r₀) – (L²)/(m r₀³) = 0  ⟹  f(r₀) = – (L²)/(m r₀³).   (2)\n\nThe orbit will be stable if the effective potential has a local minimum at r₀. That is, its second derivative must be positive:\n  d²V_eff/dr² |₍r₀₎ > 0.\nDifferentiate (dV_eff/dr) with respect to r,\n  d²V_eff/dr² = – f′(r) + 3 (L²)/(m r⁴).\nAt r = r₀, using (2), notice that\n  L²/(m r₀³) = – f(r₀)  ⟹  L²/(m r₀⁴) = – f(r₀)/r₀.\nThus,\n  d²V_eff/dr² |₍r₀₎ = – f′(r₀) + 3 [– f(r₀)/r₀] = – f′(r₀) – (3 f(r₀))/r₀.\nThe stability condition is therefore:\n  – f′(r₀) – (3 f(r₀))/r₀ > 0  \nwhich can be rearranged as  \n  f′(r₀) < – (3 f(r₀))/r₀.   (3)\n\nThis is the relation that must hold among f(r), r, and its derivative for the circular orbit to be stable.\n\n──────────────────────────────  \nStep (c): Force Law of the Form f(r) = –K/rⁿ  \n\nNow assume that the force obeys the power law  \n  f(r) = –K/rⁿ,  \nwith K > 0 (so that the force is attractive). We compute the derivative:\n  f′(r) = d/dr (–K r^(–n)) = nK/r^(n+1).\nEvaluating the stability condition (3) at r = r₀, we have:\n  nK/r₀^(n+1) < – [3 (–K/r₀ⁿ)]/r₀  \n  nK/r₀^(n+1) < 3K/(r₀^(n+1)).\nCancel K and the common factor 1/r₀^(n+1) (noting these are positive quantities) to obtain:\n  n < 3.\nThus, the circular orbit is stable only if n < 3.

{"id": "mechanics/1_46", "solution": "We wish to study the motion of a particle of mass m which, coming in from infinity with speed V₀ and (if “straight‐line motion” were allowed) impact parameter b, is deflected by a repulsive inverse–square force of magnitude k/r². (The force is repulsive so that its direction is radially outward; note that one obtains it from the potential U(r) = k/r since then\n\n  F = –dU/dr = –d/dr (k/r) = k/r².) \n\nWe shall find:\n\n (a) The distance rₘ (or r_min) of closest approach,\n (b) The net angular deflection (scattering angle) χ,\n (c) The corresponding differential scattering cross–section dσ/dΩ.\n\nLet us go through the solution step by step.\n\n────────────────────────\nStep 1. CONSERVATION LAWS\n\nSince the force is central the angular momentum L is conserved. At infinity the motion is almost undeflected so that\n\n  L = m V₀ b.\n \nFurthermore, since the potential falls off at infinity, the energy E is\n  E = ½ m V₀².\n\nWhen the particle reaches its minimum distance rₘ it has zero radial velocity so that its speed is entirely “tangential.” Thus the energy may also be written as\n\n  E = ½ m (vₜ)² + U(rₘ) = ½ m (L²/(m² rₘ²)) + k/rₘ\n     = L²/(2 m rₘ²) + k/rₘ.\n \nThus, equating the two expressions for E we obtain\n\n  ½ m V₀² = (m² V₀² b²)/(2 m rₘ²) + k/rₘ,\nor\n  ½ m V₀² = (m V₀² b²)/(2 rₘ²) + k/rₘ.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2rₘ² to clear denominators:\n\n  m V₀² rₘ² = m V₀² b² + 2k rₘ.\n \nThis may be rearranged as a quadratic in rₘ:\n\n  m V₀² rₘ² – 2k rₘ – m V₀² b² = 0.\n \nSolving for rₘ we find\n\n  rₘ = [2k ± √(4 k² + 4 m² V₀⁴ b²)]/(2 m V₀²)\n     = [2k ± 2 √(k² + m²V₀⁴ b²)]/(2 m V₀²)\n     = [k ± √(k² + m²V₀⁴ b²)]/(m V₀²).\n\nSince rₘ must be positive and k is positive (the force is repulsive) we take the plus–sign. Thus, the distance of closest approach is\n\n  rₘ = (√(k² + m²V₀⁴b²) + k) / (m V₀²).\n\n────────────────────────\nStep 2. SCATTERING ANGLE\n\nA standard approach for central–force scattering is to write the orbit in polar coordinates. (One may also use an energy–angle integral.) In the case of an inverse–square force the answer is well known. (The analysis is essentially identical to that for Rutherford scattering in the Coulomb field.) One obtains\n\n  tan(χ/2) = k/(m V₀² b),\n \nor equivalently,\n  χ = 2 arctan (k/(m V₀² b)).\n\nSome authors define the “deflection angle” as the deviation from the original straight–line motion. In that case one sometimes writes the total change in direction as\n  θ = π – 2δ  with δ = arctan (mV₀²b/k).\nIt is not hard to check that this is equivalent to the answer just given. (One may verify that as b → ∞ the scattering becomes small, χ → 2(k/(mV₀²b)), while in a head–on collision, b → 0, one gets complete reversal, χ → π.)\n\nThus the angular deflection (or scattering angle) is\n\n  χ = 2 arctan (k/(m V₀² b)).\n\n────────────────────────\nStep 3. DIFFERENTIAL SCATTERING CROSS–SECTION\n\nFor a beam of particles the differential scattering cross–section is defined by\n\n  dσ = (number of particles scattered into solid angle dΩ)/(incident flux per unit area).\n\nIt is a standard result (derivable by a simple geometrical argument) that\n\n  dσ/dΩ = b/ sinχ |db/dχ|.\n\nWe already have the relation between b and χ from the above result. Rearranging\n  tan(χ/2)= k/(m V₀² b)\ngives\n  b = (k/(m V₀²)) cot(χ/2).\n\nDifferentiate with respect to χ:\n  db/dχ = – (k/(m V₀²)) (1/ sin²(χ/2)) (1/2)\n       = – (k/(2m V₀²)) csc²(χ/2).\n\nTaking absolute values,\n\n  |db/dχ| = (k/(2m V₀²)) csc²(χ/2).\n\nNow substitute b = (k/(m V₀²)) cot(χ/2) and sinχ = 2 sin(χ/2) cos(χ/2) into\n\n  dσ/dΩ = (b/ sinχ) |db/dχ|:\n     = [ (k/(m V₀²)) cot(χ/2) / (2 sin(χ/2) cos(χ/2)) ] · [k/(2m V₀²) csc²(χ/2) ].\nRecall that cot(χ/2) = cos(χ/2)/ sin(χ/2) and csc²(χ/2)=1/sin²(χ/2). Thus,\n  dσ/dΩ = (k²/(2·2 m²V₀⁴)) · [ (cos(χ/2)/(sin(χ/2))·1/sin²(χ/2) )/( sin(χ/2) cos(χ/2)) ]\n     = (k²/(4 m² V₀⁴)) · 1/sin⁴(χ/2).\nThat is,\n  dσ/dΩ = (k²/(4 m² V₀⁴)) 1/sin⁴(χ/2).\n\nThis is the classic Rutherford scattering cross–section formula for a repulsive inverse–square force.\n\n────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The distance of closest approach is\n\n  rₘ = [√(k² + m²V₀⁴b²) + k] / (m V₀²).\n\n(b) The angular deflection (scattering angle) is\n\n  χ = 2 arctan (k/(m V₀² b)).\n\n(c) The differential scattering cross-section is\n\n  dσ/dΩ = (k²/(4 m² V₀⁴)) [1/sin⁴(χ/2)].\n\nWe now box our final answer in the requested style:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad r_{\\min} &= \\frac{\\sqrt{k^2+m^2V_0^4b^2}+k}{mV_0^2},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\chi &= 2\\arctan\\Bigl(\\frac{k}{mV_0^2b}\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} &= \\frac{k^2}{4m^2V_0^4}\\frac{1}{\\sin^4(\\chi/2)}~.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nAny answer equivalent to the above is correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad r_{\\min} &= \\frac{\\sqrt{k^2+m^2V_0^4b^2}+k}{mV_0^2},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\chi &= 2\\arctan\\Bigl(\\frac{k}{mV_0^2b}\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} &= \\frac{k^2}{4m^2V_0^4}\\frac{1}{\\sin^4(\\chi/2)}~.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad r_{\\min} &= \\frac{\\sqrt{k^2+m^2V_0^4b^2}+k}{mV_0^2},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\chi &= 2\\arctan\\Bigl(\\frac{k}{mV_0^2b}\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} &= \\frac{k^2}{4m^2V_0^4}\\frac{1}{\\sin^4(\\chi/2)}~.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "R = \\frac{k}{mV_0^2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{k}{mV_0^2}\\right)^2 + b^2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "mechanics/1_79", "solution": "Let’s break down what happens step by step.\n\n1. Two identical tuning forks, when sounded simultaneously, produce sound waves that are coherent (with a fixed phase relationship) and of equal amplitude. At a specific point A, these waves interfere destructively. This means that at point A the pressure fluctuations (or displacements) of the two waves cancel each other perfectly, resulting in zero net intensity (loudness) at that point.\n\n2. On the other hand, when either tuning fork is sounded alone, the point A receives a sound intensity I from that single source. So it might seem puzzling: If each fork can deliver a full intensity I at A by itself, how can two forks, which together “should” deliver a combined intensity, yield zero intensity at that point when their waves cancel?\n\n3. The key is that energy is not “lost” when two waves cancel each other at a particular point. The law of conservation of energy tells us that energy can neither be created nor destroyed—it can only be moved around or transformed.\n\n4. In the situation with the two tuning forks, what appears to be a disappearance of energy at point A is actually a redistribution of energy. The interference pattern from two coherent sources involves regions of destructive interference (where the waves cancel, like at A) as well as regions of constructive interference (where the waves reinforce each other to give larger amplitudes than would be produced by one fork alone).\n\n5. Consider a simple example such as standing waves on a string. The nodes (points of zero displacement) correspond to destructive interference. However, the antinodes (points of maximum displacement) have amplitudes that are larger than those produced by a single traveling wave. The energy “missing” at the nodes is present in the antinodes.\n\n6. Similarly, for the sound waves from the tuning forks, while point A experiences destructive interference (zero intensity), other points in space will experience constructive interference where the amplitudes are enhanced (giving intensities greater than I). When you add together the energy contributions over all space, the total energy remains equal to that provided by the two sources.\n\n7. Therefore, the conservation of energy holds because the “lost” energy at the destructive interference point is simply diverted to regions where the waves constructively interfere, doubling the amplitude (and hence quadrupling the intensity) compared to a single source. The overall energy in the sound field is conserved, even though locally (at A) the intensity can be zero.\n\nFinal Answer in LaTeX:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The energy is not lost but redistributed: the zero intensity at A is compensated by regions of constructive interference where the energy is higher.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{The energy is not lost but redistributed: the zero intensity at A is compensated by regions of constructive interference where the energy is higher.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{The energy is not lost but redistributed: the zero intensity at A is compensated by regions of constructive interference where the energy is higher.}", "expr2": "\\omega \\left( \\frac{s_2 - s_1}{2c} \\right) = (2n + 1) \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\quad n = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "Classical Mechanics/2-16", "solution": "We will show that when a massless string is wrapped around a wheel of radius R and the wheel is rotated with constant angular speed ω, the extra (free) length of string—i.e. the “unwound string” length—increases at the constant rate Rω, regardless of whether the wheel turns clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\nHere is one way to see the result.\n\nStep 1. (Geometry and the “No-slip” condition)\n\nImagine a wheel of radius R. A string is wrapped many times around its rim in, say, the clockwise direction. Its free (or tail) end (on which eventually a mass is attached) is initially joined to the rim (glued on) so that when the glue later breaks the string is unwound by the wheel’s rotation.\n\nIf the wheel rotates by an (infinitesimal) angle dθ then a piece of string equal to the corresponding arc length R dθ is “released” (i.e. comes off the circle). (You might worry that if the free end is not fixed to a spool it might “pull” on the string in an extra way. However, the fact that the string is massless and always remains taut together with the fact that the string is forced to leave the wheel tangentially guarantees that the rate at which new string is taken off the wheel is exactly R dθ.

(Unwinding Rate)\n\nSince the motor sustains a constant angular velocity ω = dθ/dt, we have\n\n  dθ = ω dt.\n\nThus the extra length of string Δx that is newly released in the time interval dt is\n\n  dx = R dθ = R ω dt.\n\nTherefore, the rate at which free (unwound) string is created is\n\n  dx/dt = R ω.\n\nStep 3. (Clockwise vs. Counterclockwise)\n\nOne might worry that when the wheel rotates in the opposite sense (say, counterclockwise) the relative positions of the string, the contact point, and the free end may alter the analysis. In fact, although the geometric description of “which side” of the wheel the free end is located on reverses, the only quantity that matters for the rate at which new string is provided is the magnitude of the arc length R dθ; namely, the extra string is always released at the rate R ω independent of the sense of rotation.\n\nThus whether the wheel rotates clockwise or counterclockwise, we have the same conclusion.\n\nStep 4. (Summary)\n\nIf we let x(t) denote the length of string unwound at time t then\n\n  dx/dt = R ω,\n\nso that the unwound string grows linearly as\n\n  x(t) = R ω t + (constant)\n\nand the constant is determined by the initial condition.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{R\\,\\omega}\n\\]\n\nThus, no matter whether ω is positive (counterclockwise, for example) or negative (clockwise), the unwound string increases at the constant rate Rω in magnitude.", "final_answers": ["R\\,\\omega"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "R\\,\\omega", "expr2": "\\text{Length rate} = R \\omega"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "Classical Mechanics/2-11", "solution": "We will show that when a sound wave of frequency ω (or, equivalently, ordinary frequency f = ω⁄(2π)) is sent toward a wall moving toward the source with speed vβ, the wave reflected from the wall is Doppler‐shifted so that at a fixed point (say, where the source/observer is) the incident and the reflected waves have slightly different frequencies. Their superposition produces beats.\n\nStep 1. Doppler Shifts on Reflection\n\nA perfectly reflecting wall “sees” the incoming sound wave and then “re‐emits” it. (One can think of the process as two Doppler shifts.) In the lab frame the speed of sound is v and the wall moves at speed vβ (β positive for motion toward the source). First, from the point of view of the wall the frequency is increased (because the wall is moving toward the source):\n\n  f_wall = f·(v + vβ)/v = f (1 + β).\n\nNow the wall acts like a moving source emitting sound at frequency f_wall. The Doppler formula for a source moving toward a stationary observer gives\n\n  f_reflected = f_wall/(1 − β) = f (1 + β)/(1 − β).\n\nThus, the reflected wave has an angular frequency\n\n  ω_reflected = ω·(1 + β)/(1 − β).\n\nStep 2. Superposition and the Beat Frequency\n\nThe incident wave (as measured at x = 0 where the observer is located) is\n\n  y_i(t) = A cos(ωt),\n\nand the reflected wave is\n\n  y_r(t) = A cos[ω_reflected t] = A cos[ω (1 + β)/(1 − β) t].\n\nTheir sum is\n\n  y(t) = y_i(t) + y_r(t)\n     = A cos(ωt) + A cos[ω (1+β)/(1−β) t].\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity\n\n  cos α + cos β = 2 cos[(α + β)/2] cos[(α − β)/2],\nwe write\n\n  y(t) = 2A cos[½(ω_reflected + ω)t] · cos[½(ω_reflected − ω)t].\n\nThus the wave is an oscillation at the average (or “carrier”) frequency modulated by an envelope (or “beat”) oscillation. In many situations (especially in acoustics) one hears the beats at a frequency equal to the number of amplitude “pulses” per second. (A little algebra will make it clear that if you add two sinusoids of frequencies f₁ and f₂ in Hz the number of beats per second is |f₁ − f₂|.)\n\nIn our case, letting f = ω/(2π) and\n  f_reflected = ω_reflected/(2π) = f (1+β)/(1−β),\nthe beat frequency is the difference\n\n  f_beat = f_reflected − f = f [ (1+β)/(1−β) − 1 ].\n\nA short calculation shows\n  (1+β)/(1−β) − 1 = [(1+β) − (1−β)]/(1−β) = (2β)/(1−β),\nso that\n\n  f_beat = f (2β)/(1−β).\n\nThus, the observed beat frequency (the number of beats per second) is\n\n  f_beat = (2f β)/(1 − β).\n\n(In angular frequency units one might write (ω_reflected − ω) but then notice that the envelope in the cosine is cos[((ω_reflected − ω)/2)t] and its “frequency” in Hz is (ω_reflected − ω)/(2π) so that the beat frequency is still f_reflected − f.)\n\nFor many practical purposes the wall is moving quite slowly (β ≪ 1), and then\n\n  f_beat ≈ 2β f.\n\nStep 3. A Numerical Example\n\nThe human audible range is roughly 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Suppose we have an incident sound near the bottom of the range (say, f ≈ 20 Hz) and we wish the interference (or “beat‐tracked”) sound to lie near the top of the audible range (≈20 kHz). (That is, we want the difference between the Doppler‐shifted and the original sound to be about 20 kHz.) Setting\n\n  f_beat = 20,000 Hz  and  f = 20 Hz,\nthe exact formula\n\n  f_beat = (2f β)/(1 − β)\nbecomes\n\n  20,000 = (2 · 20 · β)/(1 − β) → 20,000 = (40β)/(1 − β).\n\nSolve for β:\n\n  40β = 20,000 (1 − β)\n  40β = 20,000 − 20,000β\n  40β + 20,000β = 20,000\n  20,040β = 20,000\n  β ≈ 20,000/20,040 ≈ 0.998.\n\nSince β = (wall speed)/v and v is approximately 343 m/s for sound in air, the wall would have to be moving at about\n\n  v_wall = β v ≈ 0.998 × 343 m/s ≈ 342 m/s.\n\nThis is nearly the speed of sound and is completely unrealistic for a wall. (In practice the walls do not move nearly that fast; here the example illustrates how extreme the Doppler enhancement is.)\n\nFinal Answer\n\nThus, the observer hears beats at a frequency\n\n  f_beat = f ((1+β)/(1−β) − 1) = (2fβ)/(1−β).\n\nFor the case f ≈ 20 Hz, in order for f_beat to be around 20 kHz the wall would have to move with\n\n  β ≈ 0.998   (v_wall ≈ 342 m/s).\n\nIn boxed form the final answer is:\n\n  \\[\n\\boxed{ f_{\\text{beat}} = \\frac{2f\\,\\beta}{1-\\beta} \\quad\\text{and for } f\\simeq 20\\,\\text{Hz,\\, to get } f_{\\text{beat}}\\simeq 20\\,\\text{kHz},\\, \\beta\\approx0.998 \\, (\\text{so } v_{\\text{wall}}\\approx343\\,\\text{m/s}). }\n\\]", "final_answers": ["f_{\\text{beat}} = \\frac{2f\\,\\beta}{1-\\beta} \\quad\\text{and for } f\\simeq 20\\,\\text{Hz,\\, to get } f_{\\text{beat}}\\simeq 20\\,\\text{kHz},\\, \\beta\\approx0.998 \\, (\\text{so } v_{\\text{wall}}\\approx343\\,\\text{m/s})."], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "f_{\\text{beat}} = \\frac{2f\\,\\beta}{1-\\beta} \\quad\\text{and for } f\\simeq 20\\,\\text{Hz,\\, to get } f_{\\text{beat}}\\simeq 20\\,\\text{kHz},\\, \\beta\\approx0.998 \\, (\\text{so } v_{\\text{wall}}\\approx343\\,\\text{m/s}).", "expr2": "\\omega_{\\text{beat}} = \\frac{\\omega}{1-\\beta}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "f_{\\text{beat}} = \\frac{2f\\,\\beta}{1-\\beta} \\quad\\text{and for } f\\simeq 20\\,\\text{Hz,\\, to get } f_{\\text{beat}}\\simeq 20\\,\\text{kHz},\\, \\beta\\approx0.998 \\, (\\text{so } v_{\\text{wall}}\\approx343\\,\\text{m/s}).", "expr2": "\\beta \\approx 0.999001"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

In a head–on collision, the effective energy available is maximized because the collision is “most violent.”\n\nIn the lab frame where the photon has energy E_γ and the proton has energy E_p (and we assume the proton’s mass mₚ ≈ 938 MeV with momentum pₚ ≈ E_p for ultrarelativistic protons), the invariant s is given by\n  s = mₚ² + 2E_γE_p(1 – cos θ),\nwith θ = π for a head–on collision (cos π = –1). Thus,\n  1 – cos θ = 1 – (–1) = 2,\nso that\n  s = mₚ² + 4E_γE_p.\n\nAt threshold the final state invariant mass must equal (mₚ + m_π)². Thus, set\n\n  mₚ² + 4E_γE_p^th = (mₚ + m_π)².\n\nSolve for the threshold proton energy E_p^th:\n  E_p^th = [ (mₚ + m_π)² – mₚ² ] / (4E_γ) = (2mₚ m_π + m_π²)/(4E_γ).\n\nWe already computed the numerator to be 271485 MeV². However, we must pay attention to units. The energy of the photon is given as 10⁻³ eV. Convert that to MeV:\n  1 eV = 10⁻⁶ MeV  ⟹  10⁻³ eV = 10⁻³ × 10⁻⁶ MeV = 10⁻⁹ MeV.\n\nThus,\n  E_p^th = 271485 MeV² / (4 × 10⁻⁹ MeV) = 271485/(4×10⁻⁹) MeV.\n\nPerforming the division:\n  271485 / 4 ≈ 67871.25,\nso\n  E_p^th ≈ 67871.25 × 10⁹ MeV = 6.787125 × 10¹³ MeV.\n\nIt is often more intuitive to express this in electron volts.

(The slight numerical differences stem from rounding, but the order of magnitude is the key point.)\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (c): Implications for the Cosmic-Ray Proton Spectrum\n\nThe result of part (b) is very significant. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons have typical energies around 10⁻³ eV. The proton threshold for pion production in a head–on collision with a CMB photon is around 7 × 10¹⁹ eV. This is the well-known Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff: cosmic-ray protons with energies above roughly 10²⁰ eV have enough energy (in the proton-photon CM system) to produce pions when colliding with the pervasive CMB. As a result, such ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays will lose energy rapidly via the photoproduction process when traveling over cosmological distances. Consequently, one expects a suppression (cutoff) in the cosmic-ray proton spectrum above about 10²⁰ eV.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The threshold photon energy (in the lab, with the proton at rest) is \n  E_γ^th = [(938 + 135)² – 938²] / (2×938) ≈ 145 MeV.\n\n(b) For a 10⁻³ eV photon, the minimum proton energy to produce a pion in a head–on collision is \n  E_p^th ≈ (271485 MeV²)/(4×10⁻⁹ MeV) ≈ 6.8 × 10¹³ MeV, which is about 7 × 10¹⁹ eV.\n\n(c) These results imply that cosmic-ray protons with energies above ~10²⁰ eV will interact with the CMB and lose energy via pion photoproduction (“the GZK cutoff”).

In a time dt the object sweeps out a volume ~ A·(v dt) (where A is the cross–sectional area). If the density of air is ρ, then the mass of air struck is ρA(v dt).\n\nAssume that in a collision the air molecules are “kicked” to move with speed ~ v (or, more properly, they acquire momentum on the order of m_air·v). (One may imagine the collisions being nearly elastic or inelastic; the simple point is that the momentum transfer per collision is proportional to v.) Then, the momentum transferred per unit time (force) is roughly\n\n  F_air ~ (momentum per particle)*(number of collisions per second)\n      ~ (m_air v) · [ρA v/m_air] = ρA v².\n\nSince the force is opposite in direction to the velocity, we write\n\n  F_air = – (constant) ·ρA v².\n\nIn practice one writes\n  F_air = – (1/2) C_D ρA v²,\nwhere C_D is the “drag coefficient” (dimensionless), which in our simple model may be taken as a constant of order unity. (Note: the precise numerical factor depends on the details of the collisions.) \n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Air Resistance According to Stokes’ Law\n\nAt low speeds the air drag on a small sphere is given by Stokes’ law. For a sphere of radius R the drag force is\n\n  F_air = – 6π η R v,\nwhere η is the dynamic viscosity of air. (The minus sign indicates that the force is opposite to the velocity.)\n\nSince the drag is proportional to the velocity, the equations of motion become “linear” (and are readily solved). We introduce the constant\n\n  γ = (6π η R)/m.\n\nNow, split the motion into x– and y–components.

For small γ (so that γT ≪ 1), we expand the exponential:\n  e^(–γt) ≈ 1 – γt + (γt)²/2.\nKeeping terms to first order in γ, we have\n  1 – e^(–γt) ≈ γt.\nSubstitute this into y(t) to get:\n  y(t) ≈ (v₀ sinθ + g/γ)/γ (γt) – (g t)/γ \n    = t(v₀ sinθ) + (g t)/γ – (g t)/γ = v₀ sinθ·t.\nThus, to zeroth order we recover the usual “ballistic” result with flight time T₀ = 2v₀ sinθ/g.

One finds that the flight time is approximately\n  T ≈ (2v₀ sinθ)/g · (1 – (γ v₀ sinθ)/g).\n(One may derive this by writing T = T₀ + δT with T₀ = 2v₀ sinθ/g and solving y(T₀ + δT)=0 to first order in γ.)\n\nNow, with the flight time T we obtain the horizontal range Rₓ:\n  Rₓ = x(T) = (v₀ cosθ/γ)(1 – e^(–γ T)).\nFor small γT use the expansion:\n  1 – e^(–γT) ≈ γT – (γT)²/2.\nThus,\n  Rₓ ≈ v₀ cosθ (T – (γT²)/2).\nSubstitute T ≈ (2v₀ sinθ)/g (to zeroth order) to get\n  Rₓ ≈ (2v₀² sinθ cosθ)/g – (γ (2v₀ sinθ/g)² (v₀ cosθ))/2\nwhich, noting that 2 sinθ cosθ = sin2θ, gives\n  Rₓ ≈ (v₀² sin2θ)/g – (2γ v₀³ cosθ sin²θ)/g².\nFinally, substituting back γ = (6π η R)/m, we may write the first order correction as\n  ΔRₓ = – (2·6π η R v₀³ cosθ sin²θ)/(m g²)\n       = – (12π η R v₀³ cosθ sin²θ)/(m g²).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The horizontal range with no air resistance is:\n    R = (v₀² sin2θ)/g.\n\n(b) A simple kinetic–theory model of air drag gives:\n    F_air ≈ – (constant)·ρA v²,\nso that, in common notation, one writes\n    F_air = – ½ C_D ρA v².\n\n(c) With Stokes’ law drag, the equations of motion have solutions\n    x(t) = (v₀ cosθ/γ) (1 – e^(–γ t)),\n    y(t) = [(v₀ sinθ + g/γ)/γ] (1 – e^(–γ t)) – (g t)/γ,\nwhere γ = (6π η R)/m.\nA perturbative solution (to first order in γ) shows that the flight time is\n    T ≈ (2v₀ sinθ)/g (1 – (γ v₀ sinθ)/g),\nand hence the horizontal range is\n    Rₓ ≈ (v₀² sin2θ)/g – (2γ v₀³ cosθ sin²θ)/g²,\nor equivalently,\n    Rₓ ≈ (v₀² sin2θ)/g – (12π η R v₀³ cosθ sin²θ)/(m g²).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Latex Boxed Format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &R=\\frac{v_0^2\\sin2\\theta}{g},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &F_{\\text{air}}\\approx -\\frac{1}{2}C_D\\rho A\\,v^2\\quad (\\text{or, by a simple model, } -\\rho A\\,v^2),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &x(t)=\\frac{v_0\\cos\\theta}{\\gamma}\\Bigl(1-e^{-\\gamma t}\\Bigr),\\quad\ny(t)=\\frac{v_0\\sin\\theta+\\frac{g}{\\gamma}}{\\gamma}\\Bigl(1-e^{-\\gamma t}\\Bigr)-\\frac{g\\,t}{\\gamma},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{with } \\gamma=\\frac{6\\pi\\eta R}{m},\\text{ and for small drag the horizontal range is }\\\\[1mm]\n&R_x\\approx \\frac{v_0^2\\sin2\\theta}{g}-\\frac{2\\gamma\\,v_0^3\\cos\\theta\\sin^2\\theta}{g^2}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &R=\\frac{v_0^2\\sin2\\theta}{g},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &F_{\\text{air}}\\approx -\\frac{1}{2}C_D\\rho A\\,v^2\\quad (\\text{or, by a simple model, } -\\rho A\\,v^2),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &x(t)=\\frac{v_0\\cos\\theta}{\\gamma}\\Bigl(1-e^{-\\gamma t}\\Bigr),\\quad\ny(t)=\\frac{v_0\\sin\\theta+\\frac{g}{\\gamma}}{\\gamma}\\Bigl(1-e^{-\\gamma t}\\Bigr)-\\frac{g\\,t}{\\gamma},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{with } \\gamma=\\frac{6\\pi\\eta R}{m},\\text{ and for small drag the horizontal range is }\\\\[1mm]\n&R_x\\approx \\frac{v_0^2\\sin2\\theta}{g}-\\frac{2\\gamma\\,v_0^3\\cos\\theta\\sin^2\\theta}{g^2}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &R=\\frac{v_0^2\\sin2\\theta}{g},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &F_{\\text{air}}\\approx -\\frac{1}{2}C_D\\rho A\\,v^2\\quad (\\text{or, by a simple model, } -\\rho A\\,v^2),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &x(t)=\\frac{v_0\\cos\\theta}{\\gamma}\\Bigl(1-e^{-\\gamma t}\\Bigr),\\quad\ny(t)=\\frac{v_0\\sin\\theta+\\frac{g}{\\gamma}}{\\gamma}\\Bigl(1-e^{-\\gamma t}\\Bigr)-\\frac{g\\,t}{\\gamma},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{with } \\gamma=\\frac{6\\pi\\eta R}{m},\\text{ and for small drag the horizontal range is }\\\\[1mm]\n&R_x\\approx \\frac{v_0^2\\sin2\\theta}{g}-\\frac{2\\gamma\\,v_0^3\\cos\\theta\\sin^2\\theta}{g^2}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "R = \\frac{v_0^2}{g} \\sin(2\\theta)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "Classical Mechanics/2-9", "solution": "We wish to know if it is kinematically possible for one of the W bosons produced in\n\n  e⁺ + e⁻ → t + t̄     (with beam energy E each, so total CE energy 2E)\n\nfollowed by\n\n  t → W⁺ + b       t̄ → W⁻ + b̄\n\nto be produced at rest (i.e. with zero momentum) in the laboratory (“lab”) frame. In our problem we neglect all masses except those of the top (m_t) and the W (m_W) and we assume that m_t = 2m_W. (Thus, for example, in the top’s rest frame, the decay products are not produced at rest.)\n\nLet us focus on one of the decays, say\n\n  t → W⁺ + b.\n\nThe idea is that the top quark is produced in the collision with momentum such that, when it decays, there is a configuration (a particular emission angle in the top rest frame) for which the W comes out at rest when boosted back to the laboratory frame.\n\nStep 1. Decay Kinematics in the Top Rest Frame\n\nIn the rest frame of the top quark, the decay t → W + b is a two–body decay. Neglecting the b mass, the W momentum (magnitude) in the top rest frame is given by the usual formula\n\n  p* = (1/(2m_t)) (m_t² − m_W²).\n\nIn the top rest frame the W energy is\n\n  E*_W = (m_t² + m_W²)/(2m_t).\n\nNow, using our assumption m_t = 2m_W we find\n  p* = (1/(2m_t))(m_t² − m_W²) = (1/(2m_t)) (4m_W² − m_W²) = (3m_W²)/(2m_t) = (3/4) m_t (since m_t = 2m_W, note that one may also express p* directly in terms of m_W, but we will stick to m_t when giving the final answer).\nIt is perhaps more transparent to express both quantities in terms of m_t:\n  E*_W = (m_t² + m_W²)/(2m_t) = [m_t² + (m_t/2)²]⁄(2m_t) = (m_t² + m_t²/4)/(2m_t) = (5m_t/4)/2? Let us re‐do that carefully:\n\nBecause m_t = 2m_W, we have m_W² = m_t²/4. Thus\n  E*_W = (m_t² + m_t²/4)/(2m_t) = (5m_t²/4)/(2m_t) = (5/8) m_t.\nSimilarly, we can also write p* as\n  p* = (1/(2m_t)) (m_t² − m_t²/4) = (1/(2m_t)) (3m_t²/4) = (3/8) m_t.\n\nSo in the top rest frame\n  E*_W = (5/8) m_t      and  p* = (3/8) m_t.\n\nStep 2. Boosting the Decay to the Lab Frame\n\nIn the laboratory (or center‐of‐mass) frame, the top quark is produced with energy E (its beam energy; note that since the beams are of equal energy and opposite momentum, the overall CM frame is the lab frame). Thus the top quark has a boost factor\n\n  γ = E/m_t,  with speed β = √(1 − 1/γ²).\n\nWhen the top decays, the energy of the W in the lab frame is given by a Lorentz boost:\n\n  E_W = γ (E*_W + β p* cosθ*),\n\nwhere θ* is the angle between the direction of the W in the top rest frame and the direction of motion of the top (in the lab).\n\nWe ask: Can the W be at rest in the lab frame? For it to be at rest in the lab, its energy must equal its rest mass, m_W, and its momentum must vanish. (In our approximation the energy required to “make a particle at rest” is its rest energy.)\n\nThus we require\n\n  γ (E*_W + β p* cosθ*) = m_W.     (1)\n\nSince we are free to choose the value of cosθ* by selecting the proper emission direction in the top rest frame, a necessary condition for a physical solution is that there exists some cosθ* satisfying |cosθ*| ≤ 1. In particular, solving (1) for cosθ* we have\n\n  cosθ* = (m_W/γ − E*_W)/(β p*).     (2)\n\nA physical solution requires\n\n  | (m_W/γ − E*_W)| ≤ β p*.     (3)\n\nStep 3. Expressing in Terms of m_t (with m_t = 2m_W)\n\nIt is convenient to write m_W in terms of m_t:\n  m_W = m_t/2.\nSubstitute E*_W and p* from above:\n  E*_W = (5/8)m_t  and  p* = (3/8)m_t.\nAlso, note that γ = E/m_t and β = √(1 − m_t²/E²).\n\nPlug these into (2):\n  cosθ* = [ (m_t/2)/γ − (5/8)m_t ] / [β (3/8)m_t ]\n     = [ (m_t/(2γ) − (5/8)m_t) ] / [ (3m_t/(8))β ]\n     = [ (1/(2γ) − 5/8) ] / [ (3β/8) ]\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 8:\n  cosθ* = [ (4/γ − 5) ] / (3β).\n\nFor a physical solution we require\n\n  | (4/γ − 5) / (3β) | ≤ 1.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3β (which is positive for E > m_t) we have\n\n  | (4/γ − 5)| ≤ 3β.     (4)\n\nNow express γ = E/m_t and β = √(1 − m_t²/E²). It is clear that the sign of (4/γ − 5) depends on the value of γ. In fact, note that for γ < 4/5 (i.e. E < 0.8 m_t) the numerator would be positive but such low energies are not allowed because t t̄ production requires E ≥ m_t. Hence for our allowed region (E ≥ m_t, or γ ≥ 1) we have\n\n  4/γ − 5 < 0.\nThus, writing the inequality (4) without the absolute value using \n  5 − (4/γ) ≤ 3β.     (5)\n\nStep 4. Finding the Critical Energy\n\nIt turns out that, when one squares the inequality, a unique solution is obtained. Let x = γ = E/m_t. Then (5) reads\n\n  5 − 4/x ≤ 3√(1 − 1/x²).\n\nTo “find” the special value at which the equality holds, square both sides:\n\n  (5 − 4/x)² = 9 (1 − 1/x²).\n\nCompute the square in the left side:\n\n  (5 − 4/x)² = 25 − (2×5×(4/x)) + 16/x² = 25 − (40/x) + 16/x².\nSo the equation becomes\n\n  25 − 40/x + 16/x² = 9 − 9/x².\nBring all terms to one side:\n  25 − 40/x + 16/x² − 9 + 9/x² = 0.\nCombine like terms:\n  16 + (16/x² + 9/x²) − 40/x = 0  ⟹  16 − 40/x + 25/x² = 0.\nMultiply through by x²:\n  16x² − 40x + 25 = 0.\nThis is a quadratic in x. Its discriminant is\n\n  Δ = (−40)² − 4×16×25 = 1600 − 1600 = 0.\nA zero discriminant implies a unique solution:\n  x = (40)/(2×16) = 40/32 = 1.25.\n\nThus, we have found that the unique value is\n\n  γ = E/m_t = 1.25   ⟹  E = 1.25 m_t.     (6)\n\nStep 5. Interpretation\n\nAt E = 1.25 m_t, the required value of cosθ* from equation (2) becomes\n\n  cosθ* = (4/γ − 5)/(3β).\nSince γ = 1.25, we get\n  4/1.25 = 3.2, so numerator = 3.2 − 5 = –1.8.\nNow, β = √(1 − 1/γ²) = √(1 − 1/1.5625) = √(1 − 0.64) = √0.36 = 0.6.\nThus,\n  cosθ* = (–1.8)/(3×0.6) = –1.\nA cosine value of –1 means that in the rest frame of the top the W is emitted exactly opposite the top’s direction of motion. Then, when boosted with γ = 1.25, the W comes out with just the right energy and momentum to be at rest in the lab frame.\n\nStep 6. Final Answer\n\nThus, a W boson produced from either top decay can be exactly at rest in the lab if and only if the electron and positron beam energies satisfy\n\n  E = 1.25 m_t.\nSince m_t = 2m_W, this is equivalent to E = 2.5 m_W, but the answer in terms of m_t is\n\n  E = 5/4 m_t.\n\nTherefore, while it is highly improbable statistically that a decay will happen with the exact desired angles, kinematically it is possible only if the beam energy E is exactly 1.25 times the top quark mass.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{E = \\frac{5}{4}\\,m_t}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["E = \\frac{5}{4}\\,m_t"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "E = \\frac{5}{4}\\,m_t", "expr2": "E = \\frac{5}{4}m_t c^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "5*m/4", "expr2": "5*c**2*m/4"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

The initial kinetic energy T is\n\n  T = ½ m v² = k/(2r)\n\nand the potential energy V under the original force is\n\n  V = -k/r\n\nSo the total energy in the circular orbit is\n\n  E_initial = T + V = k/(2r) - k/r = -k/(2r)\n\nwhich is negative as expected for a bound orbit.\n\nStep 3.

{"id": "Classical Mechanics/2-15", "solution": "We start with the well‐known “gravity train” problem. For an Earth of uniform density ρ the gravitational force acting on an object at a distance r from the center is given by\n\n  F = – (GM m/R³) r,\n\nsince by Gauss’s law only the mass enclosed (∝ r³) matters. This force is linear in r so that the motion is simple harmonic with an angular frequency\n\n  ω₀ = √(GM/R³).\n\nBut note that for a uniform density sphere we have\n\n  M = (4π/3)ρ R³    so that  ω₀ = √((4πGρ)/3).\n\nThus the full oscillation period is\n\n  T = 2π/ω₀ = 2π√(R³/(GM)).\n\nWhen you drop an object from rest into such a tunnel (assuming no friction) it will execute a simple harmonic oscillation. In order for the object to “return” to its starting point it must have completed a full oscillation (even though the time to go from one end to the other is half of T). Hence the total time is T = 2π√(R³/(GM)).\n\nNow consider the two tunnels pictured:\n\n1. Tunnel 1 is drilled along the rotation axis. In this case the object, dropped from rest relative to the Earth, has only a “vertical” motion along the tunnel and its velocity is parallel (or anti‐parallel) to the rotation axis. (Since the Earth’s rotation vector is along the same axis, the Coriolis force—which depends on the cross product of the rotation vector and the velocity—is zero.) Thus the motion remains one–dimensional and, provided there is no friction, the object will oscillate with the period given above.\n\n2. Tunnel 2 is a “diametral” tunnel whose endpoints lie on the equator. Although the tunnel is a straight line through the center, the object initially has the tangential speed of Earth’s rotation. In an inertial frame the gravitational acceleration still produces simple–harmonic motion along the chord; however, in the Earth’s rotating frame, non–inertial (Coriolis) forces come into play. In practice any friction or imperfections would cause the object to deviate from the idealized path (for example, hitting the tunnel wall). Thus, to guarantee the object performs the ideal, simple harmonic motion (and so returns to its starting point after time T), it is crucial that the tunnel be frictionless.\n\nSo the final answers are as follows:\n\n• An object dropped into either tunnel will return to its starting point after time\n  T = 2π√(R³/(GM))   (which, expressed in terms of density, is T = 2π√(3/(4πGρ))).\n• While no friction is needed in principle for either oscillation, imperfections (or friction) in the equatorial tunnel are especially problematic because the object’s initial tangential speed (and the resulting Coriolis force) make it much more likely to strike the tunnel walls. In the polar (axial) tunnel the motion is purely along the tunnel and is much less sensitive to friction.\n\nThus, the frictionless condition is far more critical for the equatorial tunnel than for the tunnel along the rotation axis.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n  \\[\n\\boxed{T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{R^3}{GM}}, \\quad \\text{and frictionless conditions are especially necessary for the equatorial tunnel.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{R^3}{GM}}, \\quad \\text{and frictionless conditions are especially necessary for the equatorial tunnel.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{R^3}{GM}}, \\quad \\text{and frictionless conditions are especially necessary for the equatorial tunnel.}", "expr2": "T_1 = 2 \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4 \\pi G \\rho}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Apply the capstan equation to the problem.\n\nIn our case, T₁ = T₀ (the tension you provide) and T₂ must be at least the boat’s tension, e^(α)T₀, in order to prevent the rope from slipping. Therefore, we require:\n\n  e^(α)T₀ ≤ T₀ e^(μθ).\n\nDividing both sides by T₀:\n\n  e^(α) ≤ e^(μθ).\n\nStep 3. Solve for the required wrap angle θ.\n\nTaking the natural logarithm on both sides yields:\n\n  α ≤ μθ  ⟹  θ ≥ α/μ.\n\nStep 4. Convert the total wrap angle into the number of windings.\n\nIf the rope winds around the pole N times, the total angle (in radians) is given by:\n\n  θ = 2πN.\n\nThus, to prevent slipping:\n\n  2πN ≥ α/μ.\n\nStep 5. Solve for the minimum number of windings N.\n\nDivide both sides by 2π:\n\n  N ≥ (α)/(2πμ).\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\alpha}{2\\pi\\mu}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\frac{\\alpha}{2\\pi\\mu}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{\\alpha}{2\\pi\\mu}", "expr2": "n_{\\text{wind}} \\geq \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\pi\\mu}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "Classical Mechanics/2-13", "solution": "We wish to study the motion of a particle (of mass m) moving in the effective potential\n\n  V(r) = – (GMm)/r – b/r³                 (2.13.1)\n\nin polar coordinates with angular momentum L. (Here the constant b is positive and—in the case of General Relativity—is given by b = (GM/(mc²))L², but you may just regard it as some positive constant for our purposes.)\n\nIn what follows we will denote the “radius” in the circular orbit by R and consider   \nthree parts: (a) the circular orbit; (b) small radial oscillations (near‐circular orbit) and   \n(c) the corresponding angular motion.\n\n────────────────────\nStep (a): Circular Orbit\n\nFor a central force problem the “effective potential” is\n  U_eff(r) = (L²/(2 m r²)) + V(r) = (L²/(2 m r²)) – (GMm)/r – b/r³.\n\nA circular orbit is characterized by a constant radius, so in equilibrium we must have\n\n  dU_eff/dr = 0 at r = R.\n\nLet us compute the derivative term‐by‐term:\n\n1. d/dr [L²/(2 m r²)] = – L²/(m r³)\n\n2. d/dr [– (GM m)/r] = (GM m)/r²\n\n3. d/dr [– b/r³] = 3b/r⁴\n\nThus the condition becomes\n\n  – L²/(mR³) + (GM m)/R² + 3b/R⁴ = 0.\n\nMultiplying by R⁴ we get\n\n  – (L² R)/m + GM m R² + 3b = 0.\n\nIt is more conventional to write this as a quadratic in R. (In order to clear fractions it is a good idea to multiply further by m:)\n  GM m² R² – L² R + 3b m = 0.\n\nThis quadratic equation in R has solutions\n\n  R = [L² ± √(L⁴ – 12GM m³b)]/(2GMm²).\n\nWhen b → 0 (the Newtonian limit) we must recover the familiar result\n  R = L²/(GMm²).\nA short expansion for small b shows that the solution \n  R = (L² + √(L⁴ – 12GM m³b))/(2GMm²)\nreduces to the Newtonian one (while the smaller solution does not) and is, in fact, stable. Thus, the stable circular orbit has\n\n  R = [L² + √(L⁴ – 12GM m³ b)]/(2GM m²).\n\nOnce R is determined the angular speed is given by conservation of angular momentum:\n  ḟ = L/(mR²).\n\nThus the period of the orbit is\n\n  T = (2π)/(ḟ) = 2π mR²/L.\n\n────────────────────\nStep (b): Small Radial Oscillations\n\nNow we consider a near‐circular orbit by writing\n\n  r(t) = R + δ(t),  with |δ(t)| ≪ R.\nWe now expand the effective potential U_eff about r = R to second order; the linear term vanishes (since dU_eff/dr = 0 at R) and the leading correction is quadratic. That is, the radial motion is governed by\n\n  δ̈ + ω_r² δ = 0,\nwith\n  ω_r² = [U_eff″(R)]/m.\n\nWe already had\n\n  U_eff(r) = L²/(2 m r²) – (GMm)/r – b/r³.\nTaking the second derivative term‐by‐term:\n1. d²/dr² [L²/(2 m r²)] = 3L²/(mr⁴).\n2. d²/dr² [– (GMm)/r] = – 2GMm/r³.\n3. d²/dr² [– b/r³] = 12b/r⁵         (since d/dr (–3b/r⁴) = 12b/r⁵).\n\nThus\n\n  U_eff″(r) = 3L²/(m r⁴) – 2GMm/r³ – 12b/r⁵.\nEvaluating at r = R and then dividing by m gives\n\n  ω_r² = [3L²/(m² R⁴)] – [2GM/R³] – [12b/(mR⁵)].\n\nIt is often useful to eliminate L by using the equilibrium condition. Notice that the circular orbit condition was\n\n  L²/(mR³) = GMm/R² + 3b/R⁴.\nDividing both sides of this by m (or rewriting appropriately) one may show that\n  3L²/(m² R⁴) = 3GM/R³ + 9b/(mR⁵).\nSubstitute this into the expression for ω_r²:\n\n  ω_r² = (3GM/R³ + 9b/(mR⁵)) – (2GM/R³) – (12b/(mR⁵))\n      = GM/R³ – 3b/(mR⁵).\n\nThus, the radial oscillation frequency is\n\n  ω_r = √(GM/R³ – 3b/(mR⁵)).\n\nSo the solution for the small perturbation is\n\n  δ(t) = δ₀ cos(ω_r t + φ₀),\nwith δ₀ and φ₀ determined by the initial conditions.\n\n────────────────────\nStep (c): The Angular Variable φ(t)\n\nFor the nearly circular orbit we have\n\n  r(t) = R + δ(t)  with |δ(t)| ≪ R.\nBecause angular momentum is conserved the angular velocity is\n\n  ḟ = L/(m r²) = L/(m (R + δ)²).\n\nExpanding to first order in δ/R we write\n\n  1/(R+δ)² ≈ 1/R² (1 – 2δ/R).\nThus,\n  ḟ ≈ (L/(mR²)) (1 – 2δ/R).\n\nIntegrating with respect to time (and ignoring second‐order corrections in δ) we obtain\n\n  φ(t) = φ(0) + (L/(mR²)) t – (2L/(mR³))∫₀ᵗ δ(t′) dt′.\nIf we choose φ(0)=0 and substitute δ(t) = δ₀ cos(ω_r t + φ₀) then\n\n  ∫₀ᵗ δ(t′) dt′ = (δ₀/ω_r) sin(ω_r t + φ₀) + (constant),\nso finally\n  φ(t) = (L/(mR²)) t – (2Lδ₀/(mR³ ω_r)) sin(ω_r t + φ₀).\n\n────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) For a circular orbit of radius R we must have\n\n  GM m² R² – L² R + 3b m = 0,\nso that\n\n  R = [L² ± √(L⁴ – 12GM m³ b)]/(2GM m²).\nThe stable orbit is given by the larger (plus) sign, i.e.,\n\n  R = [L² + √(L⁴ – 12GM m³b)]/(2GM m²),\nand the period is\n\n  T = 2π mR²/L.\n\n(b) A small radial perturbation δ(t) obeys\n\n  δ̈ + (GM/R³ – 3b/(mR⁵)) δ = 0,\nso that\n\n  δ(t) = δ₀ cos(√(GM/R³ – 3b/(mR⁵)) t + φ₀).\n\n(c) Finally, to first order in δ, the angular coordinate is\n\n  φ(t) = (L/(mR²)) t – (2Lδ₀/(mR³√(GM/R³ – 3b/(mR⁵)))) sin(√(GM/R³ – 3b/(mR⁵)) t + φ₀).\n\nThese answers (any answer equivalent to the ones given here) are completely acceptable.\n\n────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\text{The equilibrium condition is } GM\\,m^2\\,R^2 - L^2R + 3bm =0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\displaystyle R = \\frac{L^2 + \\sqrt{L^4 - 12\\,GM\\,m^3b}}{2GMm^2}\\quad\\text{(stable)},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\displaystyle T = \\frac{2\\pi mR^2}{L}.\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\delta(t) = \\delta_0\\cos\\Bigl(\\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R^3}-\\frac{3b}{mR^5}}\\,t + \\phi_0\\Bigr).\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\phi(t) = \\frac{L}{mR^2}\\,t - \\frac{2L\\delta_0}{mR^3\\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R^3}-\\frac{3b}{mR^5}}}\\sin\\Bigl(\\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R^3}-\\frac{3b}{mR^5}}\\,t + \\phi_0\\Bigr).\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\text{The equilibrium condition is } GM\\,m^2\\,R^2 - L^2R + 3bm =0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\displaystyle R = \\frac{L^2 + \\sqrt{L^4 - 12\\,GM\\,m^3b}}{2GMm^2}\\quad\\text{(stable)},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\displaystyle T = \\frac{2\\pi mR^2}{L}.\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\delta(t) = \\delta_0\\cos\\Bigl(\\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R^3}-\\frac{3b}{mR^5}}\\,t + \\phi_0\\Bigr).\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\phi(t) = \\frac{L}{mR^2}\\,t - \\frac{2L\\delta_0}{mR^3\\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R^3}-\\frac{3b}{mR^5}}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\text{The equilibrium condition is } GM\\,m^2\\,R^2 - L^2R + 3bm =0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\displaystyle R = \\frac{L^2 + \\sqrt{L^4 - 12\\,GM\\,m^3b}}{2GMm^2}\\quad\\text{(stable)},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\displaystyle T = \\frac{2\\pi mR^2}{L}.\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\delta(t) = \\delta_0\\cos\\Bigl(\\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R^3}-\\frac{3b}{mR^5}}\\,t + \\phi_0\\Bigr).\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\phi(t) = \\frac{L}{mR^2}\\,t - \\frac{2L\\delta_0}{mR^3\\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R^3}-\\frac{3b}{mR^5}}", "expr2": "R = r_+ = \\frac{L^2}{2GMm^2} \\left( 1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{12GMm^3b}{L^4}} \\right)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
