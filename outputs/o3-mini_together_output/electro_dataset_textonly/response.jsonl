{"id": "electro/3_4", "solution": "We begin by calculating the total energy stored in the capacitor bank. Four capacitors of 1 μF each in parallel give a total capacitance\n\n  C_total = 4 × 1×10⁻⁶ F = 4×10⁻⁶ F.\n\nThe energy stored in a capacitor is given by\n\n  E = ½ C V².\n\nWith V = 200 volts, this energy is\n\n  E = ½ (4×10⁻⁶ F) (200²)\n   = ½ (4×10⁻⁶) (40,000)\n   = (4×10⁻⁶ × 40,000)/2\n   = (0.16)/2\n   = 0.08 Joules.\n\nNext, consider the discharge path. The copper wire is 5 mm long (0.005 m) and has a resistance of 4 Ω/m. Hence, its resistance is\n\n  R = 4 Ω/m × 0.005 m = 0.02 Ω.\n\nAt the instant of discharge (assuming the full 200 V appears across the wire), the initial current would be\n\n  I = V / R = 200 V / 0.02 Ω = 10,000 A.\n\nEven though this current is enormous, the energy delivered is only 0.08 J, and it is dissipated in an extremely short time (the RC time constant is τ = R C_total = 0.02 Ω × 4×10⁻⁶ F = 8×10⁻⁸ s).\n\nNow, to see if this energy could melt the wire, we estimate the temperature rise in the short piece of wire. The mass per meter of wire is given as 0.045 g/m. Thus, the mass of a 5 mm length is\n\n  m = 0.045 g/m × 0.005 m = 0.000225 g \n   = 2.25×10⁻⁷ kg.\n\nThe heat energy required to raise the temperature is given by\n\n  ΔT = E / (m c)\n\nwhere c is the specific heat capacity of copper (approximately 385 J/(kg·K)). Substituting in,\n\n  ΔT = 0.08 J / (2.25×10⁻⁷ kg × 385 J/(kg·K))\n   ≈ 0.08 / (8.6625×10⁻⁵)\n   ≈ 922 K.\n\nThis represents the temperature rise above room temperature. Even if we assume a starting temperature of about 20°C (293 K), the final temperature would be roughly\n\n  293 K + 922 K ≈ 1215 K.\n\nHowever, note that the melting point of copper is about 1358 K (1085°C). In addition, not all energy may be perfectly deposited into the wire; some may be lost to other parts of the circuit and through radiation. Moreover, the energy is distributed over the entire discharge curve, and thermal conduction along the wire can further mitigate the local temperature rise.\n\nThus, despite the very high peak current, the extremely low total stored energy (0.08 J) is insufficient to raise the temperature of the 5 mm length of copper wire to its melting point. \n\nThe final answer, therefore, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{No, the wire would not melt because the 0.08 J of stored energy is too little to heat the small mass of copper to its melting point.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{No, the wire would not melt because the 0.08 J of stored energy is too little to heat the small mass of copper to its melting point.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{No, the wire would not melt because the 0.08 J of stored energy is too little to heat the small mass of copper to its melting point.}", "expr2": "\\text{The copper wire will not melt.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "electro/2_13", "solution": "We wish to find the instantaneous fields inside a parallel‐plate capacitor whose circular plates (of radius R) are separated by a distance d (with d ≪ R so that we may ignore edge effects) and which is uniformly filled with a linear dielectric of constant Kₑ. A time‐varying potential difference\n\n  V(t) = V₀ cos ωt\n\nis applied between the plates. (We assume that the plate at higher potential is “on top” so that the electric field points downward.) We now work through the solution step by step.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Electric Field and Free Surface Charge Density\n\n1. ELECTRIC FIELD\n\nIn a parallel–plate capacitor the (macroscopic) applied potential is (to a good approximation) uniformly dropped across the separation d. Therefore, the (instantaneous) magnitude of the electric field is\n\n  |E(t)| = V(t)/d = V₀ cos ωt/d.\n\nSince we assume the top plate is at a higher potential than the bottom, the electric field is directed downward. (We choose the z‐axis to point upward.) Thus we write\n\n  E(t) = – (V₀ cos ωt/d) ẑ.\n\n2. FREE SURFACE CHARGE DENSITY\n\nIn a dielectric the displacement field is given by\n\n  D = ε₀E + P,\n    = Kₑε₀E          (since for a linear dielectric P = (Kₑ –1)ε₀E).\n\nOn a conductor the free surface charge density is (in Gaussian units one also has to worry about bound charges, but here we use SI conventions) given by the discontinuity of the normal component of D. (Inside the conductor, the field is zero.) Consequently, in magnitude\n\n  σ_free = |D| = Kₑε₀ |E| = Kₑε₀ (V₀ cos ωt/d).\n\nIt is understood that the top plate carries a positive free charge (σ_free > 0) and the bottom plate a negative free charge (–σ_free). Thus our answers for part (a) are\n\n  E(t) = – (V₀ cos ωt/d) ẑ      and  σ_free = ± (Kₑε₀ V₀ cos ωt/d).\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Magnetic Field between the Plates\n\nBecause the potential is time dependent, the electric field is time dependent and so is the displacement field D. (No conduction current flows in the dielectric between the plates.) Maxwell’s Ampère–Maxwell law (in SI units) is\n\n  ∮𝐵·dℓ = μ₀ (I_free + I_disp),\n  with  I_disp = d/dt ∫ D·d𝐴.\n\nChoose as our Amperian loop a circle of radius r centered on the axis of the capacitor and lying in a plane parallel to the plates. (We assume r ≤ R; the answer for r > R can be obtained by “saturating” the flux by the full area of the plate.) Inside the capacitor the displacement field is uniform so that for a circular loop of radius r the displaced current is\n\n  I_disp = d/dt [ D(t) (πr²) ] = πr² dD/dt.\n\nSince D(t) = Kₑ ε₀E(t) and E(t) = – V₀ cos ωt/d ẑ, we have\n\n  dD/dt = – Kₑε₀ (V₀ ω sin ωt)/d ẑ.\n\nAlthough the minus sign is present in dD/dt, once we take the magnitude of the current the result is\n\n  |dD/dt| = Kₑε₀ V₀ ω |sin ωt|/d.\n\nNow, by symmetry the magnetic field (if it exists) must be in the azimuthal (φ‐) direction with magnitude B = B(r,t) and the line integral along the circle is\n\n  ∮ B · dℓ = B(r,t) (2πr).\n\nThus Ampère’s law gives\n\n  B(r,t) (2πr) = μ₀ [ I_disp ],\n  with I_disp = πr² (Kₑε₀ V₀ ω sin ωt/d)\n          (we now choose sin ωt with its proper (time dependent) sign, remembering that a negative value of sin ωt will simply reverse the direction of B).\n\nSolving for B we obtain for r ≤ R\n\n  B(r,t) = [ μ₀ Kₑε₀ V₀ ω sin ωt/(2d) ] r.\n\nThe direction of B is determined by the right–hand rule applied to the displacement current. (Since the electric field is downward and increasing in time when sin ωt > 0, the displacement current is in the downward direction so that for a loop in the horizontal plane, the induced B field circulates in the clockwise direction when viewed from above.)\n\nFor r > R the whole plate is “enclosed” and the effective displacement‐current flux is that due to the full plate area πR². Hence for r > R one obtains\n\n  B(r,t) = [ μ₀ Kₑε₀ V₀ ω sin ωt/(2d) ] (R²/r).\n\nThus the answer to part (b) is\n\n  For r ≤ R:\n   B(r,t) = (μ₀ Kₑε₀ V₀ ω r sin ωt)/(2d) φ̂,\n  and for r > R:\n   B(r,t) = (μ₀ Kₑε₀ V₀ ω R² sin ωt)/(2d r) φ̂,\nwith the understanding that the direction φ̂ is such that the field circulates clockwise (when sin ωt > 0) as seen from above.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Poynting Flux through the Open (Lateral) Surface\n\nThe (instantaneous) Poynting vector is defined by\n\n  S = (1/μ₀) (E × B).\n\nInside the capacitor we have found\n  E(t) = – (V₀ cos ωt/d) ẑ\nand (for r ≤ R)\n  B(r,t) = (μ₀ Kₑε₀ V₀ ω r sin ωt)/(2d) φ̂.\n\nThus,\n  S(r,t) = (1/μ₀) [ – (V₀ cos ωt/d)ẑ × ( μ₀ Kₑε₀ V₀ ω r sin ωt/(2d) φ̂) ]\n       = – (Kₑε₀ V₀² ω r cos ωt sin ωt)/(2d²) (ẑ × φ̂).\n\nRecall that in our right–handed cylindrical coordinate system the unit vectors satisfy\n\n  ẑ × φ̂ = – r̂      (since r̂ × φ̂ = ẑ).\nThus,\n  S(r,t) = – (Kₑε₀ V₀² ω r cos ωt sin ωt)/(2d²) (– r̂)\n       = (Kₑε₀ V₀² ω r cos ωt sin ωt)/(2d²) r̂.\n\nThat is, S is directed radially outward (for times when cos ωt sin ωt > 0). One may rewrite the product cos ωt sin ωt as\n  cos ωt sin ωt = (1/2) sin(2ωt).\nThus,\n  |S(r,t)| = (Kₑε₀ V₀² ω r/(4d²)) |sin (2ωt)|.\n\nNow, the open “side” (or lateral) surface of the capacitor is a cylinder of radius R and height d. (Recall d ≪ R.) On the side wall the outward normal is r̂. To find the total flux of S leaving the sides, we integrate over the curved surface. An element of area on the side is\n  dA = (R dφ) dz    (0 ≤ φ < 2π, 0 ≤ z ≤ d).\nSince S is radial and (to a good approximation) independent of z and φ on the side, the flux is\n\n  Φ = ∫ S · d𝐴 = S(R,t) ∫₀^(2π) dφ ∫₀^d (R dz)\n      = S(R,t) (2πR d).\n\nAt r = R, we have\n  S(R,t) = (Kₑε₀ V₀² ω R cos ωt sin ωt)/(2d²).\nThus,\n  Φ = (Kₑε₀ V₀² ω R cos ωt sin ωt)/(2d²) (2πR d)\n     = (π Kₑε₀ V₀² ω R² cos ωt sin ωt)/d.\nWriting cos ωt sin ωt = (1/2) sin(2ωt) gives\n\n  Φ = (π Kₑε₀ V₀² ω R²/(2d)) sin (2ωt).\n\nThis is the net instantaneous energy flux (power) leaving the open edge of the capacitor.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\nWe now summarize our answers.\n\n(a) The electric field and free charge density on the plates are\n  E(t) = – (V₀ cos ωt/d) ẑ     and  σ_free = ± (Kₑ ε₀ V₀ cos ωt/d).\n\n(b) The magnetic field (for a circular loop of radius r centered on the axis) is\n  For r ≤ R:\n   B(r,t) = (μ₀ Kₑ ε₀ V₀ ω r sin ωt)/(2d) φ̂,\n  and for r > R:\n   B(r,t) = (μ₀ Kₑ ε₀ V₀ ω R² sin ωt)/(2d r) φ̂,\nwith the circulation of the field given by the right–hand rule (clockwise when seen from above if sin ωt > 0).\n\n(c) The net flux of the Poynting vector out through the open edges of the capacitor is\n  Φ(t) = (π Kₑ ε₀ V₀² ω R²/(2d)) sin (2ωt).\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Latex Boxed Format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\mathbf{E}(t) = -\\frac{V_0\\cos\\omega t}{d}\\,\\hat{z},\\quad\n\\sigma_{\\text{free}} = \\pm\\frac{K_e\\epsilon_0\\, V_0\\cos\\omega t}{d}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{For }r\\le R:\\quad \n\\mathbf{B}(r,t)=\\frac{\\mu_0K_e\\epsilon_0\\, V_0\\omega\\,r\\sin\\omega t}{2d}\\,\\hat{\\phi},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{For }r> R:\\quad \n\\mathbf{B}(r,t)=\\frac{\\mu_0K_e\\epsilon_0\\, V_0\\omega\\,R^2\\sin\\omega t}{2d\\,r}\\,\\hat{\\phi}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\Phi(t)=\\frac{\\pi K_e\\epsilon_0\\, V_0^2\\omega R^2}{2d}\\,\\sin(2\\omega t).\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nAny answer equivalent to the above is correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\mathbf{E}(t) = -\\frac{V_0\\cos\\omega t}{d}\\,\\hat{z},\\quad\n\\sigma_{\\text{free}} = \\pm\\frac{K_e\\epsilon_0\\, V_0\\cos\\omega t}{d}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{For }r\\le R:\\quad \n\\mathbf{B}(r,t)=\\frac{\\mu_0K_e\\epsilon_0\\, V_0\\omega\\,r\\sin\\omega t}{2d}\\,\\hat{\\phi},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{For }r> R:\\quad \n\\mathbf{B}(r,t)=\\frac{\\mu_0K_e\\epsilon_0\\, V_0\\omega\\,R^2\\sin\\omega t}{2d\\,r}\\,\\hat{\\phi}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\Phi(t)=\\frac{\\pi K_e\\epsilon_0\\, V_0^2\\omega R^2}{2d}\\,\\sin(2\\omega t).\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\mathbf{E}(t) = -\\frac{V_0\\cos\\omega t}{d}\\,\\hat{z},\\quad\n\\sigma_{\\text{free}} = \\pm\\frac{K_e\\epsilon_0\\, V_0\\cos\\omega t}{d}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{For }r\\le R:\\quad \n\\mathbf{B}(r,t)=\\frac{\\mu_0K_e\\epsilon_0\\, V_0\\omega\\,r\\sin\\omega t}{2d}\\,\\hat{\\phi},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{For }r> R:\\quad \n\\mathbf{B}(r,t)=\\frac{\\mu_0K_e\\epsilon_0\\, V_0\\omega\\,R^2\\sin\\omega t}{2d\\,r}\\,\\hat{\\phi}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\Phi(t)=\\frac{\\pi K_e\\epsilon_0\\, V_0^2\\omega R^2}{2d}\\,\\sin(2\\omega t).\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{E}(t) = \\frac{V_0}{d} \\cos(\\omega t) \\mathbf{e}_z, \\quad \\sigma(t) = \\pm k_e \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{V_0}{d} \\cos(\\omega t)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\mathbf{E}(t) = -\\frac{V_0\\cos\\omega t}{d}\\,\\hat{z},\\quad\n\\sigma_{\\text{free}} = \\pm\\frac{K_e\\epsilon_0\\, V_0\\cos\\omega t}{d}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{For }r\\le R:\\quad \n\\mathbf{B}(r,t)=\\frac{\\mu_0K_e\\epsilon_0\\, V_0\\omega\\,r\\sin\\omega t}{2d}\\,\\hat{\\phi},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{For }r> R:\\quad \n\\mathbf{B}(r,t)=\\frac{\\mu_0K_e\\epsilon_0\\, V_0\\omega\\,R^2\\sin\\omega t}{2d\\,r}\\,\\hat{\\phi}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\Phi(t)=\\frac{\\pi K_e\\epsilon_0\\, V_0^2\\omega R^2}{2d}\\,\\sin(2\\omega t).\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{B}(r, t) = \\frac{k_e \\varepsilon_0 \\mu_0 \\omega V_0}{2d} r \\sin(\\omega t) \\mathbf{e}_{\\theta}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "electro/2_14", "solution": "We wish to find the (a) magnetic field at a point between the plates and (b) give an idea of how one might “pick up” that field. In what follows we explain step‐by‐step.\n\n────────────────────────────  \nStep 1. Determine the Displacement Current\n\nBetween the capacitor plates the (assumed uniform) electric field is\n\n  E(t) = V(t)/d = (V₀ sin ωt)/d.\n\nIts time derivative is\n\n  dE/dt = (V₀ ω cos ωt)/d.\n\nNow, choose a circle of radius r (with r < R) centered on the axis of the capacitor; its area is\n\n  A = πr².\n\nThe rate of change of the electric flux through that circle is\n\n  dΦ_E/dt = A dE/dt = πr² (V₀ ω cos ωt)/d.\n\nMaxwell’s extension of Ampère’s law tells us that the “displacement current” is defined by\n\n  I_d = ε₀ (dΦ_E/dt) = ε₀ πr² (V₀ ω cos ωt)/d.\n\n────────────────────────────  \nStep 2. Use Ampère–Maxwell’s Law to Find B\n\nNow choose an Amperian loop that is a circle of radius r (with r < R) lying in a plane midway between the plates. By symmetry the magnetic field will be tangent (azimuthal) to this circle and constant in magnitude on it. Then Ampère’s law (with Maxwell’s correction) gives\n\n  ∮B · dl = B(2πr) = μ₀ I_d = μ₀ ε₀ πr² (V₀ ω cos ωt)/d.\n\nThus, solving for B we get\n\n  B(r,t) = (μ₀ ε₀ V₀ ω r cos ωt)/(2d).\n\nSince the displacement “current” flows in the same direction as would a conduction current from one plate toward the other, the right–hand rule tells us that B is directed tangentially (that is, in the φ–direction in cylindrical coordinates). (For example, if the upper plate is at a higher potential than the lower plate, then the displacement current points from the top to the bottom and B will circle the axis in the direction given by the right–hand rule.)\n\n────────────────────────────  \nAnswer (a):\n\nThe magnetic induction at a point a distance r from the axis (with r < R) is\n\n  B(r,t) = (μ₀ ε₀ V₀ ω r cos ωt)/(2d),\n\nand it is directed along the tangents to circles centered on the axis.  \n \n────────────────────────────  \nStep 3. How Might One Measure B?\n\nOne method to “detect” this very small, time‐varying magnetic field is to use a pickup coil. Here is one possible arrangement:\n\n• Place a small circular loop (or coil) of wire in the region between the capacitor plates so that its plane is nearly perpendicular to B. (Because B is azimuthal, a plane with its normal along the radial direction is suitable. A more practical arrangement is to make the loop very small and place it so that one part of it is near the point P where you want to measure the field.)\n\n• Connect the two ends of the loop to a sensitive, high–impedance oscilloscope. A high impedance is needed so that the loop load does not significantly disturb the field.\n\nFor such a loop, the magnetic flux is approximately\n\n  Φ_B(t) = B(r,t)·A_l,\n   where A_l is the area of the pickup loop.\n\nSince B is oscillatory (with time dependence cos ωt), the time–varying flux induces an emf in the coil by Faraday’s law:\n\n  ε = – dΦ_B/dt ≈ – A_l dB/dt.\n\nTaking the time derivative of B we find\n\n  dB/dt = – (μ₀ ε₀ V₀ ω² r sin ωt)/(2d).\n\nThus the induced emf is\n\n  ε(t) = A_l (μ₀ ε₀ V₀ ω² r sin ωt)/(2d).\n\nFor an order–of–magnitude estimation, suppose that:\n  • A_l ~ 1×10^(–4) m² (a loop of radius about 1 cm),\n  • r ~ 0.01 m,\n  • d ~ 1×10^(–3) m,\n  • V₀ ~ 100 V,\n  • ω ~ 10^5 rad/s.\n\nNotice that μ₀ε₀ = 1/c² ≈ 1.11×10^(–17) (in SI units). Then the amplitude of B from (a) is roughly\n\n  B₀ ~ (1.11×10^(–17)×100×10^5×0.01)/(2×10^(–3))\n    ≈ (1.11×10^(–17)×10^7)/(2×10^(–3))\n    ≈ (1.11×10^(–10))/(2×10^(–3))\n    ≈ 5.55×10^(–8) T  [Note: In our first pass one might obtain a very small field.]\n\nAnd the amplitude of the induced emf in the coil will be\n\n  ε₀ ~ (A_l μ₀ ε₀ V₀ ω² r)/(2d)\n    ≈ (1×10^(–4) × 1.11×10^(–17) × 100 × (10^5)² × 0.01)/(2×10^(–3)).\n\nWorking this out roughly:\n  (10^5)² = 10^10, so numerator ≈ 1×10^(–4) × 1.11×10^(–17) × 100 × 10^10 × 0.01\n    ≈ (1.11×100×0.01)×(10^(–4 –17+10))\n    ≈ (1.11)×10^(–11).\nDivide by 2×10^(–3) to get\n  ε₀ ~ 0.55×10^(–8) V,\nthat is, on the order of a few nanovolts.\n\nThus the expected signal is extremely small – only a few nanovolts amplitude. In practice great care (and excellent shielding and noise reduction) is needed to measure such a signal.\n\nA sketch of the experimental arrangement would show:\n  1. The parallel-plate capacitor with circular plates.\n  2. A small pickup loop (with area A_l) placed between the plates, with its plane arranged perpendicular to the local magnetic field (so its edge is tangent to the circles of B).\n  3. The pickup loop leads connecting to the high impedance oscilloscope.\n\n────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The magnetic field at a point P at distance r (with r < R) from the axis is\n  B(r,t) = (μ₀ ε₀ V₀ ω r cos ωt)/(2d)\nand it is directed tangentially (azimuthally) around the capacitor’s axis.\n\n(b) One may detect this field by inserting a small pickup (wire) loop into the gap between the plates. With the loop’s plane oriented so that it intercepts the flux from the tangential B (that is, the loop’s normal lies radially), the induced emf in the loop is\n  ε(t) = (A_l μ₀ ε₀ V₀ ω² r sin ωt)/(2d).\nFor typical parameters (for example, A_l ~ 10^(–4) m², r ~ 0.01 m, d ~ 10^(–3) m, V₀ ~ 100 V, ω ~ 10^5 rad/s) the signal is only a few nanovolts.\n\n────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer in Latex Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad B(r,t) & = \\frac{\\mu_0\\epsilon_0\\,V_0\\,\\omega\\,r\\,\\cos \\omega t}{2\\,d},\\quad (r<R),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\text{A small pickup loop of area } A_l\\text{ (placed with its plane normal to the local }B\\text{ field)}\\\\[1mm]\n& \\text{will have an induced emf } \\varepsilon(t) = \\frac{A_l\\,\\mu_0\\epsilon_0\\,V_0\\,\\omega^2\\,r\\,\\sin \\omega t}{2\\,d}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{For typical parameters, } \\varepsilon(t)&\\sim\\text{ a few nanovolts.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad B(r,t) & = \\frac{\\mu_0\\epsilon_0\\,V_0\\,\\omega\\,r\\,\\cos \\omega t}{2\\,d},\\quad (r<R),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\text{A small pickup loop of area } A_l\\text{ (placed with its plane normal to the local }B\\text{ field)}\\\\[1mm]\n& \\text{will have an induced emf } \\varepsilon(t) = \\frac{A_l\\,\\mu_0\\epsilon_0\\,V_0\\,\\omega^2\\,r\\,\\sin \\omega t}{2\\,d}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{For typical parameters, } \\varepsilon(t)&\\sim\\text{ a few nanovolts.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad B(r,t) & = \\frac{\\mu_0\\epsilon_0\\,V_0\\,\\omega\\,r\\,\\cos \\omega t}{2\\,d},\\quad (r<R),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\text{A small pickup loop of area } A_l\\text{ (placed with its plane normal to the local }B\\text{ field)}\\\\[1mm]\n& \\text{will have an induced emf } \\varepsilon(t) = \\frac{A_l\\,\\mu_0\\epsilon_0\\,V_0\\,\\omega^2\\,r\\,\\sin \\omega t}{2\\,d}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{For typical parameters, } \\varepsilon(t)&\\sim\\text{ a few nanovolts.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{B}(r, t) = \\frac{\\varepsilon_0 \\mu_0 V_0 \\omega r}{2d} \\cos (\\omega t) \\mathbf{e}_{\\theta}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

(There are no other free charges anywhere.) Thus the potential must satisfy Poisson’s equation in the interior (with a singular source at r = 0) and Laplace’s equation in the exterior (where there is no free charge).\n\nA standard procedure is to “split off” the known charge‐term and then add a solution of Laplace’s equation (harmonic function) chosen so that the boundary condition is met. In other words, write\n\n  Φ = φ_q + φ^h\n\nwith\n  φ_q(r) = q/(4πε₀ r)  (the usual Coulomb potential)\nand φ^h is harmonic (Δφ^h = 0) everywhere.\n\nBecause of azimuthal symmetry (the only angular dependence is in θ) we expand φ^h in Legendre polynomials.

Now note that the Coulomb potential is spherically symmetric (it is essentially an l = 0 term) so that when we evaluate it at r = R we get a constant term\n  q/(4πε₀ R)\nwhich does not have any cosθ–dependence.

In full generality we write\n\n  Φ_out(r,θ) = q/(4πε₀ r) + ∑ₗ B_ℓ r^(–ℓ–1) P_ℓ(cosθ).\n\nIn order to “match” at r = R to the boundary condition we require\n\n  Φ_out(R,θ) = q/(4πε₀ R) + ∑ₗ B_ℓ R^(–ℓ–1) P_ℓ(cosθ) = V₀ cosθ.\n\nAgain, because the right–hand side has only an l = 1 dependence we must have:\n\n• l = 0: q/(4πε₀ R) + B₀ R^(–1) = 0 → B₀ = –q/(4πε₀)\n• l = 1: B₁ R^(–2) = V₀      → B₁ = V₀ R²\n• l ≥ 2: B_ℓ = 0.\n\nThus the exterior solution becomes\n\n  Φ_out(r,θ) = q/(4πε₀ r) – [q/(4πε₀)] 1/r + (V₀R²)/r² cosθ.\n\nBut notice that\n  q/(4πε₀ r) – [q/(4πε₀)]/r = 0.\nThat is, the l = 0 piece cancels completely. Hence we have\n\n  Φ_out(r,θ) = V₀ (R²/r²) cosθ.\n                            (2)\n\nA short check: At r = R we have\n  Φ_out(R,θ) = V₀ (R²/R²) cosθ = V₀ cosθ,\nin agreement with the given boundary condition.\n\nAlso note that as r → ∞ the potential decays as 1/r². (That is, the exterior field “sees” a net zero charge because the induced surface charge on the spherical surface cancels the charge q – a common situation when a point charge is placed inside an “externally–controlled” potential.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Comments on the Result\n\nIt is worth stressing that the “extra” terms (the homogeneous solutions added to q/(4πε₀ r)) have been chosen precisely to cancel the “wrong” (monopole) piece that the Coulomb potential would have produced on the spherical surface and to supply the desired dipole (l = 1) variation V₀ cosθ. (In many texts the procedure is presented as an expansion in Legendre polynomials.) One may easily check that the inside solution (1) and the outside solution (2) match continuously at r = R.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThus one acceptable answer is\n\n  For r < R:\n    Φ_in(r,θ) = q/(4πε₀ r) – [q/(4πε₀ R)] + (V₀/R) r cosθ\n\n  For r > R:\n    Φ_out(r,θ) = V₀ (R²/r²) cosθ\n\nWe now box this final answer in LaTeX:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Phi_{\\text{in}}(r,\\theta) &= \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,r} - \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,R} + \\frac{V_0}{R}\\,r\\cos\\theta,\\quad r<R,\\\\[1mm]\n\\Phi_{\\text{out}}(r,\\theta) &= \\frac{V_0\\,R^2}{r^2}\\cos\\theta,\\quad r>R.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nAny answer equivalent to the one above is correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\Phi_{\\text{in}}(r,\\theta) &= \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,r} - \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,R} + \\frac{V_0}{R}\\,r\\cos\\theta,\\quad r<R,\\\\[1mm]\n\\Phi_{\\text{out}}(r,\\theta) &= \\frac{V_0\\,R^2}{r^2}\\cos\\theta,\\quad r>R.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\Phi_{\\text{in}}(r,\\theta) &= \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,r} - \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,R} + \\frac{V_0}{R}\\,r\\cos\\theta,\\quad r<R,\\\\[1mm]\n\\Phi_{\\text{out}}(r,\\theta) &= \\frac{V_0\\,R^2}{r^2}\\cos\\theta,\\quad r>R.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\Phi_- = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r} - \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 R} + \\frac{V_0 \\cos \\theta}{R} r"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\Phi_{\\text{in}}(r,\\theta) &= \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,r} - \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,R} + \\frac{V_0}{R}\\,r\\cos\\theta,\\quad r<R,\\\\[1mm]\n\\Phi_{\\text{out}}(r,\\theta) &= \\frac{V_0\\,R^2}{r^2}\\cos\\theta,\\quad r>R.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\Phi_+ = \\frac{V_0 R^2}{r^2} \\cos \\theta"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "electro/1_69", "solution": "We wish to find the potential everywhere when a conducting sphere of radius a that carries a net charge q is placed in a uniform external electric field E₀ (taken along the z‐axis). In addition, we want the induced dipole moment and a discussion of the different energy “pieces” that arise when one writes the energy as an integral of the square of the total electric field.\n\nBelow we describe one acceptable solution step‐by‐step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Finding the potential\n\nBecause the sphere is a conductor the potential on its surface must be constant. (We assume that the sphere’s charge resides on its surface.) In the absence of any external field the potential is simply (for r ≥ a)\n  V_monopole = q/(4πε₀r),\nand inside the sphere (r ≤ a) the potential is constant:\n  V_inside = q/(4πε₀a).\n\nNow, when the uniform field E₀ is “switched on” there would in isolation be a potential\n  V_ext = –E₀z = –E₀r cos θ.\nBut if we added –E₀r cos θ to the monopole potential, the resulting potential would not be constant on r = a. Thus we must “correct” it by adding a solution of Laplace’s equation (namely, a dipole term) so that the boundary condition on the sphere’s surface is met.\n\nA trial solution (for r ≥ a) is to write\n  V_out(r,θ) = A₀/r + B r cos θ + C cos θ /r².\nAs usual, we require that the total potential coincide with the externally “imposed” field at infinity. In the limit r → ∞ only the term B r cos θ survives and we must have\n  B = –E₀.\nNext, the sphere’s surface (r = a) must be an equipotential (with no θ–dependence). That is, we require that \n  V_out(a,θ) = A₀/a – E₀a cos θ + C cos θ/a²\nbe independent of θ. This can only happen if the cos θ–term cancels. Hence,\n  –E₀a + C/a² = 0 ⟹ C = E₀ a³.\nFinally, the net “monopole” part must reproduce the original charge q. That is, we must have A₀ = q/(4πε₀) so that\n  V_monopole = q/(4πε₀r).\nThus the final answer for r ≥ a is\n  V_out(r,θ) = (q/(4πε₀ r)) – E₀ r cos θ + (E₀ a³ cos θ)/(r²).\n\nSince the conductor is an equipotential, the potential inside the sphere is just the value on its surface:\n  V_in(r,θ) = V_out(a,θ) = q/(4πε₀ a).\n(To within an arbitrary additive constant; here we have chosen the constant so that at infinity the uniform field has V → –E₀ r cos θ.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. The induced dipole moment\n\nThe extra term (E₀a³ cosθ/r²) is exactly the potential due to a dipole located at the origin. Recall that the potential due to a dipole of moment p is\n  V_dip(r,θ) = (p cosθ)/(4πε₀ r²).\nThus, equating\n  (E₀ a³ cosθ)/(r²) = (p cosθ)/(4πε₀ r²)\nwe deduce\n  p = 4πε₀ a³ E₀.\nNote that the net (or “total”) dipole moment on the sphere is just that induced by the applied field because the monopole (charge q) has no dipole moment when centered.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. The six energy terms\n\nRecall that the (electrostatic) energy in a region is given by\n  U = (ε₀/2) ∫ |E_total|² dV,\nwhere\n  E_total = E_q + E₀ + E_dip.\nHere:\n• E_q is the field due to the monopole (charge q on the sphere);\n• E₀ is the uniform external field;\n• E_dip is the dipole field due to the induced surface charges.\n\nWhen one squares the total field one obtains six terms:\n  |E_total|² = E_q² + E₀² + E_dip² + 2 E_q·E₀ + 2 E_q·E_dip + 2 E₀·E_dip.\nLet us discuss each term:\n\n1. (E_q)². \n  This is the self–energy of the charged sphere (with its charge q spread on its surface). For a finite sphere this energy is finite (indeed, it is known to be U_q = q²/(8πε₀ a) for a uniformly charged conductor).\n\n2. (E₀)².\n  This is the energy that would be stored in the uniform external field. When integrated over all space this term is unbounded (infinite) because the uniform field fills all space.\n\n3. (E_dip)².\n  This is the self–energy of the induced dipole field. Since a dipole field decays as 1/r³, the corresponding energy density (∼ 1/r⁶) is integrable and the result is finite.\n\n4. 2E_q·E₀.\n  Since E_q is spherically symmetric and E₀ is a uniform field (say, along z) the angular integration causes this cross–term to vanish. (It is the interaction between a centered monopole and a uniform field.)\n\n5. 2E_q·E_dip.\n  Similarly, because the dipole field induced on the sphere is exactly what is required to “restore” the constant potential on its surface (and it is centered) the cross–term between the monopole field and the dipole field vanishes upon integration.\n\n6. 2E₀·E_dip.\n  This is the interaction between the uniform field and the induced dipole.

{"id": "electro/1_56", "solution": "We begin by noting that when a dielectric sphere (with radius R and relative permittivity\n\n  Kₑ = ε/ε₀)\n\nis placed in a uniform applied field E₀ (as in a very large parallel‐plate capacitor), the field inside the sphere is uniform. In fact, one can show (by solving Laplace’s equation with the appropriate boundary conditions) that the field inside, E_in, is\n\n  E_in = (3/(Kₑ+2)) E₀.\n\nBecause the sphere becomes uniformly polarized, the outside potential is given by the superposition of the applied field and the field of an induced dipole. In particular, the potential in the region outside the sphere (r ≥ R) may be written in spherical coordinates (r, θ) as\n\n  V_out(r,θ) = –E₀ r cosθ + A (cosθ)/r² ,  (1)\n\nwith A a constant determined by the boundary conditions on the sphere’s surface. (Here, the z–axis is taken along the direction of the applied field.) The boundary conditions involve the continuity of the potential and of the normal component of the displacement field D. Matching conditions at r = R leads to\n\n  A = E₀ R³ (Kₑ – 1)/(Kₑ + 2).\n\nThus the potential outside is\n\n  V_out(r,θ) = –E₀ r cosθ + [E₀ R³ (Kₑ–1)/(Kₑ+2)] (cosθ)/r².\n\nWe now wish to find the electric field at a point p on the sphere’s outer surface, i.e. at r = R. The electric field is given by\n\n  E = –∇V.\n\nIt is easiest to compute the gradient in spherical coordinates. Recall that for a potential V(r,θ) (with no φ–dependence) the gradient is\n  \n  E = –(∂V/∂r) e_r – (1/r)(∂V/∂θ) e_θ.\n\nStep 1. Compute ∂V_out/∂r:\n\nWrite V_out in the form\n  V_out(r,θ) = –E₀ r cosθ + A (cosθ)/r²  with A = E₀ R³ (Kₑ – 1)/(Kₑ+2).\n\nDifferentiate with respect to r:\n  ∂V_out/∂r = –E₀ cosθ – A (–2 cosθ)/r³ = –E₀ cosθ + (2A cosθ)/r³.\n\nThus at r = R,\n  (∂V_out/∂r)₍r=R₎ = –E₀ cosθ + (2A cosθ)/R³\n    = –E₀ cosθ + 2E₀ (Kₑ – 1)/(Kₑ+2) cosθ\n    = –E₀ cosθ [1 – 2 (Kₑ – 1)/(Kₑ+2)].\n\nBut we can also factor this expression more conveniently later when we combine with the other component.\n\nStep 2. Compute ∂V_out/∂θ:\n\nDifferentiate V_out with respect to θ:\n  ∂V_out/∂θ = E₀ r sinθ – A (sinθ)/r².\n\nThus at r = R,\n  (∂V_out/∂θ)₍r=R₎ = E₀ R sinθ – A (sinθ)/R²\n    = E₀ R sinθ – E₀ R (Kₑ – 1)/(Kₑ+2) sinθ\n    = E₀ R sinθ [1 – (Kₑ – 1)/(Kₑ+2)].\n\nNow, simplify the bracket:\n  1 – (Kₑ – 1)/(Kₑ+2) = [(Kₑ+2) – (Kₑ – 1)]/(Kₑ+2) = (3)/(Kₑ+2).\n\nThus,\n  (∂V_out/∂θ)₍r=R₎ = (3E₀R sinθ)/(Kₑ+2).\n\nStep 3.

Bound Surface Charge Density\n\nThe dielectric sphere is uniformly polarized inside. Its polarization is given by\n  P = ε₀χₑ E_in,\nwith electric susceptibility χₑ = Kₑ – 1 and E_in = (3E₀)/(Kₑ+2) (in the z–direction). Thus,\n  P = ε₀ (Kₑ–1) (3E₀/(Kₑ+2)) ẑ.\n\nOn the surface of the sphere the bound surface charge density is given by:\n  σ_b = P ⋅ n̂,\nwhere n̂ is the outward normal. For a sphere, n̂ = e_r. Since ẑ⋅e_r = cosθ, we have\n  σ_b = P cosθ = ε₀ (Kₑ–1) (3E₀/(Kₑ+2)) cosθ.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\nThus, the electric field at a point p on the surface (r = R, polar angle θ) is\n\n  E(R,θ) = [3E₀/(Kₑ+2)] [Kₑ cosθ e_r – sinθ e_θ],\n\nand the bound surface charge density is\n\n  σ_b(R,θ) = [3ε₀ (Kₑ–1)E₀/(Kₑ+2)] cosθ.\n\nWe now present the final answer in Latex boxed format:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\vec{E}(R,\\theta) &= \\frac{3E_0}{K_e+2}\\left[K_e\\cos\\theta\\,\\hat{r}-\\sin\\theta\\,\\hat{\\theta}\\right],\\\\[1mm]\n\\sigma_b(R,\\theta) &= \\frac{3\\epsilon_0\\,(K_e-1)E_0}{K_e+2}\\cos\\theta.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\vec{E}(R,\\theta) &= \\frac{3E_0}{K_e+2}\\left[K_e\\cos\\theta\\,\\hat{r}-\\sin\\theta\\,\\hat{\\theta}\\right],\\\\[1mm]\n\\sigma_b(R,\\theta) &= \\frac{3\\epsilon_0\\,(K_e-1)E_0}{K_e+2}\\cos\\theta.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\vec{E}(R,\\theta) &= \\frac{3E_0}{K_e+2}\\left[K_e\\cos\\theta\\,\\hat{r}-\\sin\\theta\\,\\hat{\\theta}\\right],\\\\[1mm]\n\\sigma_b(R,\\theta) &= \\frac{3\\epsilon_0\\,(K_e-1)E_0}{K_e+2}\\cos\\theta.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "E = K_e E_0 \\cos \\theta \\, e_r - E_0 \\sin \\theta \\, e_\\theta"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "3*E*epsilon(K - 1)*cos(theta)/(K + 2)", "expr2": "E*(K*cos(e*theta) - sin(a*e**2*h*t*theta))"}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "electro/1_32", "solution": "We will show that if a very long (i.e., “infinite‐length”) hollow metallic cylinder (a “tube”) of inner radius r₀ and outer radius r₀+Δr (with Δr ≪ r₀) is “infused” with a fixed uniform space–charge density ρ₀ (that is, the metal “contains” extra fixed positive charge, say) then, since the metal is a conductor, free electrons will rearrange so that the electric field in the metallic region vanishes. (In other words, the extra free charges “induce” surface charges on the boundaries so that the net field in the metal is zero.) In one case we assume that no charge may leave the metal so that the “net charge of the cylinder is zero” (the induced surface charges exactly cancel the fixed bulk charge) while in the second case the metal is connected to ground (so that its potential is forced to vanish).\n\nBelow we describe one acceptable solution. (Any answer equivalent to the answer given here is correct.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. The physical picture\n\nInside the metal (r₀ < r < r₀+Δr) there is a fixed space–charge density ρ₀. Were the metal not able to rearrange free charges, the volume charge would produce a nonzero electric field in the metal. But because the metal is conducting, free charges quickly move so that the total (net) electric field vanishes throughout the bulk.\n\nThis “shielding” is achieved by inducing a surface charge density σ₍inner₎ on the inner surface (r = r₀) and a surface charge density σ₍outer₎ on the outer surface (r = r₀+Δr). (See figure in your mind.) When the conductor is isolated the net charge on the metal remains zero, so that\n  Q_bulk + Q_inner + Q_outer = 0.\nWhen the conductor is grounded the conductor is maintained at zero potential, and extra charge may flow to/from earth if necessary – however, as we shall see (to first order in Δr/r₀) the cancellation is essentially the same.\n\nBecause we assume an infinite cylinder the problem is “two–dimensional” (i.e. independent of z) and the only coordinate is the radial coordinate r.\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. The “would–be” fields if there were no free rearrangement\n\nIf the fixed positive charge density ρ₀ were spread uniformly in an annulus (r₀ ≤ r ≤ r₀+Δr) then using Gauss’s law a “test” cylindrical surface of radius r (and length L) would enclose (if r > r₀+Δr)\n  Q_vol = ρ₀ × (volume) = ρ₀ L π[(r₀+Δr)² – r₀²].\nIn our limit Δr ≪ r₀ we may approximate\n  (r₀+Δr)² – r₀² ≈ 2r₀ Δr.\nThus one would have a “line–charge” per unit length (along z)\n  λ_bulk = (ρ₀)(2π r₀ Δr)\nif nothing canceled it. (In an infinite charge distribution the field outside would be given by E = λ⁄(2πε₀r).)\n\nHowever, since the conductor enforces E = 0 within its bulk the free electrons must move so as to cancel the field due to the volume charge.\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Zero field in the metal and determination of σ₍inner₎\n\nLet us “imagine” a Gaussian cylinder of radius r with r chosen inside the metal so that\n  r₀ < r < r₀+Δr.\nBecause the metal is a conductor we require that the net E field there vanish. (Also, the field produced by any charge on surfaces lying outside (r > r) does not enter the Gauss law “enclosed–charge” calculation for r.)\nFor r in [r₀, r₀+Δr] the only sources inside (i.e. with r′ < r) are\n\n1. the fixed volume charge in the annular region from r = r₀ to r, whose total charge is\n  Q_vol(r) = ρ₀ L π (r² – r₀²),\n2. and (if r > r₀) the inner surface charge Q_inner = (charge per unit length) = 2π r₀ L σ₍inner₎ (since the entire inner surface is at r = r₀).\n\nFor a cylindrical Gaussian surface, Gauss’s law tells us\n  E(r) · (2π r L) = Q_enclosed/ε₀.\nSince we want E(r) = 0 for every r in the metal, we must have Q_enclosed = 0. (Although one cannot “cancel” a function of r for all r by a single constant, in the “thin–shell” limit we require that the cancellation take place to lowest order in Δr. One acceptable procedure is to require that the field vanish at, say, r = r₀+Δr. Then we have\n  Q_vol(r₀+Δr) + Q_inner = 0.\nThat is,\n  ρ₀ L π[(r₀+Δr)² – r₀²] + 2π r₀ L σ₍inner₎ = 0.\nUsing (r₀+Δr)² – r₀² ≈ 2r₀ Δr we get\n  ρ₀ L π (2r₀ Δr) + 2π r₀ L σ₍inner₎ = 0.\nDivide by 2πr₀ L:\n  ρ₀ Δr + σ₍inner₎ = 0  ⟹  σ₍inner₎ = –ρ₀ Δr.\n)\n\nThus, to first order in Δr/r₀ the induced charge per unit area on the inner wall is\n  σ₍inner₎ = –ρ₀ Δr.\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. The outer surface charge\n\nFor an isolated conductor we have assumed that the net charge is zero. (The fixed volume charge in the metal is Q_bulk = ρ₀ L π[(r₀+Δr)² – r₀²] which, again, for Δr ≪ r₀ is ρ₀ L 2π r₀ Δr.) Hence the charge induced on the outer surface, Q_outer, is found from\n  Q_bulk + Q_inner + Q_outer = 0.\nSince\n  Q_inner = 2π r₀ L (–ρ₀ Δr) = –ρ₀ L 2π r₀ Δr,\nwe have\n  ρ₀ L 2πr₀ Δr – ρ₀ L 2πr₀ Δr + Q_outer = 0  ⟹  Q_outer = 0.\nThus, for the isolated (net–neutral) cylinder the outer surface acquires (to lowest order) no net charge; that is, \n  σ₍outer₎ = 0.\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 5. What then are the fields?\n\nNow that we know the “sources,” we may “piece together” the answer for the three regions.\n\na) For r < r₀ (inside the hollow “cavity”):\n If we choose a Gaussian cylinder of radius r < r₀, it encloses no charge (the inner surface is at r = r₀ and is not enclosed). By symmetry (or by the uniqueness theorem – the solution of Laplace’s equation with constant potential inside a conductor is unique) the electric field is\n  E = 0.\n (This is the well–known result that the interior of a closed conductor is “shielded” from external charges.)\n\nb) For r₀ < r < r₀+Δr (inside the metal):\n By the definition of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium we must have\n  E = 0.\n (That is what “free charge rearrangement” has achieved.)\n\nc) For r > r₀+Δr (outside the cylinder):\n Now take a Gaussian cylinder of radius r > r₀+Δr. It encloses the following charges:\n  – The fixed volume charge: Q_bulk = ρ₀ L π[(r₀+Δr)² – r₀²] ≈ ρ₀ L 2πr₀ Δr.\n  – The inner surface charge: Q_inner = –ρ₀ L 2πr₀ Δr.\n  – The outer surface charge: Q_outer = 0.\n Thus the total enclosed charge is zero. Hence by Gauss’s law\n  E·(2π r L) = 0  ⟹  E = 0.\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 6. Summary for the (net‐neutral, isolated) cylinder\n\nFor the “isolated” (net–neutral) metallic cylinder we have found that:\n – The induced surface charge densities are\n  σ₍inner₎ = –ρ₀ Δr  and  σ₍outer₎ = 0.\n – The resulting electric field is zero in all regions:\n  • For r < r₀, inside the cavity, E = 0.\n  • For r₀ < r < r₀+Δr (in the metal), E = 0.\n  • For r > r₀+Δr, outside the cylinder, E = 0.\nThus the free charges have exactly “cancelled” the field due to the fixed positive space–charge.\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 7. The “grounded” case\n\nWhen the cylinder is connected to ground the potential of the metal is fixed (say, to 0). In a conductor the condition E = 0 in the body always holds regardless of the absolute value of the potential. (In the isolated case the potential would be “floating” at some constant value.) In the grounded case the free electrons (which are allowed to flow to or from earth) will rearrange themselves so that not only is the field in the metal zero but also the (common) potential of the cavity and the metal is 0.\n\nA similar analysis in the metal (using a Gaussian cylinder in r₀ < r < r₀+Δr) again forces\n  σ₍inner₎ = –ρ₀ Δr.\nFurthermore, since the “outside” potential is now referenced to earth (taken to be 0 at infinity as well) the condition that the metal stay at zero potential forces the net line–charge of the cylinder (i.e. Q_bulk+Q_inner+Q_outer) to vanish. But as before we already have\n  Q_bulk + Q_inner = ρ₀ L (2πr₀Δr) – ρ₀ L (2πr₀Δr) = 0,\nso that no extra charge need appear on the outer surface. (Any change would be of relative order ~Δr/r₀ and is negligible to first order.) Thus, for the grounded cylinder we also have\n  σ₍outer₎ = 0  and\n  E = 0 everywhere (in the cavity, in the metal, and outside).\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 8. Final Answers\n\nThus one acceptable answer is as follows.\n\n(1) For an isolated metal cylinder (with overall net charge zero):\n\n Electric field:\n  For r < r₀ (inside the cavity):  E = 0.\n  For r₀ < r < r₀+Δr (in the metal):  E = 0.\n  For r > r₀+Δr (outside the cylinder):  E = 0.\n\n Induced surface charge densities:\n  On the inner surface (r = r₀): σ₍inner₎ = –ρ₀ Δr.\n  On the outer surface (r = r₀+Δr): σ₍outer₎ = 0.\n\n(2) For the same cylinder when it is grounded (i.e. held at 0 potential):\n\n The condition that the metal be an equipotential and that E vanish in the metal again forces\n  σ₍inner₎ = –ρ₀ Δr  and (to lowest order)\n  σ₍outer₎ = 0.\n Also, one finds that\n  E = 0 everywhere (for r < r₀, r₀ < r < r₀+Δr, and r > r₀+Δr).\n\nIn other words, whether the net charge of the cylinder is “fixed to zero” (by isolation) or the conductor is grounded, the rearrangement of free charge is such that the extra volume charge (density ρ₀) in the thin metal is exactly cancelled by a charge of –ρ₀ Δr per unit area on the inner wall of the tube; no extra charge appears on the outer surface (to first order) and therefore no field is produced in either the hollow cavity or outside the metal.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l} \n\\text{(a) For an isolated (net–neutral) metallic cylinder:} \\\\[1mm]\n\\quad\\;

{"id": "electro/1_35", "solution": "We wish to know how an isolated, finite conductor that (by some preparation) carries a uniform volume charge density ρ will evolve when it is an ohmic (conducting) medium of conductivity σ. In any conductor the charges will eventually rearrange themselves so that the static equilibrium has no electric field inside the conductor (and hence no current), with all free charges “piled up” on the surface (in general, with a non‐uniform surface distribution if the body is not spherical). However, how that rearrangement (“relaxation”) takes place – and how the stored energy decreases – depends on the geometry.\n\nLet’s analyze the two cases in detail.\n\n─────────────────────────\n1. General Considerations\n\nBecause the conductor is ohmic, the conduction current obeys Ohm’s law (in differential form)\n  J = σE.\nAlong with Gauss’s law and the continuity equation,\n  ∇·J = −∂ρ/∂t,\nthis leads (in what is called the “charge relaxation” problem) to a decay of charges on a time scale of order\n  τ ~ ε/σ,\nwhere ε is the (local) dielectric constant. In many textbooks (for example, when the conductor is “macroscopic” and the fields vary slowly) one finds that the “relaxation time” for a pure monopole perturbation is exactly τ = ε/σ.\n\nHowever, the particular way in which the charge distribution “decays” – i.e. how the various parts of the initially “non‐equilibrium” charge density rearrange – depends on the symmetry of the body. In all cases the energy initially stored in the electric fields is reduced, with the difference being dissipated via Joule heating (and perhaps even radiation if the time–variation of the current is sufficiently rapid, although that is usually negligible in the quasi–static limit).\n\n─────────────────────────\n2. (a) The Spherical Conductor\n\nImagine a finite, perfectly conducting sphere (radius R) in which, by some means, the free charge is uniformly distributed throughout the volume. (Note that such a condition is not an electrostatic equilibrium; in electrostatics the free charges would reside at the surface so that the interior E‐field would vanish.) Because the sphere is symmetric, the solution of Maxwell’s equations – namely, of the Laplace/Poisson problem – must also be spherically symmetric.\n\nThus, the electric field inside the sphere will be purely radial. (Recall that for a uniformly charged sphere one finds E(r) ∝ r if the charge were “frozen” in and not allowed to move.) But here the field drives a conduction current given by\n\n  J(r,t) = σE(r,t).\n\nSince the symmetry is perfect, there is no source of any multipole moment besides the uniform (monopole) one. In fact one may show that the charge density decays exponentially in time according to\n\n  ρ(t) = ρ(0) e^(–t/τ)\n  with τ = ε/σ.\nLikewise, the interior electric field decays as E(t) = E(0) e^(–t/τ).\n\nThe final state is reached when the interior field has died away and all remaining net charge has been driven to the surface where it arranges itself uniformly (because of the symmetry) so as to produce a vanishingly small electric field inside. The energy originally stored in the “volume‐distributed” field is partly “lost” in the sense that the final (electrostatic) energy stored in the surface–charge configuration is lower. The energy difference\n\n  ΔU = U_initial − U_final\n\nhas been converted into heat (Joule dissipation) in the conductor during the rearrangement.\n\n─────────────────────────\n3. (b) The Non–Spherical Conductor\n\nNow suppose that the conductor has a shape which is not spherically symmetric. Although we again begin with a uniform charge density ρ in the volume, the geometry no longer “forces” the field lines to be radial, and the “equipotential” surfaces in the conductor are not simply concentric spheres. In a conductor at static equilibrium the electric potential must be constant throughout the interior. (Recall that if there were any potential differences there would be currents, by Ohm’s law.) In a non–spherical object the only possible static charge distribution that leads to no interior electric fields is one in which the charges have moved to the surface and distributed themselves non–uniformly (in a way that depends on the geometry) so that the entire interior is at the same potential.\n\nAs a consequence, the initial uniform volume charge density must “decompose” into its various multipole components. Although the overall (monopole) charge is still conserved and its associated “mode” decays with the same time constant τ = ε/σ, the non–monopolar (multipole) parts of the distribution (for example, dipole, quadrupole, etc.) are not “natural” modes of the final equilibrium state and they decay much faster (with rates determined by the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator in the given geometry). In other words, the evolution generally proceeds in two stages:\n (a) A rapid “smoothing” stage during which the non–monopole (higher–order) parts are rapidly dissipated by internal currents.\n (b) A slower decay of the remaining uniform (monopole) component with time constant τ = ε/σ.\n\nThe result is that during the relaxation of a non–spherical conductor the local currents and fields are more complex, and the initial “excess” energy is partly dissipated more quickly as Joule heat associated with the rapid decay of the higher multipole moments. In the final state the free charges have reached the surface and are arranged in a non–uniform way (because, for a non–spherical conductor, the equilibrium surface charge density is in general non–uniform) so that the interior remains an equipotential. Again, the difference between the initial energy stored in the volume distribution and the final (lower) electrostatic energy is dissipated as heat.\n\n─────────────────────────\n4. Summary of the Energy Evolution\n\nIn both cases the eventual equilibrium is one in which the interior of the conductor is field–free and the net charge resides on the surface. However, in the spherical case the special symmetry forces the decay to occur in a “single” mode with all quantities decaying exponentially with the relaxation time τ = ε/σ. In the non–spherical case the initial uniform density “contains” non–equilibrium multipole components that decay on faster time scales (with the monopole decaying as e^(–t/τ) only after the higher modes have been quickly “washed out”). In both cases the energy difference between the initial electric field energy and the final (lower) equilibrium energy is dissipated as Joule heating in the conductor (and, in principle, there may be some “loss” to radiation if the transients are sufficiently rapid).\n\n─────────────────────────\n5.

{"id": "electro/3_2", "solution": "We wish to show that the two‐terminal network in Fig. 3.3 behaves exactly like an ideal battery with emf ε₀ and internal resistance r. (Any network that has a linear current–voltage relation is equivalent to a battery in series with an internal resistance.) For an ideal battery with emf ε₀ and internal resistance r the voltage V across its terminals (when supplying a current I to a load) is given by\n\n  V = ε₀ – I·r.      (1)\n\nThus the corresponding current–voltage relation is\n\n  I = (ε₀ – V)/r.      (2)\n\nLet us now discuss how the three quantities that are usually determined experimentally from a current–voltage plot are related to these parameters.\n\nStep 1. Open‐Circuit Voltage (ε₀):\n\nIf no load is connected then the output current is zero (I = 0), and from (1) we obtain\n\n  V_oc = ε₀ – (0)·r = ε₀.\n\nThus, the open-circuit voltage measured at terminals A–B is just ε₀.\n\nStep 2. Internal Resistance (r):\n\nIf one plots the terminal current I versus the terminal voltage V the data will lie on a straight line. In fact, rewriting (1) in the form\n\n  I = –(1/r) V + (ε₀/r),\n\nwe see that the slope (with respect to V) is –1/r. Hence, if one can measure the slope of the I–V plot then the internal resistance is given by\n\n  r = –(dV/dI).      (3)\n\n(Here, dV/dI is negative since increasing current decreases the terminal voltage.)\n\nStep 3. Short-Circuit Current (I_sc):\n\nNow, if the output terminals are shorted (that is V = 0) then (1) becomes\n\n  I_sc = ε₀ – I_sc·r       [but be careful: with a short V = 0, (1) directly gives]\n  0 = ε₀ – I_sc·r   ⟹ I_sc = ε₀/r.\n\nThus, the short‐circuit current is just the emf divided by the internal resistance.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nIn an experiment one may measure the open-circuit voltage V_oc (which is just ε₀) and in a separate measurement, for example by attaching a variable resistor, determine the slope of the straight line in the current–voltage characteristic.

{"id": "electro/1_68", "solution": "We wish to find a solution for the potential in the empty space (both interior and exterior to a spherical shell of radius a) when the potential on the surface is given by a function that depends only on the polar angle, V(θ). (In our example “(b)” we take V(θ)=V₀cos²θ.) Since there are no charges except (possibly) on the shell, the potential satisfies Laplace’s equation everywhere except on the surface. (Of course all coefficients in what follows depend on the radius a, which we take as fixed.)\n\nBelow we describe how to solve the problem in two parts.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. The General Expansion and Boundary Conditions\n\nInside and outside the sphere the general solution to Laplace’s equation (in spherical coordinates and azimuthal symmetry) is given by\n\n  For r < a (inside):\n    V_in(r,θ) = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ AₙrⁿPₙ(cosθ)\n\n  For r > a (outside):\n    V_out(r,θ) = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ Bₙ r^(–(n+1))Pₙ(cosθ).\n\nThese forms are chosen so that the interior solution is regular at r = 0 and the exterior solution vanishes at infinity.\n\nThe boundary conditions are\n\n1. Continuity of the potential at r = a:\n  V_in(a,θ) = V_out(a,θ) = V(θ).\n\n2. The discontinuity in the radial derivative at r = a is related (via Gauss’s law) to the surface charge density, σ(θ). (If there is a surface charge on the shell, then from\n  ε₀(∂V_in/∂r|₍r=a⁻₎ – ∂V_out/∂r|₍r=a⁺₎) = σ(θ).)\n\nIt is very convenient to expand the given surface potential in Legendre polynomials since these are orthogonal on [0,π]. Writing\n  V(θ) = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ VₙPₙ(cosθ),\nwe obtain for r = a\n\n  Aₙ aⁿ = Bₙ/a^(n+1) = Vₙ      (1)\n\nand with the orthogonality relations,\n  ∫₀π Pₙ(cosθ)P_m(cosθ) sinθ dθ = 0 if n ≠ m,\nand\n  ∫₀π Pₙ²(cosθ) sinθ dθ = 2/(2n+1),\none may show that\n  Aₙ = (2n+1)/(2aⁿ) ∫₀π V(θ)Pₙ(cosθ) sinθ dθ.     (2)\n\nOnce Aₙ is determined, the Bₙ are found via\n  Bₙ = Aₙ a^(2n+1).\n\nThe electric surface sources (if any) are obtained from the jump in dV/dr. To show this, first compute the radial derivatives:\n  ∂V_in/∂r = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ Aₙ n r^(n–1) Pₙ(cosθ),\n  ∂V_out/∂r = –∑ₙ₌₀∞ (n+1) Bₙ r^(–(n+2)) Pₙ(cosθ).\nEvaluating at r = a and subtracting gives\n  [∂V_in/∂r – ∂V_out/∂r]|₍r=a₎ = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ [nAₙ a^(n–1) + (n+1)Bₙ/a^(n+2)]Pₙ(cosθ).\nBut using Bₙ = Aₙ a^(2n+1), we have\n  Bₙ/a^(n+2) = Aₙa^(n–1).\nThus,\n  ∂V_in/∂r – ∂V_out/∂r = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ (2n+1)Aₙ a^(n–1)Pₙ(cosθ).\nThen Gauss’s law (in SI units) shows that\n  σ(θ) = ε₀ ∑ₙ₌₀∞ (2n+1)Aₙ a^(n–1)Pₙ(cosθ).     (3)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. The Specific Case V(θ) = V₀ cos²θ\n\nThe next step is to express cos²θ in an expansion in Legendre polynomials. We recall that\n  P₀(cosθ) = 1,\n  P₁(cosθ) = cosθ,\n  P₂(cosθ) = (3 cos²θ – 1)/2.\nSolve for cos²θ in terms of P₂ and P₀: Write\n  cos²θ = [2P₂(cosθ) + 1] / 3.\nThus we may write\n  V(θ)= V₀cos²θ = (V₀/3)[1 + 2P₂(cosθ)].\nThat is, only the n = 0 and n = 2 terms are nonzero in the expansion. Compare with the general expansion\n  V(θ)= ∑VₙPₙ(cosθ),\nwe see that\n  V₀ = V₀/3  (for n = 0),\n  V₂ = 2V₀/3  (for n = 2),\nand Vₙ = 0 for n ≠ 0,2.\n\nNow, using formula (1) we have for r = a:\n  A₀ a⁰ = V₀/3 ⟹ A₀ = V₀/3,\nand\n  A₂ a² = 2V₀/3 ⟹ A₂ = (2V₀)/(3a²).\n\nIn the exterior region, we have\n  B₀ = A₀ a^(1) = (V₀/3) a,\n  B₂ = A₂ a^(5) = (2V₀/(3a²)) a⁵ = (2V₀/3)a³.\n\nThus, the potential in the two regions is\n\n  For r < a (inside):\n    V_in(r,θ) = A₀ r⁰ P₀(cosθ) + A₂ r² P₂(cosθ)\n             = (V₀/3) + (2V₀/(3a²)) r² · [(3 cos²θ–1)/2]\n             = (V₀/3) + (V₀/(3a²)) r² (3 cos²θ – 1).\n\n  For r > a (outside):\n    V_out(r,θ) = B₀ r^(–1) P₀(cosθ) + B₂ r^(–3) P₂(cosθ)\n             = (V₀a/(3r)) + (2V₀a³/(3r³)) · [(3 cos²θ – 1)/2]\n             = (V₀a/(3r)) + (V₀a³/(3r³))(3 cos²θ – 1).\n\nFinally, the jump in dV/dr at r = a gives the surface charge density. From equation (3) with only n = 0 and 2 contributing we have\n  σ(θ) = ε₀ { (2·0+1) A₀ a^(–1)P₀(cosθ) + (2·2+1) A₂ a^(2–1)P₂(cosθ) }\n      = ε₀ { [1·A₀/a] + [5·A₂ a] P₂(cosθ) }.\nSubstitute A₀ and A₂:\n  A₀/a = (V₀/3)/a = V₀/(3a),\n  5A₂ a = 5 · (2V₀/(3a²)) a = 10V₀/(3a).\nThus,\n  σ(θ) = ε₀ V₀/(3a) [1 + 10P₂(cosθ)].\nIt is often preferable to write the answer in terms of cos²θ. Using\n  P₂(cosθ) = (3 cos²θ – 1)/2,\nwe can also write\n  σ(θ) = ε₀ V₀/(3a) { 1 + 10[(3 cos²θ – 1)/2] } = ε₀ V₀/(3a) [ 1 + 5(3 cos²θ – 1)] = ε₀ V₀/(3a) (15 cos²θ – 4).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThus, one acceptable answer is as follows.\n\n(a) In general the solution is written as\n\n  For r < a:\n    V_in(r,θ) = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ Aₙ rⁿ Pₙ(cosθ),\n  For r > a:\n    V_out(r,θ) = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ Aₙ a^(2n+1) r^(–(n+1)) Pₙ(cosθ),\nwith the coefficients given by\n  Aₙ = (2n+1)/(2aⁿ) ∫₀π V(θ)Pₙ(cosθ) sinθ dθ.\nThe discontinuity in the radial derivative implies that the surface charge density is\n  σ(θ) = ε₀∑ₙ₌₀∞ (2n+1)Aₙ a^(n–1) Pₙ(cosθ).\n\n(b) For V(θ)=V₀cos²θ we use the identity\n  cos²θ = [1 + 2P₂(cosθ)]/3\nso that the only nonzero terms are n = 0 and n = 2. One finds\n  A₀ = V₀/3,  A₂ = 2V₀/(3a²),\nso that\n  V_in(r,θ) = (V₀/3) + (V₀/(3a²))r²(3 cos²θ – 1)  for r < a,\n  V_out(r,θ) = (V₀a/(3r)) + (V₀a³/(3r³))(3 cos²θ – 1)  for r > a,\nand\n  σ(θ) = ε₀V₀/(3a) [1 + 10P₂(cosθ)] = ε₀V₀/(3a)(15cos²θ – 4).\n\nWe now give the final answer in boxed form.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Latex

In particular, if we define the field–strength tensor\n\n  F₍μν₎\n\nthen\n  I₁ = F^(μν)F₍μν₎  and  I₂ = ϵ^(μναβ)F₍μν₎F₍αβ₎\nare invariant under Lorentz transformations.\n\nIf one uses the standard identification of the components (in SI units, with metric signature (1, –– ––)) one finds\n\n  I₁ = 2\\Bigl(B² – E²/c²\\Bigr),\n  I₂ = 4 (E·B).\n\nThus, if in any frame one has\n\n  E·B = 0   and  E² = c²B²,\nthen clearly\n  I₁ = 2\\Bigl(B² – E²/c²\\Bigr) = 0  and  I₂ = 4 (E·B) = 0.\n\nSince I₁ and I₂ are Lorentz invariants, they will vanish in every inertial frame. In other words, if the fields satisfy\n\n  E·B = 0  and  E² = c²B²\nin one frame, they do so in all frames.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (b): Equivalence of K·E = K·B = 0 with n^μF₍μν₎ = 0 \n───────────────────────────── \nIn classical electromagnetism a plane--wave propagating in the direction defined by the unit three–vector K obeys\n\n  K·E = 0  and  K·B = 0.\nThat is, both the electric and magnetic fields are transverse to the direction of propagation.\n\nNow define a four–vector n^μ by\n\n  n^μ = (1, K)   (with |K| = 1).\nNote that n^μ is light–like since\n\n  n^μ n₍μ₎ = 1 – |K|² = 0.\n\nOne may now show that the (four–vector) condition\n\n  n^μF₍μν₎ = 0   (∀ ν)\nis equivalent to the two three–vector conditions. (A brief check follows:)\n\n• For ν = 0, since F₍0i₎ = –Eᵢ (in our sign conventions) one obtains\n  n^μ F₍μ0₎ = n^0 F₍00₎ + n^i F₍i0₎ = 0 + K^i (Eᵢ) = K·E = 0.\n\n• For ν = j (a spatial index), one finds that\n  n^μ F₍μj₎ = n^0 F₍0j₎ + n^i F₍ij₎ = (–E_j) + (–ϵ_{ijk}K^iB^k).\nOne may then show that (using the vector identity for the cross–product) this condition is equivalent to the demand that K is perpendicular to B:\n  K·B = 0.\n\nSince the condition n^μF₍μν₎ = 0 is written in manifestly tensor–covariant form, it is independent of the choice of Lorentz frame. Thus the statements “K·E = 0 and K·B = 0” are Lorentz invariant.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (c): Transformation of a Specific Plane Wave\n───────────────────────────── \nSuppose that in some inertial frame (call it the “laboratory” frame) the only nonzero fields are\n\n  Eₓ = f(ct – z),  cBᵧ = f(ct – z),\nwith f(z) an arbitrary function that vanishes at spatial infinity. (All other components vanish.) Notice that the two Lorentz–invariant conditions are immediately satisfied:\n  E·B = 0  and  E² = c²B².\n\nSince the wave is propagating in the +z–direction (its phase depends on ct – z) we now ask: if we boost with speed v along the z–axis to a new frame S′ (with coordinates t′, x′, y′, z′) what are the fields in S′?\n\nRecall that under a boost in the z–direction, the components of the electric and magnetic fields transform as follows:\n\n  E′ₓ = Eₓ,\n  E′_y = γ (E_y – vBₓ),\n  E′_z = γ (E_z + vBᵧ),\n  B′ₓ = Bₓ,\n  B′_y = γ (Bᵧ + (v/c²)E_z),\n  B′_z = γ (B_z – (v/c²)E_y).\nIn our case, since\n  E = (f(ct – z), 0, 0)  and  B = (0, f(ct – z)/c, 0),\nwe have E_y = E_z = Bₓ = B_z = 0. Hence the transformed fields become\n\n  E′ₓ = f(ct – z),\n  E′_z = γ (0 + vBᵧ) = γ(v/c) f(ct – z),\n  B′_y = γ (Bᵧ + 0) = γ\\frac{f(ct – z)}{c},\nwith all other components zero.\n\nWhat about the argument of the function f? Under the boost along z the coordinates transform as\n  t = γ(t′ + v z′/c²),  z = γ(z′ + vt′).\nThus\n  ct – z = cγ(t′ + v z′/c²) – γ(z′ + vt′)\n      = γ [ct′ + (v/c) z′ – z′ – vt′]\n      = γ (ct′ – z′) (when v and c combine to give the proper Doppler shift factor).\nMore precisely, noting that for a plane wave with phase φ = kμx^μ, the phase is an invariant; writing\n  φ = k(ct – z),\nwith k=(k,0,0,k) (since ω=ck) one finds that in the boosted frame\n  ct – z = γ (1 – v/c)(ct′ – z′).\nThus one may write the answer in the S′–frame as\n\n  E′ₓ = f(γ(1 – v/c)(ct′ – z′)),\n  E′_z = (γv/c) f(γ(1 – v/c)(ct′ – z′)),\n  B′_y = (γ/c) f(γ(1 – v/c)(ct′ – z′)),\nwith all other components equal to zero.\n\nEnergy and momentum densities:\nIn the laboratory frame the electromagnetic energy–density is\n\n  u = ½ ε₀ E² + ½ B²/μ₀.\nSince μ₀ε₀ = 1/c² and here E² = f², B² = f²/c², one easily shows that\n\n  u = ε₀ f².\nThe Poynting vector is\n\n  S = (1/μ₀) E × B.\nIn our case, with\n  E = (f, 0, 0)  and  B = (0, f/c, 0),\none has\n\n  E × B = (0, 0, f²/c).\nThus the momentum density is (S/c²):\n\n  g = (ε₀ f²/c)\\, \\hat z.\nSo the total energy and momentum of the wave (integrated over a large but finite transverse area) are given by\n\n  U = ∫ u d³x  and  P_z = (1/c) U.\nUnder a boost along the z–axis, one finds that the total energy U and total momentum P₋z transform as\n\n  U′ = γ (U – vP_z),  P′_z = γ(P_z – vU/c²).\nThat is, the integrated energy–momentum appears as a four–vector.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer\n───────────────────────────── \n\nThus we have shown that:\n\n(a) The conditions E · B = 0 and E² = c² B² imply that the Lorentz invariants I₁ = 2(B² – E²/c²) and I₂ = 4 E·B vanish, so if they hold in one frame they hold in every frame.\n\n(b) Defining n^μ = (1, K) with K the unit three–vector in the propagation direction, the manifestly Lorentz invariant equation\n\n  n^μ F_{μν} = 0\nis equivalent to the statement that K · E = 0 and K · B = 0.\n\n(c) In a frame in which\n\n  Eₓ = f(ct – z)  and  cBᵧ = f(ct – z),\nthe fields in a frame S′ moving with velocity v in the z–direction are \n  E′ₓ = f(γ(1 – v/c)(ct′ – z′)),\n  E′_z = (γv/c) f(γ(1 – v/c)(ct′ – z′)),\n  B′_y = (γ/c) f(γ(1 – v/c)(ct′ – z′)),\nwith all other components vanishing. Moreover, the energy density u = ε₀ f² and momentum density g = (ε₀ f²/c) transform so that the total energy U and momentum P_z form a four–vector (U, 0, 0, P_z) with\n\n  U′ = γ(U – vP_z)  and  P′_z = γ(P_z – vU/c²).\nThis demonstrates that a “light–wave” in one frame is seen as a light–wave in every Lorentz frame.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer in LaTeX Boxed Format\n───────────────────────────── \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & E\\cdot B=0\\quad \\text{and}\\quad E^2=c^2B^2 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; I_1=2\\Bigl(B^2-\\frac{E^2}{c^2}\\Bigr)=0,\\quad I_2=4(E\\cdot B)=0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{so these conditions, being Lorentz invariant, hold in every frame.}\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{Defining } n^\\mu=(1,\\mathbf{K}),\\; |\\mathbf{K}|=1,\\text{ we have } n^\\mu F_{\\mu\\nu}=0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{which is equivalent to } \\mathbf{K}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}=0 \\text{ and } \\mathbf{K}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}=0,\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{In a frame where } E_x=f(ct-z),\\; cB_y=f(ct-z),\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad E'_x=f\\Bigl(\\gamma(1-\\frac{v}{c})(ct'-z')\\Bigr),\\quad E'_z=\\frac{\\gamma v}{c}f\\Bigl(\\gamma(1-\\frac{v}{c})(ct'-z')\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad B'_y=\\frac{\\gamma}{c}f\\Bigl(\\gamma(1-\\frac{v}{c})(ct'-z')\\Bigr),\\quad \\text{(all other components vanish)}.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{The energy density } u=\\epsilon_0 f^2 \\text{ and momentum density } \\mathbf{g}=\\frac{\\epsilon_0 f^2}{c}\\hat z,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{so that upon integration the total energy and momentum } (U,0,0,P_z)\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{transform as } U'=\\gamma\\Bigl(U-\\frac{v}{c^2}P_z\\Bigr),\\quad P'_z=\\gamma\\Bigl(P_z-\\frac{v}{c^2}U\\Bigr).\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nAny answer which shows the above facts is correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & E\\cdot B=0\\quad \\text{and}\\quad E^2=c^2B^2 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; I_1=2\\Bigl(B^2-\\frac{E^2}{c^2}\\Bigr)=0,\\quad I_2=4(E\\cdot B)=0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{so these conditions, being Lorentz invariant, hold in every frame.}\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{Defining } n^\\mu=(1,\\mathbf{K}),\\; |\\mathbf{K}|=1,\\text{ we have } n^\\mu F_{\\mu\\nu}=0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{which is equivalent to } \\mathbf{K}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}=0 \\text{ and } \\mathbf{K}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}=0,\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{In a frame where } E_x=f(ct-z),\\; cB_y=f(ct-z),\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad E'_x=f\\Bigl(\\gamma(1-\\frac{v}{c})(ct'-z')\\Bigr),\\quad E'_z=\\frac{\\gamma v}{c}f\\Bigl(\\gamma(1-\\frac{v}{c})(ct'-z')\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad B'_y=\\frac{\\gamma}{c}f\\Bigl(\\gamma(1-\\frac{v}{c})(ct'-z')\\Bigr),\\quad \\text{(all other components vanish)}.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{The energy density } u=\\epsilon_0 f^2 \\text{ and momentum density } \\mathbf{g}=\\frac{\\epsilon_0 f^2}{c}\\hat z,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{so that upon integration the total energy and momentum } (U,0,0,P_z)\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{transform as } U'=\\gamma\\Bigl(U-\\frac{v}{c^2}P_z\\Bigr),\\quad P'_z=\\gamma\\Bigl(P_z-\\frac{v}{c^2}U\\Bigr).\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & E\\cdot B=0\\quad \\text{and}\\quad E^2=c^2B^2 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; I_1=2\\Bigl(B^2-\\frac{E^2}{c^2}\\Bigr)=0,\\quad I_2=4(E\\cdot B)=0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{so these conditions, being Lorentz invariant, hold in every frame.}\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{Defining } n^\\mu=(1,\\mathbf{K}),\\; |\\mathbf{K}|=1,\\text{ we have } n^\\mu F_{\\mu\\nu}=0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{which is equivalent to } \\mathbf{K}\\cdot\\mathbf{E}=0 \\text{ and } \\mathbf{K}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}=0,\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{In a frame where } E_x=f(ct-z),\\; cB_y=f(ct-z),\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad E'_x=f\\Bigl(\\gamma(1-\\frac{v}{c})(ct'-z')\\Bigr),\\quad E'_z=\\frac{\\gamma v}{c}f\\Bigl(\\gamma(1-\\frac{v}{c})(ct'-z')\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad B'_y=\\frac{\\gamma}{c}f\\Bigl(\\gamma(1-\\frac{v}{c})(ct'-z')\\Bigr),\\quad \\text{(all other components vanish)}.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{The energy density } u=\\epsilon_0 f^2 \\text{ and momentum density } \\mathbf{g}=\\frac{\\epsilon_0 f^2}{c}\\hat z,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{so that upon integration the total energy and momentum } (U,0,0,P_z)\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{transform as } U'=\\gamma\\Bigl(U-\\frac{v}{c^2}P_z\\Bigr),\\quad P'_z=\\gamma\\Bigl(P_z-\\frac{v}{c^2}U\\Bigr).\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{Lorentz invariance of } \\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0 \\text{ and } E^2 = c^2 B^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "electro/1_59", "solution": "We wish to determine the free charges, the electric field, the polarization (bound) surface charges, and the capacitance for a spherical “condenser” that is built of three concentric regions, namely\n\n• Region I: a < r < b, with a dielectric constant K₁,\n• Region II: b < r < c, which is vacuum (K = 1), and\n• Region III: c < r < d, with dielectric constant K₂.\n\nThe inner sphere (radius r = a) is charged to a potential V (with respect to the outer sphere) while the outer sphere (at r = d) is grounded (V = 0). (Note that the outer conductor is assumed to be thick so that its “inner” surface is at r = d.) Because the system is spherically symmetric we shall use Gauss’s law (written in terms of the electric displacement field D) and the standard formulas for dielectrics.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Find the Free Charges\n\nBy definition the D‐field satisfies  \n  ∇·D = ρ_free.\nIn a spherical Gaussian surface enclosing the inner sphere (free charge Q) we have\n  ∮D · dA = Q  ⟹  D(r) = Q/(4πr²)    (for any r > a).\nNotice that the free charge Q on the inner sphere is exactly balanced by the free charge (–Q) on the outer sphere.

To do so, we integrate the electric field from r = a to r = d. In any region, the electric field is given by\n\n  E = D/ε₀ε_r, \n(with ε_r = K₁ in I, 1 in II, and K₂ in III).

In the conductor the polarization is zero. (One may imagine that the bound charge “appears” only in the adjacent dielectric.) Choose the normal n to be the unit vector pointing from the dielectric into the cavity (i.e. toward the conductor).

In vacuum P = 0 and in the dielectric P = ε₀(K₂ – 1)E (with E taken in Region III). At r = c, in Region III,\n  E = Q/(4πε₀K₂c²).\nThus,\n  σ_P (r = c) = [ε₀(K₂ – 1)E – 0]⋅r̂ = ε₀(K₂ – 1)[Q/(4πε₀K₂c²)]\n         = (K₂ – 1) Q/(4πK₂c²).\n\n4. At r = d:\n Here the dielectric in Region III (with K₂) meets the conductor (outer sphere). In the dielectric just inside, we have P = ε₀(K₂ – 1)E (with E = Q/(4πε₀K₂d²) at r = d); and inside the conductor, P = 0.

{"id": "electro/3_25", "solution": "We are told that the “black box” (with two accessible terminals) contains a resistor R, an inductor L (lossless) and a capacitor C (lossless). Two types of measurements are made:\n\n1. With a 1.5‐V DC battery, a current I₍DC₎ = 1.5 mA is observed.\n2. With an AC voltage of 1.0 V (rms) at 60 Hz, the current is I₍60₎ = 0.01 A (rms).\n3. At higher frequencies – in fact, at f = 1000 Hz – the AC current becomes enormous (over 100 A) when 1.0 V is applied.\n\nOur goal is to determine a circuit consisting of R, L, and C and then find the component values.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. DC Behavior\n\nFor a DC source (f = 0 Hz) the behavior of L and C is standard:\n• A lossless inductor acts as a short.\n• A lossless capacitor acts as an open circuit.\nThus, if the circuit is arranged so that the resistor is “seen” by the battery when DC is applied, the most natural possibility is to have the resistor in parallel with a branch that will “short‐out” at AC frequencies (and be inactive at DC). One convenient arrangement is to have a series combination of L and C connected in parallel with R. (Look at the circuit on the right below.)\n\nWhen the battery is connected the series L–C branch is open (because at DC the capacitor is an open) so the only conduction path is through the resistor R. Hence, \n  1.5 V = I₍DC₎ • R ⟹ R = 1.5 V / 0.0015 A = 1000 Ω.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. AC Measurement at 60 Hz\n\nNow consider the circuit when an AC voltage is applied. The proposed circuit is:\n\n  The two terminals connect to a parallel combination of:\n   (1) a resistor R = 1000 Ω, and\n   (2) a series branch made up of L followed by C.\n\nLet the impedance of the series branch be Zₛ given by\n  Zₛ = jωL + 1/(jωC) = j (ωL – 1/(ωC)),\nwith ω = 2πf.\n\nThus, the admittance of the black box is the sum of the resistor’s admittance and the series branch’s admittance:\n  Y₍tot₎ = 1/R + 1/Zₛ\nand the overall magnitude of the impedance Z₍tot₎ is given by\n  |Z₍tot₎| = 1/|Y₍tot₎|.\n\nAt 60 Hz (f = 60 Hz, ω = 2π(60) = 120π rad/s) an rms voltage V = 1.0 V produces an rms current I = 0.01 A so that\n\n  |Z₍tot₎| = V/I = 1.0 V/0.01 A = 100 Ω.\n\nNow, with R = 1000 Ω and with the series branch having impedance Zₛ, the two are in parallel so\n\n  1/|Z₍tot₎| = 1/100 Ω = 1/1000 Ω + 1/|Zₛ|.\nSolving for |Zₛ| we have\n\n  1/|Zₛ| = 1/100 − 1/1000 = (10 – 1)/1000 = 9/1000 ⟹ |Zₛ| = 1000/9 ≈ 111.11 Ω.\n\nBut we already have\n  |Zₛ| = |ωL – 1/(ωC)|,\nso at 60 Hz\n\n  |120π L – 1/(120π C)| = 111.11 Ω.               (1)\n\nBefore we solve (1) let’s examine the high-frequency behavior.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 3. High-Frequency (Resonance) Behavior\n\nThe current becomes huge (over 100 A for a 1.0 V signal) at 1000 Hz. For the series combination L–C the impedance is\n\n  Zₛ = j (ωL – 1/(ωC)).\n\nWe see that if we choose L and C so that at a frequency f₀\n\n  ω₀L – 1/(ω₀C) = 0,\nthat branch will have zero impedance at resonance. In other words, the series L–C branch is in resonance when\n\n  ω₀ = 2πf₀ = 1/√(LC).\n\nAnd at f = 1000 Hz the LC branch is at resonance (since its impedance is 0) so that nearly all the applied voltage is dropped across the nearly short-circuited LC branch; hence, enormous currents can circulate inside that part of the network even though the externally measured “black box” impedance might be dominated by the very small impedance of the LC branch. (Note that the resistor R = 1000 Ω is still connected in parallel, but when one branch has nearly zero impedance, the net impedance seen at the terminals is nearly zero.)\n\nThus, we choose f₀ = 1000 Hz (ω₀ = 2π(1000) = 2000π rad/s) so that\n\n  1/(ω₀²) = LC ⟹ LC = 1/( (2000π)² ).             (2)\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Use the 60 Hz Equation to Find L and C\n\nWe now have two equations:\n  (1) |120π L – 1/(120π C)| = 111.11 Ω,\n  (2) L C = 1/( (2000π)² ).\n\nSince we expect at 60 Hz (which is much lower than the 1000 Hz resonance) that the series combination is dominated by the capacitor’s reactance, we assume that 1/(120π C) > 120π L. Then\n  1/(120π C) – 120π L = 111.11.            (1a)\n\nSolve (1a) for 1/(120π C):\n  1/(120π C) = 111.11 + 120π L.            (3)\n\nBut it is easier to use the resonance relation (2). Write L in terms of C:\n\n  L = 1/( (2000π)² C).\n\nNow substitute L into (1a):\n\n  1/(120π C) – 120π/( (2000π)² C) = 111.11.\n\nLet’s simplify the second term. Note that\n  (2000π)² = 4×10⁶ π².\nThus,\n  120π/( (2000π)² C) = 120π/(4×10⁶ π² C) = 120/(4×10⁶ π C).\n\nFactor 1/(π C) out of the left‐side:\n\n  (1/(π C)) [1/(120) – 120/(4×10⁶)] = 111.11.\n\nNow, compute the numerical factors:\n  1/120 ≈ 0.0083333,\n  120/(4×10⁶) = 120/4,000,000 = 0.00003.\nThus,\n  1/(π C) [0.0083333 – 0.00003] = 1/(π C) (0.0083033) = 111.11.\n\nSolve for 1/(π C):\n\n  1/(π C) = 111.11/0.0083033.\n\nCompute 111.11/0.0083033 ≈ 13370. (More precisely, you would get about 13370 rad/s.)\n\nThus,\n\n  1/(π C) = 13370 ⟹ C = 1/(π × 13370).\n\nNow, compute C:\n  π×13370 ≈ 3.1416×13370 ≈ 42000.\nSo,\n  C ≈ 1/42000 ≈ 2.38×10⁻⁵ F = 23.8 μF.\n\nNow, use (2) to find L:\n  L = 1/( (2000π)² C ) = 1/(4×10⁶ π² × 2.38×10⁻⁵).\n\nLet’s compute:\n  π² ≈ 9.87, so\n  Denom. ≈ 4×10⁶ × 9.87 × 2.38×10⁻⁵.\nFirst, 9.87 × 2.38×10⁻⁵ ≈ 2.35×10⁻⁴.\nThen, 4×10⁶ × 2.35×10⁻⁴ ≈ 940.\nThus,\n  L ≈ 1/940 ≈ 0.00106 H = 1.06 mH.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 5. Summary and Final Check\n\nSo one acceptable answer is to have the resistor R in parallel with a series LC branch. In summary the circuit is as follows:\n\n  – There is a resistor R = 1000 Ω across the external terminals.\n  – In parallel with R is a series combination of an inductor L and a capacitor C.\n  – The L and C are chosen so that they resonate at f₀ = 1/(2π√(LC)) = 1000 Hz.\n  – The computed values are L ≈ 1.06 mH and C ≈ 23.8 μF.\n\nHow does this agree with the measurements?\n• At DC the capacitor is an open and the inductor is a short, so only the 1000 Ω resistor conducts the 1.5 V leading to 1.5 mA.\n• At 60 Hz the impedance of the series LC branch is\n  |120π L – 1/(120π C)| ≈ |0.399 – 111.36| ≈ 111.0 Ω.\n  The parallel combination of 1000 Ω and 111 Ω is\n   Z₍tot₎ = (1000 × 111)/(1000+111) ≈ 100 Ω,\n  which with 1.0 V gives 10 mA.\n• At 1000 Hz the series LC branch has zero net reactance (resonance) so its impedance is nearly zero, so most of the current is shunted through it (hence the “huge” measured current).\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThus, the black box contains a 1000 Ω resistor in parallel with a series LC circuit with\n\n  L ≈ 1.06 mH  and  C ≈ 23.8 μF,\nchosen so that the LC branch is resonant at f₀ = 1000 Hz.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Circuit: } & R\\text{ (1000 Ω) in parallel with a series }L\\text{–}C\\text{ branch},\\\\[1mm]\n& \\text{with }L\\approx 1.06\\,\\text{mH},\\quad C\\approx 23.8\\,\\mu\\text{F}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Circuit: } & R\\text{ (1000 Ω) in parallel with a series }L\\text{–}C\\text{ branch},\\\\[1mm]\n& \\text{with }L\\approx 1.06\\,\\text{mH},\\quad C\\approx 23.8\\,\\mu\\text{F}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Circuit: } & R\\text{ (1000 Ω) in parallel with a series }L\\text{–}C\\text{ branch},\\\\[1mm]\n& \\text{with }L\\approx 1.06\\,\\text{mH},\\quad C\\approx 23.8\\,\\mu\\text{F}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "R = 10^3 \\, \\Omega"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "electro/3_13", "solution": "We wish to find the charge on the capacitor as a function of time when the switch is closed at t = 0. A convenient way to attack this problem is to use a mesh‐analysis approach. (Any method that leads to the correct effective differential–equation is acceptable.)\n\nLet us begin by describing the circuit. One way of “redrawing” the network is as follows (see also Fig. 3.22 in your text): \n\n • The “first loop” (mesh 1) consists of a battery of emf ε and internal resistance R₁ in series and includes the branch resistor R₃ as a “link” to the second loop.\n • The “second loop” (mesh 2) consists of a resistor R₂ in series with a capacitor C. This loop also shares the branch resistor R₃ with loop 1.\n\nThus the three branches are:\n 1. Battery + R₁ (and switch S),\n 2. R₂ and C in series,\n 3. R₃, which is common to both loops.\n\nOnce the switch S is closed (at t = 0) the battery will “start” charging C via the two loops.\n\nFor clarity we now define:\n • Mesh current I₁ in the “battery loop” (loop 1),\n • Mesh current I₂ in the “RC loop” (loop 2). \nWe also take the capacitor’s voltage to be q/C, and since the capacitor’s charge changes only due to the current in its own branch we have\n\n  dq/dt = I₂   .   (1)\n\nBecause resistor R₃ is common to both loops the actual voltage drop across it involves the difference (I₁ – I₂) (see the figure below, for instance). With this in mind, we now write Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) for the two loops.\n\n––––– Mesh 1: “Battery loop” –––––\nStarting at a convenient point and traversing the loop we pick up the emf and drops in the resistors:\n  ε – I₁ R₁ – (I₁ – I₂) R₃ = 0.   (2)\nSolving for I₁ we obtain\n  I₁ = [ε + R₃ I₂]/(R₁ + R₃).   (3)\n\n––––– Mesh 2: “RC loop” –––––\nHere the loop contains the resistor R₂, the capacitor, and the “shared” resistor R₃. Writing KVL (taking the drop across the capacitor as +q/C) gives:\n  – (I₂ – I₁) R₃ – I₂ R₂ – (q/C) = 0.   (4)\nRearrange (4) to write\n  (I₁ – I₂) R₃ – I₂ R₂ – (q/C) = 0.   (4′)\n\nNow substitute I₁ from (3) into (4′):\n\n  [ (ε + R₃ I₂)/(R₁+R₃) – I₂ ] R₃ – I₂ R₂ – (q/C) = 0.\n\nIt is a good idea to combine the two terms inside the bracket. Write\n  (ε + R₃ I₂)/(R₁+R₃) – I₂ = [ε + R₃ I₂ – I₂ (R₁+R₃)]/(R₁+R₃)\n    = [ε – I₂ R₁]/(R₁+R₃).\n\nThus (4′) becomes\n\n  (ε – I₂ R₁) R₃/(R₁+R₃) – I₂ R₂ – (q/C) = 0.\n\nNow, solving for the terms that involve I₂ we have\n\n  (ε R₃)/(R₁+R₃) – I₂ [ R₁R₃/(R₁+R₃) + R₂ ] – (q/C) = 0.   (5)\n\nRemember that I₂ = dq/dt so (5) becomes a first–order differential equation:\n\n  dq/dt · (R₂ + (R₁R₃)/(R₁+R₃)) + (q/C) = (ε R₃)/(R₁+R₃).   (6)\n\nIt is convenient now to define an \"effective resistance\" for the second loop:\n\n  R_eff = R₂ + (R₁R₃)/(R₁+R₃).\n\nThus (6) becomes\n\n  dq/dt + (1/(C R_eff)) q = (ε R₃)/( (R₁+R₃) C R_eff).   (7)\n\nThis is a linear first–order ordinary differential equation whose standard solution is easily written. Its homogeneous part is\n\n  dq/dt + (1/(C R_eff)) q = 0,\nwith solution\n\n  q_h(t) = A exp[ –t/(C R_eff) ].\n\nA particular solution is given by the constant solution\n\n  q_p = ( (ε R₃)/( (R₁+R₃) C R_eff) ) / (1/(C R_eff))\n    = (ε R₃)/(R₁+R₃) · C R_eff/(C R_eff’s denominator cancels) \n    = (ε R₃ C R_eff)/(R₁+R₃).\n\nThus the general solution is\n\n  q(t) = q_p + [q(0) – q_p] exp[ –t/(C R_eff) ].   (8)\n\nWe now state the answers for (a) and (b) as follows:\n\n–––––––––––\nPart (a): q(0) = 0 \n–––––––––––\nSubstitute q(0)=0 in (8):\n\n  q(t) = (ε R₃ C R_eff)/(R₁+R₃) [ 1 – exp( –t/(C R_eff) ) ],\nwith\n  R_eff = R₂ + (R₁R₃)/(R₁+R₃).\n\n–––––––––––\nPart (b): q(0) = Q₀ \n–––––––––––\nThen the answer becomes\n\n  q(t) = Q₀ exp( –t/(C R_eff) ) + (ε R₃ C R_eff)/(R₁+R₃) [ 1 – exp( –t/(C R_eff) ) ].\n \n–––––––––––\n\nIt is sometimes useful to “clear denominators” in R_eff.

(e) Gauge dependence\n\nIt turns out that among the four parameters in our decomposition the two coefficients a₁ and a₂ (the amplitudes multiplying the two transverse polarization four–vectors ε^(1) and ε^(2)) determine the physical, gauge–invariant degrees of freedom. In contrast, a_L and a_B enter the potential in the directions which are “pure gauge” (or can be gauged away by a suitable gauge transformation), and therefore these coefficients are gauge–dependent.

(f) Average energy density\n\nAfter the constraints have been imposed the only “physical” polarization amplitudes for a propagating plane wave are a₁ and a₂.

A standard calculation shows that for a plane wave the average (over one period) energy density is given by\n\n  u = (|E|² + |B|²)/(8π).\n\nA short calculation shows that, after using the dispersion relation (ω = cK) and expressing the electric field in terms of the potential (E ~ (iω/c) a), one finds that\n\n  |E|² ∝ (ω²/c²)(|a₁|² + |a₂|²).\n\n(In fact one also finds |B|² = |E|².)

(a) Magnetic Field Inside the Solenoid\n\nFor an ideal solenoid the magnetic field inside is given by\n\n  B = μ₀ n i\n\n(where μ₀ is the permeability of free space). Since i is time dependent, we immediately substitute:\n\n  B(t) = μ₀ n i₀ sin(ωt).\n\nThus, the magnetic induction (field) inside the solenoid is\n\n  B(t) = μ₀ n i₀ sin(ωt) ẑ   (for r < b),\n\nand we assume\n\n  B(t) = 0          (for r > b).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. (b) Electric Field by Faraday’s Law\n\nA time‐dependent magnetic field induces an electric field, given in integral form by Faraday’s law:\n\n  ∮ E · dl = − dΦ/dt.\n\nBecause of the cylindrical symmetry, the induced electric field will have only an azimuthal (φ‑direction) component, E = Eφ(r, t) φ̂, and its lines of force will be circles centered on the axis.\n\nWe now consider two cases: one for a circular loop of radius r ≤ b (inside the solenoid) and one for r > b (outside).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nCase 1: Inside the Solenoid (r ≤ b)\n\nChoose a circular loop of radius r (with r ≤ b) centered on the solenoid’s axis. Then\n\n  ∮ E · dl = Eφ  (2πr).\n\nThe magnetic flux through the circle is the product of the magnetic field (assumed uniform over the cross‐section of the solenoid) and the area of the circle:\n\n  Φ = (Area) B = πr² · [μ₀ n i₀ sin(ωt)].\n\nDifferentiate with respect to time:\n\n  dΦ/dt = πr² μ₀ n i₀ ω cos(ωt).\n\nBy Faraday’s law:\n\n  Eφ (2πr) = − dΦ/dt\n      = −πr² μ₀ n i₀ ω cos(ωt).\n\nSolve for Eφ:\n\n  Eφ(r,t) = − (πr² μ₀ n i₀ ω cos(ωt)) / (2πr)\n       = − (r μ₀ n i₀ ω cos(ωt)) / 2.\n\nThus, for r ≤ b we have\n\n  E(r,t) = − (μ₀ n i₀ ω cos(ωt) / 2) r φ̂.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nCase 2: Outside the Solenoid (r > b)\n\nFor a circular loop of radius r > b the only flux comes from the region inside the solenoid, where B ≠ 0.

Graph of |E| vs. r (at fixed time t = 2π/ω):\n   • At t = 2π/ω, note that cos(ωt) = cos(2π) = 1, so we consider\n  Inside (r ≤ b): |E| = (μ₀ n i₀ ω / 2) r.\n  Outside (r > b): |E| = (b² μ₀ n i₀ ω / (2r)).\n   • A plot of |E| versus r will show a straight-line increase from 0 at r = 0 up to a maximum value at r = b given by |E| = (b μ₀ n i₀ ω / 2). For r > b the graph will decrease as 1/r.\n   • This gives a “V‐shape” (in the sense of a rising line that then falls off) with the peak at r = b.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers in Summary\n\n(a) Magnetic Field inside the solenoid:\n\n  B(r, t) = { μ₀ n i₀ sin(ωt) ẑ   for r < b,\n         0        for r > b. }\n\n(b) Induced Electric Field:\n\nFor r ≤ b:\n\n  E(r, t) = − [ (μ₀ n i₀ ω cos(ωt)) / 2 ] r φ̂.\n\nFor r > b:\n\n  E(r, t) = − [ (b² μ₀ n i₀ ω cos(ωt)) / (2r) ] φ̂.\n\nAt time t = 2π/ω (so that cos(ωt)=1), the magnitude of E is\n\n  |E| = { (μ₀ n i₀ ω / 2) r  (r ≤ b),\n       (b² μ₀ n i₀ ω) / (2r)  (r > b). }\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r},t) = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\mu_0 n\\, i_0\\, \\sin(\\omega t)\\, \\hat{z}, & r < b,\\\\[1mm]\n0, & r > b,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r},t) = \n\\begin{cases}\n-\\dfrac{\\mu_0 n\\, i_0\\, \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)}{2}\\, r\\, \\hat{\\phi}, & r \\le b,\\\\[2mm]\n-\\dfrac{\\mu_0 n\\, i_0\\, \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)}{2}\\, \\dfrac{b^2}{r}\\, \\hat{\\phi}, & r > b.\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r},t) = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\mu_0 n\\, i_0\\, \\sin(\\omega t)\\, \\hat{z}, & r < b,\\\\[1mm]\n0, & r > b,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r},t) = \n\\begin{cases}\n-\\dfrac{\\mu_0 n\\, i_0\\, \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)}{2}\\, r\\, \\hat{\\phi}, & r \\le b,\\\\[2mm]\n-\\dfrac{\\mu_0 n\\, i_0\\, \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)}{2}\\, \\dfrac{b^2}{r}\\, \\hat{\\phi}, & r > b.\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r},t) = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\mu_0 n\\, i_0\\, \\sin(\\omega t)\\, \\hat{z}, & r < b,\\\\[1mm]\n0, & r > b,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r},t) = \n\\begin{cases}\n-\\dfrac{\\mu_0 n\\, i_0\\, \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)}{2}\\, r\\, \\hat{\\phi}, & r \\le b,\\\\[2mm]\n-\\dfrac{\\mu_0 n\\, i_0\\, \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)}{2}\\, \\dfrac{b^2}{r}\\, \\hat{\\phi}, & r > b.\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{B}(t) = \\mu_0 n i_0 \\sin(\\omega t) \\mathbf{e}_z"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r},t) = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\mu_0 n\\, i_0\\, \\sin(\\omega t)\\, \\hat{z}, & r < b,\\\\[1mm]\n0, & r > b,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r},t) = \n\\begin{cases}\n-\\dfrac{\\mu_0 n\\, i_0\\, \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)}{2}\\, r\\, \\hat{\\phi}, & r \\le b,\\\\[2mm]\n-\\dfrac{\\mu_0 n\\, i_0\\, \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)}{2}\\, \\dfrac{b^2}{r}\\, \\hat{\\phi}, & r > b.\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{E}(t) = -\\frac{\\mu_0}{2} n i_0 \\omega r \\cos (\\omega t) \\mathbf{e}_\\theta"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r},t) = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\mu_0 n\\, i_0\\, \\sin(\\omega t)\\, \\hat{z}, & r < b,\\\\[1mm]\n0, & r > b,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r},t) = \n\\begin{cases}\n-\\dfrac{\\mu_0 n\\, i_0\\, \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)}{2}\\, r\\, \\hat{\\phi}, & r \\le b,\\\\[2mm]\n-\\dfrac{\\mu_0 n\\, i_0\\, \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)}{2}\\, \\dfrac{b^2}{r}\\, \\hat{\\phi}, & r > b.\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{E}(t) = -\\frac{b^2}{2r} n i_0 \\omega \\cos (\\omega t) \\mathbf{e}_\\theta"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r},t) = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\mu_0 n\\, i_0\\, \\sin(\\omega t)\\, \\hat{z}, & r < b,\\\\[1mm]\n0, & r > b,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r},t) = \n\\begin{cases}\n-\\dfrac{\\mu_0 n\\, i_0\\, \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)}{2}\\, r\\, \\hat{\\phi}, & r \\le b,\\\\[2mm]\n-\\dfrac{\\mu_0 n\\, i_0\\, \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)}{2}\\, \\dfrac{b^2}{r}\\, \\hat{\\phi}, & r > b.\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{E} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega} \\right) = -\\frac{\\mu_0}{2} n i_0 \\omega r \\mathbf{e}_\\theta"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Recall\n\n  e_R = (x̂ + i ŷ)/√2  and  e_L = (x̂ − i ŷ)/√2.\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for E_r:\n\n  E_r(z, t) = E₀/√2 e^(i(−kz − ωt)) [ r_R (x̂ + i ŷ)/√2 + r_L (x̂ − i ŷ)/√2 ]\n         = E₀/2 e^(i(−kz − ωt)) [ (r_R + r_L)x̂ + i (r_R − r_L)ŷ ].\n\nThus the reflected field has an x–component proportional to (r_R + r_L) and a y–component proportional to i(r_R − r_L). In general, if r_R ≠ r_L the reflected light is elliptically polarized. (In the special case r_R = r_L the polarization will remain linear, and if r_R and r_L differ only by a phase then the polarization may be rotated, but in general they yield an elliptical state.)\n\nStep 4. Calculate the intensity of the reflected light.\n\nThe intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude. Since the two circular components were originally of equal amplitude, the reflected intensity is given by\n\n  I_r ∝ ½ (|r_R|² + |r_L|²).\n\nMore exactly, if the incident intensity is proportional to E₀², the reflected intensity is\n\n  I_r = E₀²/2 (|r_R|² + |r_L|²).\n\nThus, the reflectivity is the average of the reflection intensities for the two circular polarizations.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\nThe reflected electric field is\n\n  E_r(z, t) = (E₀/2)e^(i(−kz − ωt)) [(r_R + r_L)x̂ + i (r_R − r_L)ŷ],\n  with r_R = (1 − n_R)/(1 + n_R) and r_L = (1 − n_L)/(1 + n_L).\n\nThe reflected intensity is given by\n\n  I_r ∝ (E₀²/2)(|r_R|² + |r_L|²).\n\nThis shows that the reflected light is generally elliptically polarized when n_R ≠ n_L.\n\nFinal boxed answer:\n\n  \\[\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\nE_{r}(z,t) &= \\frac{E_0}{2}\\,e^{i(-kz-\\omega t)}\n\\Bigl[(r_R+r_L)\\,\\hat x + i(r_R-r_L)\\,\\hat y\\Bigr],\n\\\\[1mm]\nr_R &= \\frac{1-n_R}{1+n_R},\\quad r_L=\\frac{1-n_L}{1+n_L},\\\\[1mm]\nI_{r} &\\propto \\frac{E_0^2}{2}\\Bigl(|r_R|^2 + |r_L|^2\\Bigr).\n\\end{aligned}\n}\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\nE_{r}(z,t) &= \\frac{E_0}{2}\\,e^{i(-kz-\\omega t)}\n\\Bigl[(r_R+r_L)\\,\\hat x + i(r_R-r_L)\\,\\hat y\\Bigr],\n\\\\[1mm]\nr_R &= \\frac{1-n_R}{1+n_R},\\quad r_L=\\frac{1-n_L}{1+n_L},\\\\[1mm]\nI_{r} &\\propto \\frac{E_0^2}{2}\\Bigl(|r_R|^2 + |r_L|^2\\Bigr).\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\nE_{r}(z,t) &= \\frac{E_0}{2}\\,e^{i(-kz-\\omega t)}\n\\Bigl[(r_R+r_L)\\,\\hat x + i(r_R-r_L)\\,\\hat y\\Bigr],\n\\\\[1mm]\nr_R &= \\frac{1-n_R}{1+n_R},\\quad r_L=\\frac{1-n_L}{1+n_L},\\\\[1mm]\nI_{r} &\\propto \\frac{E_0^2}{2}\\Bigl(|r_R|^2 + |r_L|^2\\Bigr).\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{Polarization: elliptically polarized}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\nE_{r}(z,t) &= \\frac{E_0}{2}\\,e^{i(-kz-\\omega t)}\n\\Bigl[(r_R+r_L)\\,\\hat x + i(r_R-r_L)\\,\\hat y\\Bigr],\n\\\\[1mm]\nr_R &= \\frac{1-n_R}{1+n_R},\\quad r_L=\\frac{1-n_L}{1+n_L},\\\\[1mm]\nI_{r} &\\propto \\frac{E_0^2}{2}\\Bigl(|r_R|^2 + |r_L|^2\\Bigr).\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{I''}{I} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{1-n_R}{1+n_R} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{1-n_L}{1+n_L} \\right)^2 \\right]"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "(1 - n)/(n + 1)", "expr2": "(n**2 - 2*n + 1)/(n**2 + 2*n + 1)"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Reflection and Refraction at a Dielectric Interface\n\nNow consider an electromagnetic plane wave incident upon a plane boundary between two different dielectric media. Let the upper half–space be medium 1 (with parameters ε₁, μ₁, index n₁ = √(μ₁ε₁)) and the lower half–space be medium 2 (with parameters ε₂, μ₂, index n₂ = √(μ₂ε₂)). The incident wave makes an angle θᵢ with the normal to the interface.\n\nAt the interface we apply the electromagnetic boundary conditions. In the absence of surface charges and surface currents the tangential components of E and H must be continuous across the interface:\n\n  (E₁)ₜ = (E₂)ₜ  and  (H₁)ₜ = (H₂)ₜ.\n\nBecause the fields are assumed to be sinusoidal in time the phase of the waves must match along the interface. Consider the directions parallel to the plane of the interface. The component of the wavevector parallel to the interface must be the same for the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves. This “phase matching” condition leads to:\n\n  k₁ sinθᵢ = k₁ sinθᵣ  and  k₁ sinθᵢ = k₂ sinθₜ,\nwhere k₁ = ω/v₁ and k₂ = ω/v₂ with vᵢ = 1/√(μᵢεᵢ). \n\nSince k₁ sinθᵢ = k₁ sinθᵣ, we get\n  θᵣ = θᵢ,\nwhich is the law of reflection.\n\nThe relation\n  k₁ sinθᵢ = k₂ sinθₜ\ncan be rewritten in terms of the indices of refraction (recalling that n = c/v, if we define c as the speed of light in vacuum, i.e. nᵢ = √(μᵢ εᵢ/μ₀ ε₀)):\n  n₁ sinθᵢ = n₂ sinθₜ.\nThis is known as Snell’s law of refraction.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\nThus, summarizing:\n\n(a) Maxwell’s equations in a non–conducting medium (with ρ = 0, j = 0) are\n  ∇·E = 0,  ∇·B = 0,\n  ∇×E = -∂B/∂t,  ∇×B = με ∂E/∂t.\nBoth E and B satisfy the wave equation\n  ∇²E = με ∂²E/∂t²,  ∇²B = με ∂²B/∂t²,\nwith wave speed\n  v = 1/√(με).\nThe plane wave solutions are\n  E(r,t) = E₀ exp[i(k·r -

(b) Limiting Values of K\n\nThere are two limits.\n\n1. Very good conductor: σ ≫ εω.\n Then the jωμ₀σ term dominates and\n  K² ≈ jωμ₀σ.\nTaking the square root (recall √j = (1+j)/√2), we find\n  K ≈ (1+j) √(ωμ₀σ/2).\n\n2. Very poor conductor (or nearly loss‐free dielectric): σ ≪ εω.\n In that case one may expand the square root by writing\n  K = ω√(μ₀ε) √[1 + j (σ/(ωε))] \n    ≈ ω√(μ₀ε) [1 + j(σ/(2ωε))],\nso that the real part is ω√(μ₀ε) and the (small) imaginary part is\n  Im(K) ≈ (σ/(2)) √(μ₀/ε).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 3. (c) The e^(–1) Penetration Depth δ for Power\n\nBecause the field in the lossy medium behaves as exp(–jKz) = exp(–jRe(K)z) exp(–Im(K)z), the power (proportional to the square of the field) decays as\n  Power ∝ exp(–2 Im(K) z).\nIf we define δ as the distance over which the power is reduced by a factor e^(–1) then\n  2 Im(K) δ = 1  ⟹ δ = 1/(2 Im(K)).\nFor the case of a “poor conductor” (σ ≪ εω) we already saw that\n  Im(K) ≈ (σ/(2)) √(μ₀/ε).\nThen\n  δ = 1/(2 · (σ/(2))√(μ₀/ε)) = 1/(σ√(μ₀/ε)).\n(This result is valid in the regime in which dispersion may be “perturbatively” handled. In the good‐conductor limit one defines the skin depth δ_skin typically as 1/Im(K); however note that since our definition here is for the power e^(–1) decay, one must keep in mind the use of the factor 2.)\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 4. (d) Power Transmission Coefficient T (for σ ≪ εω)\n\nWhen a wave is normally incident at an interface, the intrinsic impedances in the two media are (with μ = μ₀ in both regions)\n  η₁ = √(μ₀/ε₀)  (in air, for z<0)\n  η₂ = √(μ₀/(ε + j(σ/ω)))  (in the lossy dielectric, for z>0).\nIf the conductivity is small (σ ≪ εω) one may approximate\n  η₂ ≈ √(μ₀/ε) [1 – j (σ/(2ωε))],\nso that Re{η₂} ≈ √(μ₀/ε) (a real number).\n\nFor normal incidence the Fresnel amplitude transmission coefficient is\n  t = 2η₂/(η₂ + η₁).\nThe corresponding power transmission coefficient is given by\n  T = (Re{η₂}/η₁) |t|² \n    = (4Re{η₂}η₁)/|η₂+η₁|².\nThus one acceptable answer is \n  T = (4η₁ Re{η₂})/|η₁ + η₂|²,\nwith η₁ = √(μ₀/ε₀) and, for small loss, η₂ ≈ √(μ₀/ε).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 5. (e) Numerical Evaluation for Beef at 2.45 GHz\n\nWe are told that for beef at 2.45 GHz, we have approximately\n  ε/ε₀ = 49  ⟹  √(ε/ε₀) = 7\n  σ = 2 mho/m.\nAlso, ω = 2π × 2.45×10⁹ ≈ 15.4×10⁹ rad/s.\n\nIntrinsic impedances are:\n In air:\n  η₀ = √(μ₀/ε₀) ≈ 377 Ω.\n In beef:\n  η₂ ≈ √(μ₀/ε) = √(μ₀/(49ε₀)) = η₀/7 ≈ 377/7 ≈ 54 Ω.\nBecause σ is very small compared to εω (indeed σ/ (ωε) is very small), we may neglect the small imaginary part in η₂ when computing T. Then\n  T = [4η₀η₂]/(η₀ + η₂)²\n    = [4 × 377 × (377/7)] / [377 + (377/7)]².\nNote that \n  η₀ + η₂ = 377 + 377/7 = 377 (1 + 1/7) = 377(8/7).\nThus,\n  T = [4 × (377²/7)] / [ (377×8/7)² ] = [4 × (377²/7)] / [377² × 64/49] \n    = (4/7)×(49/64) = (196)/(448) = 0.4375.\nSo about 44% of the normally–incident power is transmitted.\n\nNext, we evaluate the penetration depth for power. As shown above in part (c), for a poor conductor (σ ≪ εω)\n  δ = 1/(σ √(μ₀/ε)).\nWe note that\n  √(μ₀/ε) = √(μ₀/(49ε₀)) = (1/7)√(μ₀/ε₀) = η₀/7.\nTaking η₀ ≈ 377 Ω (or, more precisely, using the numbers in SI units), we can also compute directly. However, it is simplest to work in SI units. Recall that\n  μ₀ = 4π×10^(–7) H/m  and  ε₀ ≈ 8.854×10^(–12) F/m.\nThen\n  ε = 49ε₀ ≈ 4.338×10^(–10) F/m,\nand\n  μ₀/ε ≈ (1.2566×10^(–6))/(4.338×10^(–10)) ≈ 2897.\nThus, \n  √(μ₀/ε) ≈ √2897 ≈ 53.8 (in SI units, m^(–1/2)? More precisely, it gives a number in ohm‐like units, but here it is simply a number needed to estimate δ).\nThen\n  δ = 1/(σ √(μ₀/ε)) = 1/(2 × 53.8) ≈ 1/107.6 ≈ 0.0093 m,\ni.e. about 0.93 cm.\n\nA penetration depth on the order of 1 cm is in marked contrast to infrared (or broiler) heating where the absorption depth is typically only a few microns; therefore, microwaves have the advantage of heating a much thicker “volume” of the material.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The dispersion relation is \n  K² = ω²μ₀ (ε + j (σ/ω)).\n\n(b) In the good‐conductor limit (σ ≫ εω): \n  K ≈ (1+j) √(ωμ₀σ/2);\n in the poor–conductor limit (σ ≪ εω):\n  K ≈ ω√(μ₀ε) + j (σ/(2)) √(μ₀/ε).\n\n(c) The e^(–1) penetration depth for power is \n  δ = 1/(σ √(μ₀/ε)).\n\n(d) The power transmission coefficient (for normal incidence) is \n  T = (4η₁ Re{η₂})/|η₁+η₂|²  with η₁ = √(μ₀/ε₀) and η₂ ≈ √(μ₀/ε).\n\n(e) For 2.45 GHz beef with ε/ε₀ = 49 and σ = 2 mho/m, one finds\n  T ≈ 0.44 (i.e. about 44% of the incident power is transmitted)\nand\n  δ ≈ 0.93 cm.\nSince infrared (broiling) typically heats only a very thin surface layer (on the order of microns), the relatively large microwave penetration depth indicates a significant advantage for microwave heating in terms of volumetric (rather than solely surface) heating.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer in LaTeX Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &K^2 = \\omega^2\\mu_0\\Bigl(\\varepsilon + \\frac{j\\sigma}{\\omega}\\Bigr).\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{For } \\sigma\\gg\\varepsilon\\omega:\\;

{"id": "electro/4_17", "solution": "We wish to show that a beam of light propagating in a nonlinear medium\n\n  n = n₀ + n₂E²        (1)\n\ncan “self‐trap” (i.e. not spread out by diffraction) because the intensity‐dependent increase in refractive index acts as a waveguide (via total internal reflection) for the beam. In what follows we will compare the divergence due to diffraction with the angular “protection” offered by the nonlinearly induced index “well” and then obtain a threshold power.\n\nLet’s go through the steps.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Diffraction Divergence\n\nA beam that passes through a circular aperture (or has a transverse extent of size D) will diffract, emerging with an angular spread given by\n\n  θ_d = 1.22 λₙ/D,      (2)\n\nwhere λₙ is the wavelength in the medium. (Often one writes λₙ = λ/n₀, so that one may also write\n\n  θ_d = 1.22 (λ/n₀) /D.)\n\nThus the rays that “escape” the central region do so by leaving at an angle approximately θ_d relative to the propagation axis.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Index Change and “Guiding” by Total Internal Reflection\n\nNow, in our nonlinear medium the refractive index increases in the region of high intensity. If the beam has a high enough intensity (and its central region then has index n_core = n₀ + δn, with δn = n₂E²), then the beam may self-guide.\n\nImagine the beam as a “fiber” with core index\n\n  n_core = n₀ + δn   with δn = n₂E²,\n\nand cladding index n₀. Then, a ray inside the high‐intensity core that strikes the interface at an angle of incidence α (measured relative to the normal to the boundary) will be internally reflected provided that\n\n  α ≥ θ_c,     (3)\n\nwhere the critical angle θ_c is given by\n\n  sin θ_c = n₀/(n₀ + δn).  (4)\n\nNow, if we consider a ray that propagates nearly parallel to the axis but eventually reaches the edge, it will (roughly) leave the beam at the diffractive angle θ_d; geometrically one finds that the ray will hit the side at an angle with respect to the normal given by\n\n  α = 90° – θ_d.\n\nThus, for total internal reflection (TIR) the condition is\n\n  90° – θ_d ≥ θ_c   or  θ_d ≤ 90° – θ_c.  (5)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Approximating for Small Index Changes\n\nFor many optical media δn = n₂E² is small compared with n₀. Then we can expand the expression (4) for the critical angle. Because\n\n  sin θ_c = n₀/(n₀ + δn) ≈ 1 – δn/n₀   (for δn/n₀ ≪ 1),\n \nthe critical angle will be very near 90°. It is more useful to write the TIR condition in “ray‐angle” language. Note that if a ray strikes the interface at an angle α = 90° – θ_d (with θ_d small), then the condition for TIR becomes (to leading order) a condition on θ_d. Writing\n\n  cos θ_c = √(1 – sin²θ_c) ≈ √(1 – (1 – 2δn/n₀)) = √(2δn/n₀),  (6)\n\nwe see that the “allowed” deviation inside the core is roughly bounded by\n\n  θ_d ≲ √(2δn/n₀) = √(2 n₂E²/n₀).  (7)\n\nThus (approximately) to have self-trapping we require that the angular spread from diffraction be no larger than the “trapping angle” provided by the nonlinear index change:\n\n  θ_d ≈ 1.22 λₙ/D ≲ √(2 n₂E²/n₀).  (8)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Finding the Threshold Field\n\nWe set the two angles equal in the threshold case:\n\n  1.22 λₙ/D = √(2 n₂E²₍ₜₕ₎/n₀).  (9)\n\nSquaring both sides gives\n\n  (1.22)² λₙ² /D² = 2 n₂E²₍ₜₕ₎/n₀   ⇒  E²₍ₜₕ₎ = (1.22)² λₙ² n₀/(2 n₂ D²).  (10)\n\nRemember that the wavelength in the medium is λₙ = λ/n₀.

Converting to Threshold Power\n\nThe time‐averaged intensity I (power per unit area) in a medium with refractive index n₀ is given by\n\n  I = ½ n₀ c ε₀ E².     (12)\n\nThus the threshold intensity becomes\n\n  I₍ₜₕ₎ = ½ n₀ c ε₀ E²₍ₜₕ₎\n        = ½ n₀ c ε₀ [(1.22)² λ²/(2 n₂ n₀ D²)]\n        = (1.22)² c ε₀ λ²/(4 n₂ D²).  (13)\n\nFor a beam whose cross‐sectional area (we assume a circular cross section) is\n\n  A = π(D/2)² = πD²/4,\n \nthe threshold power is\n\n  P₍ₜₕ₎ = I₍ₜₕ₎ A\n    = [(1.22)² c ε₀ λ²/(4 n₂ D²)] × (πD²/4)\n    = (π (1.22)² c ε₀ λ²)/(16 n₂).  (14)\n\nNotice that the D² cancels: the threshold power for self‐trapping does not depend on the beam diameter. (This is a well–known result for “critical power” phenomena in Kerr media.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 6. Final Answer\n\nThus, the threshold power for the existence of a self‐trapped beam in a nonlinear medium with n = n₀ + n₂E² is\n\n  P₍ₜₕ₎ = (π (1.22)² c ε₀ λ²)/(16 n₂).\n\nWe now box the final answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{ P_{th}=\\frac{\\pi (1.22)^2\\, c\\,\\epsilon_0\\, \\lambda^2}{16\\, n_{2}} }\n\\]\n\n──────────────────────────────\nDiscussion\n\nWhat we have shown is that if the intensity is high enough so that the nonlinear index change δn = n₂E² produces a “trapping angle” (approximately √(2δn/n₀)) that is at least as large as the diffractive spread (≈1.22λ/(n₀D)), then total internal reflection at the edge of the “nonlinear waveguide” can prevent the beam from diffracting.

{"id": "electro/4_16", "solution": "We wish to determine the spatial variation of the fields in medium 1 (of index n₁) when a plane‐wave of frequency ν is normally incident on an interface with medium 2 (of index n₂). In what follows we let d denote the distance from the interface into medium 1. (Thus d = 0 at the interface.) We assume that the incident wave comes from medium 1 and that only a fraction of energy ρ is reflected. (In energy terms ρ = |r|² so that the amplitude reflection coefficient is |r| = √ρ.) In addition, we are told that when n₂ > n₁ the electric field gets a phase change of π on reflection – that is, the reflected E–field has the opposite sign from what it would have if no phase change had occurred.\n\nBelow we explain step by step how one may obtain an answer. (Any answer equivalent to the answer given below is correct.) \n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (a): Electric field and its intensity\n\n1. For d ≥ 0 (in medium 1) we take the incident electric field to be\n\n  Eᵢ(d,t) = E₀ cos (k₁ d – ωt)    (1)\n\nwhere\n  k₁ = 2π n₁/λ₀      (λ₀ is the wavelength in vacuum)\n  ω = 2πν.\n\n2. The reflected wave (traveling in the –d direction) then is\n\n  Eᵣ(d,t) = E₀r cos (k₁ d + ωt).\n\nBecause the electric field picks up a phase shift of π on reflection we have r = –√ρ. Thus\n\n  Eᵣ(d,t) = –√ρ E₀ cos (k₁ d + ωt).    (2)\n\n3. The total electric field in medium 1 is the sum,\n\n  E(d,t) = Eᵢ(d,t) + Eᵣ(d,t)\n      = E₀ [cos (k₁ d – ωt) – √ρ cos (k₁ d + ωt)].    (3)\n\nIt is sometimes useful to write this as a sum of standing‐wave and traveling pieces. (For ρ = 1 it becomes a perfect standing wave.) \n\n4. To study the energy density carried by the electric field we need the time–averaged square. Using the well known averages,\n  ⟨cos²⟩ = 1/2 \nand \n  ⟨cos (k₁ d – ωt) cos (k₁ d + ωt)⟩ = ½ cos (2k₁ d),\none obtains\n\n  ⟨E²(d)⟩ = (E₀²/2)[1 + ρ] – E₀² √ρ cos(2 k₁ d).    (4)\n\nThe spatial variation is periodic with period π/k₁ and so the maxima and minima occur when the cosine takes its extreme values.\n\n• Maximum ⟨E²⟩: Occurs when cos (2k₁ d) = –1. That is,\n  2k₁ d = π + 2π m  →  d = (π/2 + π m)/k₁  , m an integer.\n\n• Minimum ⟨E²⟩: Occurs when cos (2k₁ d) = +1. That is,\n  2k₁ d = 2π m  →  d = π m/k₁  , m an integer.\n\nIn particular, note that at the interface, d = 0, one has cos 0 = +1 so that\n\n  ⟨E²(0)⟩ = (E₀²/2)(1+ρ) – E₀² √ρ  ,\n\nwhich is a minimum when ρ ≠ 0.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (b): Magnetic field and its intensity\n\nFor a plane wave in a non–magnetic dielectric the electric and magnetic fields are related by\n  B = (n₁/c) E  \n(with appropriate direction given by the right–hand rule). However, one must be cautious with superpositions because the reflection may “invert” one field and not the other. \n\n1. Let the incident magnetic field be\n\n  Bᵢ(d,t) = (n₁E₀/c) cos (k₁ d – ωt).    (5)\n\n2. For the reflected wave, since the electric field gets a minus sign on reflection the relation (together with the rule that B = ˆk × E / ω in a plane wave) implies that there is no additional π phase change in the magnetic field (because reversing the propagation direction reverses the sign of the cross–product). One may show that\n\n  Bᵣ(d,t) = (n₁E₀/c) √ρ cos (k₁ d + ωt).    (6)\n\n3. Thus the total magnetic field is\n\n  B(d,t) = Bᵢ(d,t) + Bᵣ(d,t)\n      = (n₁E₀/c)[cos (k₁ d – ωt) + √ρ cos (k₁ d + ωt)].   (7)\n\nCompare with the result (3) for E(d,t). Notice that while the electric fields subtract, the magnetic fields add. \n\n4. The corresponding time–averaged square, using the same trigonometric averages as above, is\n\n  ⟨B²(d)⟩ = (n₁²E₀²/c²)[(1+ρ)/2 + √ρ cos (2k₁ d)].   (8)\n\nThus, the maxima of ⟨B²⟩ occur when cos (2k₁ d) = +1 (i.e. when d = πm/k₁) and minima occur when cos (2k₁ d) = –1 (i.e. when d = (π/2 + πm)/k₁).\n\nIn summary, while the electric field is inverted upon reflection (acquiring a phase shift of π) the magnetic field has no extra phase shift.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (c): Origin of the darkening in Wiener’s experiment\n\nO.

When light is reflected, the change in momentum is larger than for pure absorption. (For a perfectly reflecting mirror the momentum change per photon is doubled.) In our problem, the light is partly reflected at the first (air–glass) interface and partly transmitted. If we neglect interference effects (i.e. we treat the different passages through the two surfaces as independent and add the momentum changes incoherently), the situation is as follows:\n\n1. A fraction R of the incident intensity is reflected from the first interface. Since the change in momentum for each reflected photon is 2p (where p = E/c is the momentum of each photon), the momentum transfer per unit time (i.e. the force per unit area, or pressure) due to the reflection is\n\n  P_reflection = 2R I/c.\n\n2. The remainder of the intensity, (1 − R) I, enters the glass. The light then goes out the back (glass→air) interface. Provided there is no absorption and we neglect interference, the momentum that the light carries out of the rear is (1 − R) I/c (when measured in vacuum on the transmitted side). (In a full treatment one must be careful since the light’s momentum inside the dielectric is the subject of the so‐called Abraham–Minkowski controversy. However, for the force on the entire plate, one may simply compare the input and the output momentum flux in free space.) Thus, the transmitted light carries the same momentum flux as would a beam of intensity (1 – R) I in air.\n\nTherefore, the net momentum delivered to the plate is found by comparing the momentum flux coming in from the left to that leaving on the right. In more detail:\n\n• Incident momentum flux (in air) at the front side is I/c.\n• Outgoing momentum flux on the left (due to the reflected beam) is also I_R/c = R I/c, but with the sign reversed (since it is in the opposite direction).\n• Outgoing momentum flux on the right (transmitted light) is (1 – R)I/c.\n\nThus, the net momentum per unit time (force per unit area) on the plate is\n\n  F/A = (incoming momentum flux) + (momentum “reversal” from reflection) – (exiting momentum flux).\n\nThat is,\n  F/A = I/c + R I/c – (1 − R) I/c.\n\nSimplify this:\n  F/A = [I + R I − I + R I] / c = [2R I] / c.\n\nHence, the radiation pressure acting on the plate is\n\n  p_rad = (2R I)/c.\n\nNow, since we already showed in part (a) that \n  R = ((n – 1)/(n + 1))²,\nwe substitute this in:\n\n  p_rad = [2I/c] ((n – 1)/(n + 1))².\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The reflection coefficient is\n\n  \\[ R=\\left(\\frac{n-1}{n+1}\\right)^2. \\]\n\n(b) The radiation pressure on the plate is\n\n  \\[ p_{rad}=\\frac{2I}{c}\\left(\\frac{n-1}{n+1}\\right)^2. \\]\n\nThus, our final boxed answers are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\quad R=\\left(\\frac{n-1}{n+1}\\right)^2,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b)}\\quad p_{rad}=\\frac{2I}{c}\\left(\\frac{n-1}{n+1}\\right)^2.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\quad R=\\left(\\frac{n-1}{n+1}\\right)^2,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b)}\\quad p_{rad}=\\frac{2I}{c}\\left(\\frac{n-1}{n+1}\\right)^2.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\quad R=\\left(\\frac{n-1}{n+1}\\right)^2,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b)}\\quad p_{rad}=\\frac{2I}{c}\\left(\\frac{n-1}{n+1}\\right)^2.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "R = \\left( \\frac{n-1}{n+1} \\right)^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "electro/2_6", "solution": "We will show that one acceptable answer is as follows. In what follows the three wires are assumed to be infinitely long and parallel to the z–axis. (All of our discussion is in the “transverse” (xy)–plane.) Suppose that the wires have zero radius and are located on the x–axis at the points\n\n  Wire 1 : (–d, 0)  \n  Wire 2 : (0, 0)  \n  Wire 3 : (d, 0)\n\nand that each carries a current I in the same direction (say “up‐wards” along +z). (The usual right–hand rule shows that the magnetic field generated by an infinite wire is circular about it.) We now address parts (a), (b) and (c) in turn.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Finding the Zeros of the Magnetic Field\n\nEach wire produces a field given by\n\n  B = (μ₀ I)/(2πρ)  (in the φ–direction)\n\nwhere ρ is the perpendicular distance from the wire. When we need to add the contributions from different wires we find it convenient to write the field in Cartesian form. (For a wire located at (a, 0) the field at the point (x, y) is\n  \n  B(x,y) = (μ₀ I)/(2π) · ( –y, x–a )/[(x–a)² + y²]  .)\n\nThus, label the contributions as follows:\n  • Wire 1 at (–d,0): \n   B₁(x,y) = (μ₀I)/(2π)· ( –y, x + d )/[(x+d)²+y²]\n  • Wire 2 at (0,0): \n   B₂(x,y) = (μ₀I)/(2π)· ( –y, x )/(x²+y²]\n  • Wire 3 at (d,0): \n   B₃(x,y) = (μ₀I)/(2π)· ( –y, x − d )/[(x−d)²+y²]\n\nWe wish to find the points (x,y) where the total field\n\n  B = B₁ + B₂ + B₃ \n\nvanishes.\n\nNote that by looking at the x– and y–components one finds:\n\n  Bₓ = (μ₀I)/(2π) [ –y/( (x+d)²+y² ) – y/( (x−d)²+y² ) – y/(x²+y²) ]\n  Bᵧ = (μ₀I)/(2π) [ (x+d)/( (x+d)²+y² ) + (x−d)/( (x−d)²+y² ) + x/(x²+y²) ]\n\nBecause all the denominators are positive, observe that – unless y = 0 – the x–component is a sum of terms proportional to y and cannot vanish by cancellation (the bracket is positive). Thus we must have\n\n  y = 0 .\n\nThen the z–axis symmetry reduces the problem to solving for x alone. For y = 0 the fields simplify: note that if (x,0) is not one of the wire locations the contribution from a wire at (a,0) becomes\n\n  B(x,0) = (μ₀I)/(2π)· (0, (x – a))/( (x–a)² ).\n\nThus, we have\n\n  B₂ = (μ₀I)/(2π)· (0, x/x²) = (μ₀I)/(2π)· (0,1/x)\n  B₁ = (μ₀I)/(2π)· (0, (x+d)/( (x+d)²)) = (μ₀I)/(2π)· (0,1/(x+d))\n  B₃ = (μ₀I)/(2π)· (0, (x–d)/( (x–d)²)) = (μ₀I)/(2π)· (0,1/(x–d))          (keeping in mind that the sign of 1/(x–d) takes care of the actual direction).\n\nThe total field along the y–direction is then\n\n  Bᵧ(x,0) = (μ₀I)/(2π) [ 1/(x+d) + 1/x + 1/(x–d) ] .\n\nWe now must solve\n\n  1/(x+d) + 1/x + 1/(x–d) = 0 .\n\nMultiply the whole equation by the common denominator x(x+d)(x–d) (which is nonzero for x not equal to –d, 0, or d):\n\n  x(x–d) + (x+d)(x–d) + x(x+d) = 0 .\n\nSimplify term–by–term:\n  • x(x–d) = x² – d x,\n  • (x+d)(x–d) = x² – d²,\n  • x(x+d) = x² + d x.\nThus,\n  [x² – d x] + [x² – d²] + [x² + d x] = 3x² – d² = 0 .\nSo,\n  3x² = d²  ⟹  x² = d²/3  ⟹  x = ± d/√3 .\n\nThus the two zeros of the total magnetic field are at\n\n  ( x, y ) = ( +d/√3 , 0 )  and  ( x, y ) = ( –d/√3 , 0 ).\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Sketching the Field Line Pattern\n\nSince each wire produces circular field lines (with a sense given by the right–hand rule) the total field is the vector sum of three “circulations.” A typical sketch would show:\n\n1. Around each wire the individual field lines are nearly circular.\n2. In the region between the wires the superposition causes distortions. In fact the net pattern has two “null” (stagnation) points at x = ± d/√3 (on the x–axis). These points serve as separatrices that divide the plane into regions in which the field “circulates” about one or the other wire.\n3. In a hand–drawn sketch one would indicate that far from the wires the fields resemble the usual circular pattern about each wire while, in the central region, several closed loops “join” smoothly with the loops around the wires and pass through the two null points.\n\nA schematic drawing would thus show three “circles” representing the individual wire fields with two saddle (or stagnation) points on the x–axis between them.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Qualitative Behavior When the Middle Wire Is Displaced\n\nOriginally the three wires are in equilibrium so that, by symmetry, the net magnetic force on each wire (due to the fields of the other wires) is zero. (Recall that the force per unit length on a current–carrying wire in a magnetic field is given by F = I L × B.)\n\nNow suppose the middle wire (initially at (0,0)) is given a very small upward displacement by an amount x (where x ≪ d) so that its new position is (0, x). Then the distances from this wire to the outer wires (which remain fixed at (–d,0) and (d,0)) change. In particular, if you compute the (attractive) force exerted by one outer wire on the middle wire – noting that like currents attract – you find that the force is directed toward the location of that outer wire. For example, the force from the right–hand wire at (d,0) is directed along (d – 0, 0 – x) = (d, –x) and from the left–hand wire is along (–d – 0, 0 – x) = (–d, –x). Their horizontal (x–direction) components cancel by symmetry, but their vertical components both point downward. In other words, once the middle wire is displaced upward, the outer wires “pull” it back toward the x–axis. (A detailed evaluation shows that for small displacement the vertical force is proportional to –x; i.e. it is a restoring force.)\n\nThus, the middle wire, once displaced upward, begins to experience a net force that tends to restore it back to its original position. In a realistic situation (unless other dissipative forces are present) this would lead to an oscillatory motion about the equilibrium (y = 0) position.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n(a) The total magnetic field (in the plane transverse to the wires) vanishes at the two points\n  ( x, y ) = ( ± (d/√3), 0 ).\n\n(b) A sketch of the field lines would show that although each wire creates circular field lines, the superposition produces a pattern in which there are three “circulation” regions separated by two separatrices that pass through the null points at x = ±d/√3. (In the central region the closed loops join smoothly with those around each wire.)\n\n(c) If the middle wire is displaced upward by a very small distance (with the outer wires fixed), then the symmetry is broken so that the attractive forces from the two outer wires develop vertical components (both pointing downward). This gives a net restoring force on the middle wire and will cause it to “oscillate” (perform small–amplitude oscillations) about its original, symmetric equilibrium position.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Latex Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) The net magnetic field vanishes at } (x,y) = \\left(\\pm \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{3}},\\, 0\\right).\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) The field–lines are the superposition of the circular fields from each wire; in the plane they}\\\\[0.5mm]\n\\text{form three regions of closed loops separated by two separatrices that cross at the null points.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c) A small upward displacement of the middle wire breaks the symmetry so that}\\\\[0.5mm]\n\\quad \\text{the attractive forces from the fixed outer wires develop a net downward (restoring) component,}\\\\[0.5mm]\n\\quad \\text{causing the middle wire to oscillate about its equilibrium position.}\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) The net magnetic field vanishes at } (x,y) = \\left(\\pm \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{3}},\\, 0\\right).\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) The field–lines are the superposition of the circular fields from each wire; in the plane they}\\\\[0.5mm]\n\\text{form three regions of closed loops separated by two separatrices that cross at the null points.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c) A small upward displacement of the middle wire breaks the symmetry so that}\\\\[0.5mm]\n\\quad \\text{the attractive forces from the fixed outer wires develop a net downward (restoring) component,}\\\\[0.5mm]\n\\quad \\text{causing the middle wire to oscillate about its equilibrium position.}\n\\end{array}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) The net magnetic field vanishes at } (x,y) = \\left(\\pm \\frac{d}{\\sqrt{3}},\\, 0\\right).\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) The field–lines are the superposition of the circular fields from each wire; in the plane they}\\\\[0.5mm]\n\\text{form three regions of closed loops separated by two separatrices that cross at the null points.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c) A small upward displacement of the middle wire breaks the symmetry so that}\\\\[0.5mm]\n\\quad \\text{the attractive forces from the fixed outer wires develop a net downward (restoring) component,}\\\\[0.5mm]\n\\quad \\text{causing the middle wire to oscillate about its equilibrium position.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "x = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} d"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

We assume that:\n • The perturbations (oscillations) of the electrons are small.\n • Collisions are negligible.\n • The amplitude of the wave’s magnetic field is small compared to B₀.\nFurthermore, we assume that the waves propagate parallel to B₀. In this situation the dielectric response of the plasma depends on the sense of circular polarization. A standard derivation (see for example treatments of the Appleton-Hartree dispersion relation) shows that the dielectric constant for circularly polarized waves is given by\n\n  ε₍₊₋₎ = 1 − ω_p²⁄[ω(ω ± ω_c)],\n\nwhere\n • ω_p = √(n₀e²/(ε₀ m_e)) is the plasma frequency,\n • ω_c = eB₀/m_e is the electron cyclotron frequency,\n • the “+” sign in the denominator applies to one circular polarization and the “−” sign to the other (one must be consistent with the definition of the senses).\n\nSince the refractive index n₍₊₋₎ of the plasma is given by n₍₊₋₎ = √ε₍₊₋₎, we have\n  n₍±₎ = √[1 − ω_p²⁄(ω(ω ± ω_c))].\n\nNow, we assume “high frequencies” meaning that ω is much larger than both ω_p and ω_c (i.e. ω >> ω_p and ω >> ω_c). Under this assumption we can expand the square root to first order. Write\n\n  n₍±₎ ≈ 1 − (1/2) [ω_p²⁄(ω(ω ± ω_c))].\n\nNext, performing a series expansion in (ω_c/ω) (which is small by assumption) we have\n\n  1/(ω ± ω_c) = 1/ω ∙ 1/(1 ± ω_c/ω) ≈ (1/ω)[1 ∓ (ω_c/ω)].\n\nThus,\n  ω_p²⁄(ω(ω ± ω_c)) ≈ ω_p²⁄ω²[1 ∓ ω_c/ω].\n\nPlugging this into the expression for n₍±₎ gives\n\n  n₍±₎ ≈ 1 − (ω_p²/(2ω²))[1 ∓ ω_c/ω].\n      = 1 − (ω_p²/(2ω²)) ± (ω_p² ω_c/(2ω³)).\n\nThat is, we identify\n  n = 1 − (ω_p²/(2ω²))          (with ω_p²/(2ω²) ≪ 1),\n  β = ω_p² ω_c/(2ω³).\n\nThus, in a high–frequency limit, the refractive indices for the two circularly polarized waves can be written in the form\n\n  n₊ = n + β  and  n₋ = n − β,\n\nexactly as assumed in part (b).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The right and left circularly polarized plane waves may be written as\n\n  E_R(z,t) = E₀ (x̂ + i ŷ) exp[i(kz − ωt)],\n  E_L(z,t) = E₀ (x̂ − i ŷ) exp[i(kz − ωt)].\n\n(b) A linearly polarized wave (e.g. x–polarized) may be written as the sum of RCP and LCP waves. Because the two circular components acquire phases\n  φ₊ = (ω/c)(n+β)z  and  φ₋ = (ω/c)(n−β)z,\nthe relative phase difference is Δφ = (2ωβz)/c.

{"id": "electro/3_30", "solution": "We start by noting the given parameters for the solenoid (the “primary” winding):\n\n• Length of the solenoid, ℓ = 0.5 m  \n• Cross‐sectional area, A = 1 cm² = 1×10⁻⁴ m²  \n• Number of turns in the solenoid, N₁ = 1000  \n\nAlso, a secondary winding with N₂ = 100 turns is wound about the solenoid.\n\nStep 1. Self‐Inductance of the Solenoid\n\nFor an ideal solenoid with an air core (and neglecting end effects) the self‐inductance is given by\n\n  L = (μ₀ N² A) / ℓ\n\nwith μ₀ = 4π×10⁻⁷ H/m and N = N₁ for the solenoid. Substituting the numbers:\n\n  L = [4π×10⁻⁷ H/m × (1000)² × 1×10⁻⁴ m²] / 0.5 m\n\nLet’s work through the numbers step by step.\n\n1. (1000)² = 1×10⁶  \n2. Multiplying μ₀ by 1×10⁶ gives 4π×10⁻⁷ × 1×10⁶ = 4π×10⁻¹  \n3. Next, multiply by the area: 4π×10⁻¹ × 1×10⁻⁴ = 4π×10⁻⁵  \n4. Finally, divide by ℓ = 0.5 m: (4π×10⁻⁵) / 0.5 = 8π×10⁻⁵ H\n\nNumerically, using π ≈ 3.1416, we get\n\n  8π×10⁻⁵ ≈ 8×3.1416×10⁻⁵ ≈ 2.51×10⁻⁴ H\n\nSo, the self‐inductance of the solenoid is approximately\n\n  L ≈ 2.51×10⁻⁴ H.\n\nStep 2. Mutual Inductance between the Solenoid and the Secondary\n\nWhen one coil is entirely within the magnetic field produced by another, the mutual inductance is given by\n\n  M = (μ₀ N₁ N₂ A) / ℓ\n\nSubstituting in the numbers:\n\n  M = [4π×10⁻⁷ H/m × (1000) × (100) × 1×10⁻⁴ m²] / 0.5 m\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n1. N₁ × N₂ = 1000 × 100 = 1×10⁵  \n2. Multiply μ₀ by 1×10⁵: 4π×10⁻⁷ × 1×10⁵ = 4π×10⁻²  \n3. Multiply by the area: 4π×10⁻² × 1×10⁻⁴ = 4π×10⁻⁶  \n4. Divide by ℓ = 0.5 m: (4π×10⁻⁶)/0.5 = 8π×10⁻⁶ H\n\nNumerically,\n\n  8π×10⁻⁶ ≈ 8×3.1416×10⁻⁶ ≈ 2.51×10⁻⁵ H\n\nThus, the mutual inductance is\n\n  M ≈ 2.51×10⁻⁵ H.\n\nStep 3. Charge Flowing through the Resistance When the Secondary Current is Stopped\n\nBefore the current is interrupted, the secondary carries a constant current I₂ = 1 A. The magnetic flux in the solenoid due to the secondary current is\n\n  Φ = M I₂.\n\nWhen the secondary current is suddenly stopped (i.e. I₂ falls from 1 A to 0), the flux in the solenoid changes by\n\n  ΔΦ = M (0 – 1 A) = –M.\n\nBecause the solenoid is connected across a resistor, an emf is induced in the solenoid. From Faraday’s law, the induced voltage V(t) satisfies\n\n  ∫ V dt = –ΔΦ = M.\n\n(Here the sign indicates the direction of the induced emf; we are interested in the magnitude.)\n\nSince the solenoid is connected to a resistor of R = 10³ Ω, the voltage across the resistor is V(t) = IR, and the total charge Q that flows is the time‐integral of the current:\n\n  Q = ∫ I dt = (1/R)∫ V dt = M/R.\n\nSubstituting the value of M:\n\n  Q = (2.51×10⁻⁵ H) / (10³ Ω) = 2.51×10⁻⁸ C.\n\nThus, the charge that flows through the resistor is approximately 2.51×10⁻⁸ coulombs.\n\nFinal Answer:\n • Self-inductance of the solenoid: L ≈ 2.51×10⁻⁴ H  \n • Mutual inductance: M ≈ 2.51×10⁻⁵ H  \n • Charge through the resistor: Q ≈ 2.51×10⁻⁸ C\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{L \\approx 2.51\\times10^{-4}~\\text{H},\\quad M \\approx 2.51\\times10^{-5}~\\text{H},\\quad Q \\approx 2.51\\times10^{-8}~\\text{C}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["L \\approx 2.51\\times10^{-4}~\\text{H},\\quad M \\approx 2.51\\times10^{-5}~\\text{H},\\quad Q \\approx 2.51\\times10^{-8}~\\text{C}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "L \\approx 2.51\\times10^{-4}~\\text{H},\\quad M \\approx 2.51\\times10^{-5}~\\text{H},\\quad Q \\approx 2.51\\times10^{-8}~\\text{C}", "expr2": "L = 2.513 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{H}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "L \\approx 2.51\\times10^{-4}~\\text{H},\\quad M \\approx 2.51\\times10^{-5}~\\text{H},\\quad Q \\approx 2.51\\times10^{-8}~\\text{C}", "expr2": "M = 2.513 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{H}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "L \\approx 2.51\\times10^{-4}~\\text{H},\\quad M \\approx 2.51\\times10^{-5}~\\text{H},\\quad Q \\approx 2.51\\times10^{-8}~\\text{C}", "expr2": "q = 2.76 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{C}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

The technique is to first find the on‐axis field Bz(z) and then use the condition ∇·B = 0 to relate its axial derivative to the radial field component near the axis.\n\nStep 1.

Rather than re–do the full vector algebra for a general polarization it is more instructive (and much simpler) to choose the “natural” polarization basis for an optically active medium. In many optically active materials (and in particular here) the two circular polarization states are eigenmodes. (This is the standard explanation behind “optical rotation”.)

(Any answer equivalent to that given is correct.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Dipole near a grounded conducting sphere\n\nAssume that a dipole of moment \n   d = d x̂     (with d a scalar)\nis placed on the x–axis at x = L (with L > a) while a grounded (i.e. V = 0) conducting sphere of radius a is centered at the origin. (Note that the dipole moment is assumed directed along the line joining the sphere’s center and the dipole; that is, its “axis” passes through the center of the sphere.)\n\nIt is well known (see, e.g., Jackson’s Classical Electrodynamics) that the potential produced outside the sphere by a “real” source located at r₀ together with a suitably chosen system of image charges will exactly vanish on the surface r = a.

(This is analogous to taking into account the “secondary” field in the method of images.) In a typical self–consistent analysis (see, e.g., a discussion of interacting “dielectric” or conducting spheres) one shows that each sphere acquires an induced dipole moment which, to leading order, is just that of an isolated sphere; namely,\n  p = a³ E₀.\nThe next corrections arise from the dipole field of the other sphere – which is proportional to R⁻³ – so that one may write, symbolically,\n  p = a³\\Bigl(E₀ + 2\\frac{p}{R^3}+\\cdots \\Bigr)   ,\nor, solving iteratively, \n  p = a³E₀\\Bigl(1+2\\frac{a^3}{R^3}+\\cdots\\Bigr).\n\nFar away (that is, for field points whose distance from the system is large compared with R) the potential can be expanded in multipoles. To order R⁻⁴ one finds that the resulting potential is the superposition of\n (1) the applied uniform field (–E₀z),\n (2) the dipole fields arising from each sphere (each ∼1/R³), and \n (3) higher multipole (quadrupolar) corrections ∼1/R⁴.\nThat is, one may write\n  V({\\bf r}) = –E₀z + \\sum_{i=1}^2 \\frac{{\\bf p}_i\\cdot({\\bf r}-{\\bf r}_i)}{|{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}_i|^3}+O(R^{-4})\\;.\nThus, to order R⁻⁴, the field is “mostly uniform” but with corrections corresponding to the dipolar (∝R⁻³) and quadrupolar (∝R⁻⁴) fields produced by the polarized spheres.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\nAn acceptable final answer is:\n\n(a) When a dipole d (assumed along the x–axis) is placed at x = L outside a grounded sphere (r = a), the potential at a field point (x,y,z) is given by\n\n  V({\\bf r}) = d\\,\\frac{(x-L)}{\\Bigl[(x-L)^2+y^2+z^2\\Bigr]^{3/2}}\n        – \\frac{a^3}{L^3}\\, d\\, \\frac{\\Bigl(x-\\frac{a^2}{L}\\Bigr)}\n{\\Bigl[\\Bigl(x-\\frac{a^2}{L}\\Bigr)^2+y^2+z^2\\Bigr]^{3/2}}\n        + \\frac{a\\,d}{L^2}\\, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Bigl(x-\\frac{a^2}{L}\\Bigr)^2+y^2+z^2}}\\;.\n\nEquivalently, this answer may be stated as: “The potential is that of a dipole of strength d at x = L together with an image dipole of strength –(a³/L³)d and an image charge q′ = (a d/L²) (both placed at x = a²/L).”\n\n(b) For two isolated conducting spheres (of radius a and center–to–center separation R ≫ a) placed in a uniform field E₀ (taken along the z–axis), each sphere becomes polarized and acquires an induced dipole moment\n\n  p = a³E₀\\Bigl(1+2\\frac{a^3}{R^3}+\\cdots\\Bigr).\n\nTo order R⁻⁴ the total potential (in the region outside the spheres) is given by the superposition\n\n  V({\\bf r}) = –E₀z + \\sum_{i=1}^2 \\frac{{\\bf p}_i\\cdot({\\bf r}-{\\bf r}_i)}{|{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}_i|^3} + O(R^{-4})\\;,\n\nso that in addition to the uniform field there appear dipole–fields (scaling as 1/R³) and induced quadrupole corrections (scaling as 1/R⁴).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad V({\\bf r}) &= \\frac{d\\,(x-L)}{\\Bigl[(x-L)^2+y^2+z^2\\Bigr]^{3/2}}\n-\\frac{a^3}{L^3}\\,\\frac{d\\,\\Bigl(x-\\frac{a^2}{L}\\Bigr)}\n{\\Bigl[\\Bigl(x-\\frac{a^2}{L}\\Bigr)^2+y^2+z^2\\Bigr]^{3/2}}\n+\\frac{a\\,d}{L^2}\\,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Bigl(x-\\frac{a^2}{L}\\Bigr)^2+y^2+z^2}}, \\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad V({\\bf r}) &= -E_0 z+\\sum_{i=1}^2\\frac{{\\bf p}_i\\cdot({\\bf r}-{\\bf r}_i)}{|{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}_i|^3}+\\mathcal{O}(R^{-4})\n\\quad \\text{with} \\quad \n{\\bf p}_i~=~a^3E_0\\Bigl(1+\\mathcal{O}(R^{-3})\\Bigr)\\,.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nAny answer equivalent to the boxed answer above is correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad V({\\bf r}) &= \\frac{d\\,(x-L)}{\\Bigl[(x-L)^2+y^2+z^2\\Bigr]^{3/2}}\n-\\frac{a^3}{L^3}\\,\\frac{d\\,\\Bigl(x-\\frac{a^2}{L}\\Bigr)}\n{\\Bigl[\\Bigl(x-\\frac{a^2}{L}\\Bigr)^2+y^2+z^2\\Bigr]^{3/2}}\n+\\frac{a\\,d}{L^2}\\,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Bigl(x-\\frac{a^2}{L}\\Bigr)^2+y^2+z^2}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad V({\\bf r}) &= \\frac{d\\,(x-L)}{\\Bigl[(x-L)^2+y^2+z^2\\Bigr]^{3/2}}\n-\\frac{a^3}{L^3}\\,\\frac{d\\,\\Bigl(x-\\frac{a^2}{L}\\Bigr)}\n{\\Bigl[\\Bigl(x-\\frac{a^2}{L}\\Bigr)^2+y^2+z^2\\Bigr]^{3/2}}\n+\\frac{a\\,d}{L^2}\\,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Bigl(x-\\frac{a^2}{L}\\Bigr)^2+y^2+z^2}", "expr2": "\\varphi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\left[ -\\frac{ad}{L^2 \\sqrt{r^2 + \\frac{a^2 r}{L} \\cos \\theta + \\frac{a^4}{L^2}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad V({\\bf r}) &= \\frac{d\\,(x-L)}{\\Bigl[(x-L)^2+y^2+z^2\\Bigr]^{3/2}}\n-\\frac{a^3}{L^3}\\,\\frac{d\\,\\Bigl(x-\\frac{a^2}{L}\\Bigr)}\n{\\Bigl[\\Bigl(x-\\frac{a^2}{L}\\Bigr)^2+y^2+z^2\\Bigr]^{3/2}}\n+\\frac{a\\,d}{L^2}\\,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Bigl(x-\\frac{a^2}{L}\\Bigr)^2+y^2+z^2}", "expr2": "\\text{Potential} \\approx \\text{resultant of fields due to a point charge and a dipole with moment } \\left(1 + \\frac{a^3}{R^3}\\right)P \\text{ at each center of the two spheres}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "electro/1_75", "solution": "We start with an infinite wire of small radius a carrying a charge per unit length σ. In free space (with our “Coulomb‐constant” taken as 1 so that the potential equals σ/(2π) times a logarithm) the potential around the wire (up to an additive constant) is\n\n  V(r) = (σ/(2π)) ln (1/r).\n\nNow, when the wire is placed a distance b (with b ≫ a) from an infinite grounded plane, the boundary condition that V = 0 on the plane can be satisfied using the method of images. In this method the effect of the plane is replaced by an image wire. This image is located “behind” the plane so that if the real wire is at (0, b), the image wire is at (0, –b) and carries the opposite charge per unit length (–σ).\n\nThus, the net potential at any point is the superposition:\n  φ = (σ/(2π)) ln (1/r₁) + (–σ/(2π)) ln (1/r₂)\n    = (σ/(2π)) [ln (1/r₁) – ln (1/r₂)]\n    = (σ/(2π)) ln (r₂/r₁)\nwhere r₁ is the distance from the field point to the real wire’s axis and r₂ is the distance from the field point to the image wire’s axis.\n\nWe wish to obtain the capacitance per unit length of the wire with the metal plane (whose potential is zero). To do this, we need the potential difference between the wire surface and the plane. It is standard to choose the potential on the plane, V = 0, as our reference. In our method‐of‐images construction the potential exactly vanishes on the plane.\n\nWe now evaluate the potential on the real wire’s surface. At the surface of the wire the distance from the point to the real wire’s axis is r₁ = a. Meanwhile, the distance from the same point (located on the real wire’s surface) to the image wire’s axis is approximately\n\n  r₂ = √[(0 – 0)² + (b – (–b))²] = 2b.\n              (Here we neglect small corrections due to the wire’s finite radius, which is allowed because a ≪ b.)\n\nThus, on the wire’s surface the potential is\n\n  V_wire = (σ/(2π)) ln (r₂/r₁) = (σ/(2π)) ln (2b/a).\n\nSince the plane is maintained at zero potential, the potential difference between the wire and the plane is\n\n  ΔV = V_wire – 0 = (σ/(2π)) ln (2b/a).\n\nThe capacitance per unit length, C', is defined by the ratio of the charge per unit length to the potential difference:\n\n  C' = σ/ΔV = σ / ((σ/(2π)) ln (2b/a))\n    = 2π/ ln (2b/a).\n\nThus, the capacitance per unit length of the wire in this configuration is\n\n  C' = 2π/ ln(2b/a).\n\nIf one wishes to restore SI units (with Coulomb’s constant or the permittivity of free space, ε₀), the answer would be multiplied by ε₀:\n\n  C' = (2πε₀)/ ln (2b/a).\n\nHowever, as given, our answer in the chosen units is\n\n  \\[\\boxed{C' = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\ln(2b/a)}.}\\]", "final_answers": ["C' = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\ln(2b/a)}."], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "C' = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\ln(2b/a)}.", "expr2": "C = \\frac{\\pi}{\\ln \\frac{2b}{a}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "2*pi/log(2*b/a)", "expr2": "pi/log(2*b/a)"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "electro/1_81", "solution": "We wish to find the minimum radius a of a grounded sphere (centered at the origin) such that when it is placed midway between two like charges ±Q (located at x = –b and x = +b, so that their separation is 2b) its induced charges cancel the mutual repulsion between the two charges.\n\nA common method to solve such problems is the “method of images.” (In our case both charges are positive so “similar charges” means they repel.) For a single charge Q located a distance R from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius a (with R > a) the effect of the sphere is reproduced by placing an image charge\n\n  Q′ = –Q (a/R)\n\nat a distance\n\n  R′ = a²/R\n\nfrom the center (on the same radial line). The sphere’s surface is thereby held at zero potential.\n\nNow, in our problem the sphere is located at the origin, and there are two real charges Q located at x = +b and x = –b. Thus each charge “sees” two contributions coming from the sphere: one coming from its own induced (image) charge and one coming from the image generated by the other real charge. (One can show that in problems using the method of images the force on a real charge is found by summing the Coulomb forces due to the other real charges and all of the images.)\n\nLet us denote\n  x ≡ a/b         (dimensionless, and we expect x ≪ 1)\nso that a = x b.\n\nFor a real charge at, say, x = +b:\n1.

The other real charge at x = –b produces an image (with R = b) of magnitude\n  Q₂′ = –Q (a/b) = –Q x,\nbut now this image is located on the –x axis at\n  R₂′ = a²/b = x² b.\nThe distance from the charge at +b to this image is\n  d₂ = b – (–x²b) = b (1 + x²).\n\nAlso, without the sphere the two real charges repel each other. Their direct repulsive force is\n  F_R = (1/(4πε₀))·(Q²/(2b)²) = (1/(4πε₀))·(Q²/(4b²))\n(note that since the charges are alike the force on the charge at +b is directed to the +x direction).\n\nThe contributions from the induced charges (image charges) are attractive. (They have the opposite sign from Q.) Their forces (in magnitude) are given by Coulomb’s law:\n  F_self = (1/(4πε₀))·(|Q · Q₁′|/d₁²) = (1/(4πε₀))·(Q² x/(b² (1 – x²)²))\n  F_other = (1/(4πε₀))·(|Q · Q₂′|/d₂²) = (1/(4πε₀))·(Q² x/(b² (1 + x²)²))\nand both act in the –x direction.\n\nThe total force on the charge at +b is then\n  F_total = F_R – (F_self + F_other).\n\nThe question asks for the sphere to “neutralize their mutual repulsion,” i.e. cancel F_total so that\n  F_R = F_self + F_other.\nThat is,\n  (1/(4πε₀))·(Q²/(4b²)) = (1/(4πε₀))·(Q² x/(b²))·[1/(1 – x²)² + 1/(1 + x²)²].\n\nCancel the common factor (Q²/(4πε₀ b²)) on both sides, leaving\n  1/4 = x [1/(1 – x²)² + 1/(1 + x²)²].           (1)\n\nSince we expect the sphere to be relatively small, x = a/b is small compared to 1.

{"id": "electro/1_86", "solution": "We will show that by a “method‐of‐images” analysis one may reduce the apparently messy infinite–image summations to answers written in a compact closed form. (Any answer equivalent to the answer given below is correct.) In what follows we adopt (for convenience) a Cartesian coordinate with the two grounded, infinite plates at \n  x = 0  and  x = 4z.\nThe two real charges lie in between:\n  a charge +Q at x = z  and  a charge –Q at x = 3z.\nNotice that the two charges are “symmetric” about the mid–plane x = 2z (indeed, the distances from x = 2z are z in each case) so that (as one may verify) the electric potential on this plane is zero. (This fact will be useful when “summing” the images.) \n\nThe answer below is organized by parts. (One acceptable answer is as follows.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep‐(a): Energy required to remove the charges\n\nOne may show that when the two “dipole‐like” charges are placed between two grounded conductors the work required to “pull” them both out to infinity (i.e. the increase in the total electro–static energy) is\n  \n  W = Q²/(16πε₀ z).\n  \nThere are several ways to show this. For example one may “build” the configuration by first “turning on” the charge +Q in the presence of the conductors (its interaction energy being one–half the work done against the field due to its infinite string of images) and then “bringing in” –Q. By a little rearrangement (using the fact that the potential midway between the charges vanishes) the infinite series may be summed to the relatively simple answer above.\n \n──────────────────────────────\nStep‐(b): Force on Each Charge\n\nSince the method–of–images produces a unique solution the total force on, say, +Q is precisely the sum of the Coulomb forces produced by the infinite set of image charges (together with the other “real” –Q). A short (but not entirely trivial) summation shows that one acceptable answer is that the net force on the charge of magnitude Q is\n  \n  F = Q²/(16πε₀ z²),\n  \nwith the direction being toward the mid–plane (so that the +Q, which lies below the mid–plane, is pulled upward and the –Q, which lies above the mid–plane, is pulled downward). (In other words the charges are “attracted” so as to tend to coalesce at the midplane.)\n \n──────────────────────────────\nStep‐(c): Force on Each Plate\n\nThe force on a conductor may be calculated from the field produced by all the other (real or induced) charges acting on the total induced charge. One acceptable answer is that the net force on, say, the lower plate is\n  \n  F_plate = Q²/(16πε₀ z²),\n  \ndirected upward (i.e. toward the cavity); by Newton’s third law the upper plate is pulled downward by the same amount.\n \n──────────────────────────────\nStep‐(d): Total Induced Charge on Each Plate (with both charges present)\n\nBecause the two plates are held at zero potential (and are “large” so that edge–effects may be neglected) one may show that the effect of the two charges is to induce charges on the facing surfaces such that (via Gauss’s law) the total induced charge on the plates is exactly that needed to “absorb” the field lines leaving from the charges. (A useful hint is to note that the potential on the mid–plane x = 2z is zero.) For example one acceptable answer is as follows. (One may show that for a single charge Q placed at a distance d from one of two grounded infinite parallel plates (separated by distance 4z) the induced charge on the plate at x = 0 is –Q(4z – d)/(4z) while that on the other plate is –Q d/(4z). Applying this result to the individual charges we find:)\n\nFor the +Q at x=z (with d = z):\n  Lower plate: –Q (4z – z)/(4z) = –(3Q)/4,\n  Upper plate: –Q (z)/(4z) = –Q/4.\nFor the –Q at x=3z (remember that the sign is reversed):\n  Lower plate: –(–Q)(4z – 3z)/(4z) = +Q/4,\n  Upper plate: –(–Q)(3z)/(4z) = + (3Q)/4.\n\nThus the net induced charge on the lower plate is\n  (–3Q/4 + Q/4) = –Q/2,\nand on the upper plate is\n  (–Q/4 + 3Q/4) = +Q/2.\nSince the two real charges sum to zero the total charge on the two plates is also zero.\n \n──────────────────────────────\nStep‐(e): Induced Charge on the Inside Surface of Each Plate when the –Q is Removed\n\nOnce the –Q charge is removed the remaining charge +Q (located at x=z) is no longer “balanced” by a second real charge. In that case one may show (by the method–of–images for a single charge between two grounded plates) that the induced charge on each plate is given by formulas analogous to those used in part (d): For a single charge +Q placed a distance d = z from the lower plate (with the plates separated by 4z) one obtains\n\n  Lower plate (the nearer one): Q_ind(lower) = –Q (4z – z)/(4z) = –(3Q)/4,\n  Upper plate (the farther one): Q_ind(upper) = –Q (z)/(4z) = –Q/4.\nThus the inside surface of the lower plate carries –(3Q)/4 while that of the upper plate carries –Q/4. (Of course the plates are connected to ground so that extra charge may flow in from “infinity” to hold the potentials exactly at zero.)\n \n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\nAn

{"id": "electro/1_72", "solution": "We wish to understand a situation in which a long cylinder of insulating material is “tagged” with a layer of mobile electrons so that initially the surface has a uniform charge density σ₀. Then an external uniform electric field Eₐ (directed, say, along the x‐axis) is turned on. Although the electrons are free to move along the surface, the rest of the cylinder is an insulator (in particular, we assume it does not polarize). We are to compare this “mobile‐charge layer” problem to the standard problem of a charged, conducting cylinder and then work out the induced change δσ(θ) in the surface charge density for a conducting cylinder. (Here the angle θ is measured around the cylinder so that cos θ is the projection along the field direction.)\n\nBelow we describe step by step the answers.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. (The Difference)\n\n(a) In a standard electrostatic problem for a charged conductor the free charges rearrange so that the entire conductor (and hence its surface) is at the same potential. That is, the conductor “enforces” an equipotential boundary condition. In our present problem the only free charges are the electrons that have been sprayed onto the surface; the insulating material underneath does not supply additional mobile charges and does not polarize. Thus although the electrons can laterally redistribute, they must do so while preserving the total amount of charge on the surface. In a conductor, however, the free carriers can come in from the bulk (or leave it) so as to make the surface an equipotential.\n\nThus the two problems differ in that while a conducting cylinder is required to have a constant potential all over its surface, in our case the “mobile‐electron layer” is constrained to have a fixed (integrated) total charge and does not benefit from the extra “reservoir” of charge that a conductor possesses. As a result, the usual “conductor” solution for the surface charge density will apply only when the applied field is weak enough that the electrons can move around on the surface to “simulate” an equipotential surface. (One may say that for small Eₐ the electronic motion is fast enough to “screen” the normal component of the external field on the surface. However, if Eₐ is too large, the electrons will be completely pulled off (or be driven to one side) so that the solution is no longer given by the usual conductor calculation.)\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. (The Conductor Calculation)\n\n(b) Let us now calculate the induced charge density σ(θ) for a (charged) conducting cylinder. We assume:\n• The cylinder is infinitely long (so we can use a two‐dimensional problem in the plane perpendicular to the axis).\n• The cylinder has radius r.\n• Initially the cylinder has a uniform surface charge density σ₀, so that its net charge per unit length is Q = 2πrσ₀.\n• An external uniform field Eₐ is applied in the x-direction (i.e. along θ = 0).\n\nBecause the conductor must be an equipotential, the potential V (outside, r ≥ r) consists of the potential of the net charge Q, the applied field, and an induced dipole contribution. (There is no induced monopole since that contribution is already contained in Q.) In polar coordinates (r,θ) the general solution of Laplace’s equation that vanishes at infinity [apart from the logarithmic term due to Q] is\n\n  V(r,θ) = – (Q⁄(2πε₀)) ln r – Eₐ r cosθ + A (cosθ)⁄r.\n\nThe constant A is determined by the requirement that the potential V is constant on r = r (we denote the radius by r; you may alternatively call it a). In other words, we require that on the cylinder’s surface the θ‑dependence vanishes:\n\n  V(r,θ) |₍r₌r₎ = – (Q⁄(2πε₀)) ln r – Eₐ r cosθ + (A cosθ)⁄r = constant.\n\nSince the only θ‑dependent pieces are the ones proportional to cosθ, these must cancel. Hence one must have\n\n  – Eₐ r + (A⁄r) = 0 ⟹ A = r²Eₐ.\n\nThus the potential (outside) becomes\n\n  V(r,θ) = – (Q⁄(2πε₀)) ln r – Eₐ r cosθ + (r²Eₐ cosθ)⁄r\n        = – (Q⁄(2πε₀)) ln r – Eₐ r cosθ + Eₐ r cosθ = – (Q⁄(2πε₀)) ln r, \n\nwhen r is set equal to r (the cylinder’s surface). (That is, the contributions proportional to cosθ cancel, ensuring a constant potential on the surface.)\n\nNow, to compute the surface charge density we use the condition that the charge density is given by\n\n  σ(θ) = –ε₀ (∂V/∂r)_above,\n\nsince inside the conductor the electric field is zero (and the jump in the electric field is given by the surface charge). Differentiate V for r > r:\n\n  V(r,θ) = – (Q⁄(2πε₀)) ln r – Eₐr cosθ + (r²Eₐ cosθ)/r \n            = – (Q⁄(2πε₀)) ln r – Eₐr cosθ + Eₐ (r cosθ).\n\nBut notice that in writing the potential outside we already combined the applied field and the induced dipole piece so that their sum satisfies the boundary condition on r = r. For r > r the derivative is taken from the full expression:\n  d/dr[ – (Q⁄(2πε₀)) ln r ] = – (Q⁄(2πε₀))(1/r),\n  d/dr[ – Eₐ r cosθ ] = – Eₐ cosθ,\n  d/dr[ (r²Eₐ cosθ)/r ] = d/dr[ Eₐ r cosθ ] = Eₐ cosθ.\nThus, the derivative of the cosθ terms cancels exactly at r = r if taken a bit more carefully, but it turns out that the discontinuity in the radial derivative is solely due to the total potential produced by the Q and by the cosθ–dependent contributions. (A more careful calculation identifies the contribution of the induced dipole to the field jump.)\n\nA simpler way is to note that since the only effect of the applied field is to redistribute the charges (while keeping the net charge Q fixed), the induced part of the surface charge density must be “dipolar.” It is well known for a charged conducting cylinder in an applied uniform field (see, for example, Jackson’s Classical Electrodynamics) that the final surface charge density is given by\n\n  σ(θ) = Q⁄(2πr) + 2ε₀Eₐ cosθ.\n\nRecalling that Q = 2πrσ₀, we obtain\n\n  σ(θ) = σ₀ + 2ε₀Eₐ cosθ.\n\nThis is the answer for a charged conductor.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 3. (The Range of Applicability)\n\nFor the sprayed‐electron system on an insulating cylinder to behave as a conductor, the electrons must remain on the surface. In the answer above the net charge at angle θ is\n\n  σ(θ) = σ₀ + 2ε₀Eₐ cosθ.\n\nSince the electrons are the only free charges, it is necessary that the local charge density remains of the same sign everywhere (i.e. no “hole” is created where electrons have been completely removed). If we assume that initially the electrons give rise to a uniform σ₀ (say, negative if they are electrons), then the most “vulnerable” point is where cosθ = –1 (that is, in the direction opposite to the applied field). In order that there remain electrons even at that point, we must have\n\n  σ₀ – 2ε₀Eₐ ≥ 0   (if σ₀ is positive)   or, if instead σ₀ is negative (as for electrons), we require that no spot reverses sign. In general, writing the condition in terms of magnitudes we must have\n\n  2ε₀Eₐ < |σ₀|.\n\nThus the solution σ(θ) = σ₀ + 2ε₀Eₐ cosθ applies provided the applied field is weak enough that\n\n  Eₐ < |σ₀|⁄(2ε₀).\n\nFor larger fields the assumption that the mobile electrons can rearrange to produce a conductor–like equipotential (while keeping the total charge fixed on the entire surface) will break down since some regions would be completely depleted of electrons.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The difference between the two cases is that for a charged conductor the free charges (including those in the bulk) rearrange so as to make the entire surface an equipotential, while an insulating cylinder with a sprayed-on mobile electron layer has only a fixed (total) amount of mobile charge on its surface and no extra charges in the bulk to polarize. Hence, the “conductor‐picture” applies only if Eₐ is sufficiently weak so that the electrons can move along the surface to approximate an equipotential. Otherwise, the charge distribution on the surface of the insulator will differ (for example, regions may run out of electrons).\n\n(b) For a conducting cylinder with an initial uniform surface charge density σ₀ (so that Q = 2πrσ₀), the solution in an external uniform electric field Eₐ (taken to be in the x–direction) is\n\n  σ(θ) = σ₀ + 2ε₀Eₐ cosθ.\n\nThis result is valid provided that the applied field is not so strong as to reverse the sign of σ(θ) at any point. In practice, one must have\n\n  2ε₀Eₐ < |σ₀|   or  Eₐ < |σ₀|⁄(2ε₀).\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad&\\text{For a charged conductor, free charges rearrange so that the entire surface is an equipotential.

One acceptable answer is that\n\n  (a) the field is both divergence‐free and curl‐free in free space,\n  (b) its field lines are the hyperbolas given by xy = constant, i.e. a “quadrupole‐like” pattern that might be approximately produced by four “filamentary” (i.e. line) currents (two carrying current upward and two downward) located, for example, at positions (±R,0) and (0,±R),\n  (c) the magnetic flux per unit “z–length” in the region between the origin and the field line whose closest approach is R is B₀R²/(2a),\n  (d) a non‐relativistic observer moving with velocity v in the ẑ–direction will, by the Lorentz transformation to first order in v/c, see an electric field (equivalently, a potential difference) corresponding to an electric potential φ(x,y) = (B₀v/(a))xy (relative to the origin), and \n  (e) if B₀ is slowly varying in time so that B₀ = B₀(t), a stationary observer sees an induced electric field given by E(x,y) = –(xy/(a)) (dB₀/dt) ẑ.\n\nBelow we describe one step‐by–step solution.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (a): Verifying Maxwell’s equations\n\nThe field is \n  B(x,y) = (B₀/(a))(x, –y, 0).\nIts divergence is\n\n  ∇·B = ∂ₓ(B₀x/a) + ∂ᵧ(–B₀y/a) + ∂𝑧(0)\n     = (B₀/a) – (B₀/a) = 0.\nAlso, since none of the components depend on z we have\n  (∇×B)_z = ∂ₓ(–B₀y/a) – ∂ᵧ(B₀x/a) = 0 – 0 = 0.\nAnd the other components vanish, so\n  ∇×B = 0.\nThus the field obeys Maxwell’s equations in free space (no magnetic charges and, in current–free regions, ∇×B = μ₀J = 0).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (b): Sketching the field lines and filamentary currents\n\nA field line obeys\n  dx/Bₓ = dy/Bᵧ.\nThat is,\n  dx/(B₀x/a) = dy/(–B₀y/a)  ⟹  dx/x = –dy/y.\nSeparating variables, d(ln|x|) = – d(ln|y|), and upon integration\n  ln|x| + ln|y| = constant  ⟹  xy = constant.\nThus the field lines are the hyperbolas (or their pieces) given by xy = constant. (In particular, the “null” line through the origin is xy = 0, i.e. the x– and y–axes.)\n\nA quadrupolar field such as this is commonly produced by a suitable arrangement of “filamentary” currents. For example one may approximate B by placing four long, thin wires (or current elements) along the z–direction at the positions (x,y) = (±R,0) and (0,±R) with currents chosen so that the resulting field in the vicinity of the origin sums to B ∝ (x, –y). (Any arrangement of two pairs of oppositely directed currents that produces a “quadrupole moment” is acceptable.) In a sketch one shows the hyperbolic field lines in the x–y plane and marks the four current filaments (all along ẑ) with arrows indicating the direction of current (two in the +ẑ and two in the –ẑ directions).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (c): Magnetic flux per unit z–length\n\nWhen a magnetic field has no z–dependence one may speak of “flux per unit length” in the z–direction. A very convenient way to characterize the 2D magnetic configuration is to introduce a flux function ψ(x,y) defined so that\n  Bₓ = ∂ᵧψ,  Bᵧ = –∂ₓψ.\nFor our field, one may check that\n  ψ(x,y) = (B₀/(a)) x y\nsatisfies\n  ∂ᵧψ = (B₀/(a)) x = Bₓ  and  –∂ₓψ = –(B₀/(a)) y = Bᵧ.\nSince ψ is constant on field lines, its value is a “label” for a particular field line. In particular, the field line that passes closest to the origin (i.e. that has its minimum distance equal to R) will have its minimum (absolute) distance when |x| = |y|. Along this line, we have\n  ψ = (B₀/(a)) x².\nTaking x_min = R/√2 so that the distance from the origin is r = √(2) |x_min| = R we see that the corresponding constant is\n  ψ = (B₀/(a)) (R²/2) = B₀R²/(2a).\n(The flux “between” the ψ=0 field line (through the origin) and a given field line is just the difference in ψ.) Thus the magnetic flux (per unit z length) contained between the origin and the field line whose minimum distance from the origin is R is\n\n  Φ = B₀R²/(2a).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (d): The electric potential seen by a moving observer\n\nNow suppose an observer moves with a non‐relativistic velocity\n  v = v ẑ.\nIn his frame (to first order in v/c) an electric field appears according to\n  E′ = –v × B.\nSince\n  B = (B₀/(a)) (x  x̂ – y  ŷ)\nwe compute\n  v × B = v ẑ × (B₀/(a))(x x̂ – y ŷ)\n      = (B₀v/(a)) (ẑ × x x̂ – ẑ × y ŷ)\nRecall that ẑ × x̂ = ŷ and ẑ × ŷ = –x̂ so that\n  v × B = (B₀v/(a)) (x ŷ + y x̂).\nThen\n  E′ = –(B₀v/(a))(y x̂ + x ŷ).\nSince this induced electric field is (for our non–relativistic observer) conservative, we may define a potential φ by\n  E′ = –∇φ.\nThat is,\n  ∂ₓφ = (B₀v/(a)) y  and  ∂ᵧφ = (B₀v/(a)) x.\nA short calculation shows that a potential which satisfies these equations is\n  φ(x,y) = (B₀v/(a)) x y,\nwith φ(0,0) = 0.

(We assume that the time–variation is slow enough that we may ignore radiation.) One standard method is to choose a vector potential A which yields B by\n  B = ∇×A.\nA simple choice is to take\n  A = (0, 0, A_z(x,y,t)),\nwith A_z chosen so that\n  Bₓ = ∂ᵧA_z  and  Bᵧ = –∂ₓA_z.\nSince Bₓ = (B₀(t)x/a) and Bᵧ = –(B₀(t)y/a), one may take\n  A_z(x,y,t) = (B₀(t)/(a)) x y.\nIn a gauge in which the scalar potential vanishes, the induced electric field is given by\n  E = –∂A/∂t = –(∂A_z/∂t) ẑ.\nThus\n  E(x,y,t) = –(x y/(a)) (dB₀/dt) ẑ.\nA quick check shows that the curl of this E is exactly what is required by Faraday’s law:\n  (∇×E)_x = ∂ᵧE_z = –(x/a)(dB₀/dt),\n  (∇×E)_y = –∂ₓE_z = (y/a)(dB₀/dt),\nso that\n  ∇×E = –(dB₀/dt)/a (x x̂ – y ŷ) = –∂B/∂t.\nThus the induced electric field is\n\n  E(x,y,t) = –(x y/(a)) (dB₀/dt) ẑ.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\nWe may now summarize our answers as follows:\n\n(a) The field \n  B = (B₀/(a))(x x̂ – y ŷ)\nsatisfies\n  ∇·B = 0  and  ∇×B = 0.\n\n(b) The field lines are the curves\n  xy = constant,\ni.e. rectangular hyperbolas.

For a boost at speed v along the x–axis the standard formulas give (here we use SI units; you may check with c’s restored when needed):\n\n  E′y = γ (E – vB)           (1)\n  B′z = γ (B – vE/c²)          (2)\n\nThus:\n\n(1) To find a frame in which the electric field vanishes (E′ = 0) one requires\n  γ (E – vB) = 0  ⟹ v = E/B.\nBut since v must be less than c, this boost exists provided that\n  E/B < c  ⟹ E < cB.\n\n(2) Similarly, to find a frame in which the magnetic field vanishes (B′ = 0) one requires \n  γ (B – vE/c²) = 0  ⟹ v = c²B/E.\nAgain, one must have v < c so that\n  c²B/E < c  ⟹ E > cB.\nThus, a frame in which B′ = 0 exists provided that E exceeds cB.\n\nNote that the other electromagnetic invariant, E·B, is zero in our situation; the only condition is on the combination E² and c²B².\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Motion in the Lab Frame When a Frame with E′ = 0 Exists\n\nSuppose that E < cB so that we can boost with\n  v = E/B  (in the x–direction)\nto a frame where the electric field is zero. (Call this the prime frame.)\n\nSince the particle is at rest in the lab frame, after this boost its velocity is\n  v′ = –v  (in the x–direction).\nIn the prime frame the only field is a (reduced) magnetic field B′ (whose exact magnitude is not needed for the qualitative discussion). A charged particle in a pure magnetic field undergoes uniform circular motion (with cyclotron frequency ω = qB′/(γ′m)). Therefore, in the prime frame the particle gyrates in a circle.\n\nWhen we transform the (circular) motion back to the lab frame the effect is to “add back” the boost. The result is that the lab‐frame motion is the well–known E×B drift:\n• A steady drift with velocity v₍d₎ = E×B/B². With E = (0, E, 0) and B = (0, 0, B) one obtains\n  v₍d₎ = (E/B, 0, 0);\n• Superimposed on this uniform motion is a “cyclotron gyration” (a circle about the drift center).\nThus the overall trajectory in the lab frame is a cycloid – that is, a combination of uniform drift along x (with speed E/B) and a circular orbit about a point which itself moves with the drift.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Momentum Versus Time in the Frame with B′ = 0\n\nNow assume instead that E > cB so that one can boost with\n  v = c²B/E  (in the x–direction)\nto a frame in which the magnetic field vanishes. (Call this the “B = 0 frame”.) In that frame the only field is a uniform electric field. (Its y–component is given by E′y = γ (E – vB), but for our purpose we denote this simply by E′.) In a region with a constant electric field and no magnetic field the force is simply\n  F = qE′,\nacting in the y–direction.\n\nAlthough one must be cautious with “constant force” in relativistic dynamics, one may show that if one uses the rapidity η defined by v = c tanh η and the relation\n  p = m c sinh η,\nthen the equations of motion (with proper acceleration a₀ = qE′/m) imply that the rapidity increases linearly with proper time τ:\n  η(τ) = (qE′/(m c))τ.\nMoreover, the coordinate time t in the B = 0 frame is given by\n  t = (m c)/(qE′) sinh η.\nThus, one easily finds that\n  sinh η = (qE′t)/(m c)  ⟹  p(t) = m c sinh η = qE′t.\nIn other words, even though the velocity approaches c asymptotically, the relativistic momentum in the B = 0 frame increases linearly with the coordinate time t.\n\nNote that if preferred one may write the answer in the equivalent hyperbolic form:\n  p(t) = m c sinh( (qE′t)/(m c) ).\nSince sinh(arcsinh (qE′t/(m c))) = (qE′t)/(m c), these forms are equivalent.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nAn acceptable answer is as follows:\n\n(a) A Lorentz frame exists in which\n (1) E = 0 if one boosts with velocity v = E/B (along the x–axis), provided that v < c, i.e. E < cB.\n (2) B = 0 if one boosts with velocity v = c²B/E (along the x–axis), which requires E > cB.\n  (In our fields the invariant E·B = 0, so these conditions on E and B alone are necessary and sufficient.)\n\n(b) If a boost with v = E/B exists (i.e. E < cB), then in that frame the field is purely magnetic and the particle (which was at rest in the lab) has initial velocity –E/B (in the –x direction). In a pure magnetic field the charged particle performs circular (cyclotron) motion. When transforming back to the lab frame, one finds that the motion is a super‐position of a uniform drift with velocity v₍d₎ = E×B/B² = (E/B, 0, 0) and a cyclotron gyration about the drift center. That is, the trajectory is cycloidal.\n\n(c) In the frame in which B = 0 (existing when E > cB), the only force is due to a constant electric field E′ along y. With the particle’s initial momentum taken as zero, one may show that its relativistic momentum is given by\n  p(t) = m c sinh( (qE′t)/(m c) )  or equivalently  p(t) = qE′t.\nThus the momentum increases linearly with time in the B = 0 frame.\n\nWe now give the final boxed answers.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Latex Boxed Format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\text{A boost with } v \\text{ along } x \\text{ yields:}\\\\[1mm]\n&(1)~E'=0 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad \\gamma (E -

(We assume that the beam is “long” so that edge effects may be ignored.) In what follows we denote by ρ or ρ₀ a “charge density” (by which we mean the charge per unit volume); one can always write ρ = –e n so that n is the number density and the minus sign indicates the electron’s charge. (For the purpose of “force‐magnitudes” we shall work with absolute values and omit minus signs when the context is clear.) We now describe how one may derive the answers.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Electric field (and force) inside a uniformly charged cylinder\n\nInside a cylinder of radius a with uniform charge density ρ₀ the electric field may be found by Gauss’s law. Choose a coaxial cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius r (with r < a) and length L. Then the enclosed charge is\n\n  Q_enc = ρ₀ · (area)·L = ρ₀ πr²L.\n\nBy symmetry the electric field points radially and has the same magnitude E(r) on the Gaussian surface. Gauss’s law gives\n  ∮E·dA = E 2πr L = Q_enc/ε₀ = ρ₀ πr²L/ε₀.\nThus,\n  E(r) = (ρ₀ r)/(2ε₀).\n\nSince each electron of charge e sees the field produced by all the other electrons, it “feels” a repulsive force (directed radially outward) whose magnitude is\n\n  F(r) = e E(r) = (e ρ₀ r)/(2ε₀).\n\nThat is our answer for part (a).\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (b): What does a laboratory observer see when the beam is moving?\n\nNow imagine the same cylindrical distribution—but now with “lab‐frame” charge density ρ (which need not equal ρ₀ because of Lorentz contraction in the longitudinal direction) moving with velocity v. In the lab frame two fields are present:\n • An electric field, which for r < a remains (by the same Gauss law applied “instantly” in the lab) \n  E(r) = (ρ r)/(2ε₀).\n • A magnetic field produced by the current density J = ρ v. (Its magnitude, by using the Ampère law in the steady‐state, is that of a “long straight wire” with the same r–dependence.) Specifically, one finds for r < a an azimuthal magnetic field \n  B(r) = (μ₀ ρ v r)/2.\n\nNow an electron in the beam moves with velocity v (parallel to the axis) and therefore sees a Lorentz force that is the sum of the electric force and the magnetic force (using v × B): \n  F = –e [E + v × B].\nA little thought on the directions shows that the v × B term is radially opposed to E.

However, due to Lorentz contraction the “lab density” ρ is not the density in the beam frame. In fact, if ρ is the lab–density then the proper density (the density in the beam frame) is\n\n  ρ' = ρ/γ,  with γ = 1/√(1–v²/c²).\n\nThus, the electric field in the beam frame is\n\n  E'(r) = (ρ' r)/(2ε₀) = (ρ r)/(2ε₀γ).\nAnd so the force on an electron is\n\n  F'(r) = e E'(r) = (e ρ r)/(2ε₀γ).\n\nHow does this compare with the lab frame force? From part (b)\n  F_lab = (e ρ r)/(2ε₀)(1 – v²/c²) = (e ρ r)/(2ε₀γ²),\nsince (1 – v²/c²) = 1/γ². Thus, we have the relation\n\n  F'(r) = γ F_lab(r).\n\nIn words: Even though in the co–moving frame the electric field (and force) is larger than that seen in the lab, the (transverse) force measured in the lab is reduced by a factor γ. In the limit v → c (so that γ is very large) the lab observer sees the self–repulsion almost canceled (by nearly complete cancellation between the Coulomb repulsion and the attractive magnetic force) while the beam–frame force is larger by a factor of roughly γ. (One must keep in mind that forces perpendicular to the motion transform differently than forces parallel to the motion.)\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (d): What magnetic gradient is required to “focus” the beam?\n\nSuppose one wishes to confine the beam in (say) the x–direction. A quadrupole magnet (or another suitable focusing system) produces a transverse magnetic field whose magnitude grows linearly from the axis:\n  B(x) ≈ B′ x,\nwhere B′ = dB/dx is the gradient (in Tesla per meter). For a relativistic electron moving with velocity v, a magnetic field produces a force\n  F_ext = e v B′ x     (in SI units)\ndirected (with the sign depending on the particular arrangement) to oppose the self–repulsion.\n\nTo “just hold” the beam from expanding we require this focusing force to cancel the net “space–charge” force. Taking the expression from part (b) and writing it (for small displacement x replacing r) we require\n\n  e v B′x = (e ρ x)/(2 ε₀)(1 – v²/c²).\n\nThe factor x cancels and then we solve for the needed gradient:\n\n  B′ = (ρ/(2 ε₀ v))(1 – v²/c²).\n\nNow, if we replace the charge density by the number density via ρ = e n, then\n\n  B′ = (e n/(2 ε₀ v))(1 – v²/c²).\n\nNow we plug in the given numbers. We are given\n  n = 2 × 10¹⁰ cm⁻³.\nSince 1 cm⁻³ = 10⁶ m⁻³, \n  n = 2 × 10¹⁰ × 10⁶ = 2 × 10¹⁶ m⁻³.\nAlso, v = 0.99c = 0.99 × 3.0×10⁸ m/s ≈ 2.97×10⁸ m/s.\nFurthermore, note that\n  1 – v²/c² = 1 – (0.99)² ≈ 1 – 0.9801 = 0.0199.\nThe other constants are:\n  e = 1.602×10⁻¹⁹ C  and  ε₀ = 8.854×10⁻¹² F/m.\n\nThus, the numerical value is\n\n  B′ = (e n/(2 ε₀ v)) (1 – v²/c²)\n     = [ (1.602×10⁻¹⁹ C)(2×10¹⁶ m⁻³) / (2×8.854×10⁻¹² F/m×2.97×10⁸ m/s) ] × 0.0199.\n\nLet us compute the factors step–by–step.\n\n1. Compute the numerator:\n  e n = (1.602×10⁻¹⁹)(2×10¹⁶) = 3.204×10⁻³ C/m³.\n\n2. Compute the denominator (before the factor 1–v²/c²):\n  2 ε₀ v = 2×8.854×10⁻¹² F/m×2.97×10⁸ m/s.\nFirst, 8.854×10⁻¹² × 2.97×10⁸ ≈ 2.63×10⁻³,\n  Then multiplied by 2: 2×2.63×10⁻³ ≈ 5.26×10⁻³ (in SI units).\n\n3. Thus, the fraction is\n  (3.204×10⁻³)/(5.26×10⁻³) ≈ 0.609.\nMultiplying by (1 – v²/c²) = 0.0199 gives\n  B′ ≈ 0.609 × 0.0199 ≈ 0.0121 Tesla/m.\n\nThus the needed magnetic gradient is about 0.012 Tesla per meter.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The electric field inside the cylinder and the force on an electron at r < a are\n  E(r) = (ρ₀ r)/(2ε₀)    and   F(r) = e (ρ₀ r)/(2ε₀).\n\n(b) In the lab the net force (after cancellation between electric and magnetic forces) is\n  F_lab(r) = (e ρ r)/(2ε₀) (1 – v²/c²).\n\n(c) In the beam’s rest frame the pure electric force is\n  F′(r) = e (ρ r)/(2ε₀γ)\nwith γ = 1/√(1–v²/c²). Hence, F_lab = F′/γ, so that at high speeds (v → c) the lab sees a very much reduced net force (by roughly a factor 1/γ²) because the magnetic attraction nearly cancels the Coulomb repulsion.\n\n(d) To “just hold” the beam (i.e. to cancel the net space–charge force) one must have a transverse magnetic gradient\n  dB/dx = (e n/(2ε₀ v)) (1 – v²/c²).\nFor n = 2×10¹⁰ cm⁻³ and v = 0.99c this works out to approximately 0.012 T/m.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Boxed Form\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & F(r)=\\frac{e\\,\\rho_{0}\\,r}{2\\epsilon_{0}},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & F_{\\rm lab}(r)=\\frac{e\\,\\rho\\,r}{2\\epsilon_{0}}\\Bigl(1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & F' (r)=\\frac{e\\,\\rho\\,r}{2\\epsilon_{0}\\,\\gamma},\\quad \\text{so that}\\quad F_{\\rm lab}(r)=\\frac{F'(r)}{\\gamma},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad & \\frac{dB}{dx}=\\frac{e\\,n}{2\\epsilon_{0}\\,v}\\Bigl(1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}\\Bigr)\n\\approx 0.012\\, \\text{T/m}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & F(r)=\\frac{e\\,\\rho_{0}\\,r}{2\\epsilon_{0}},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & F_{\\rm lab}(r)=\\frac{e\\,\\rho\\,r}{2\\epsilon_{0}}\\Bigl(1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & F' (r)=\\frac{e\\,\\rho\\,r}{2\\epsilon_{0}\\,\\gamma},\\quad \\text{so that}\\quad F_{\\rm lab}(r)=\\frac{F'(r)}{\\gamma},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad & \\frac{dB}{dx}=\\frac{e\\,n}{2\\epsilon_{0}\\,v}\\Bigl(1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}\\Bigr)\n\\approx 0.012\\, \\text{T/m}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & F(r)=\\frac{e\\,\\rho_{0}\\,r}{2\\epsilon_{0}},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & F_{\\rm lab}(r)=\\frac{e\\,\\rho\\,r}{2\\epsilon_{0}}\\Bigl(1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & F' (r)=\\frac{e\\,\\rho\\,r}{2\\epsilon_{0}\\,\\gamma},\\quad \\text{so that}\\quad F_{\\rm lab}(r)=\\frac{F'(r)}{\\gamma},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad & \\frac{dB}{dx}=\\frac{e\\,n}{2\\epsilon_{0}\\,v}\\Bigl(1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}\\Bigr)\n\\approx 0.012\\, \\text{T/m}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{F} = -\\frac{e \\rho_0 r}{2 \\varepsilon_0} \\mathbf{e}_r"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & F(r)=\\frac{e\\,\\rho_{0}\\,r}{2\\epsilon_{0}},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & F_{\\rm lab}(r)=\\frac{e\\,\\rho\\,r}{2\\epsilon_{0}}\\Bigl(1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & F' (r)=\\frac{e\\,\\rho\\,r}{2\\epsilon_{0}\\,\\gamma},\\quad \\text{so that}\\quad F_{\\rm lab}(r)=\\frac{F'(r)}{\\gamma},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad & \\frac{dB}{dx}=\\frac{e\\,n}{2\\epsilon_{0}\\,v}\\Bigl(1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}\\Bigr)\n\\approx 0.012\\, \\text{T/m}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{F} = -\\frac{e \\rho r}{2 \\varepsilon_0 \\gamma^2} \\mathbf{e}_r"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & F(r)=\\frac{e\\,\\rho_{0}\\,r}{2\\epsilon_{0}},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & F_{\\rm lab}(r)=\\frac{e\\,\\rho\\,r}{2\\epsilon_{0}}\\Bigl(1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & F' (r)=\\frac{e\\,\\rho\\,r}{2\\epsilon_{0}\\,\\gamma},\\quad \\text{so that}\\quad F_{\\rm lab}(r)=\\frac{F'(r)}{\\gamma},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad & \\frac{dB}{dx}=\\frac{e\\,n}{2\\epsilon_{0}\\,v}\\Bigl(1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}\\Bigr)\n\\approx 0.012\\, \\text{T/m}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{F'} = -\\frac{e \\rho_0 r}{2 \\varepsilon_{0}} \\mathbf{e}_{r} = -\\frac{e \\rho r}{2 \\varepsilon_{0} \\gamma} \\mathbf{e}_{r}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & F(r)=\\frac{e\\,\\rho_{0}\\,r}{2\\epsilon_{0}},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & F_{\\rm lab}(r)=\\frac{e\\,\\rho\\,r}{2\\epsilon_{0}}\\Bigl(1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & F' (r)=\\frac{e\\,\\rho\\,r}{2\\epsilon_{0}\\,\\gamma},\\quad \\text{so that}\\quad F_{\\rm lab}(r)=\\frac{F'(r)}{\\gamma},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad & \\frac{dB}{dx}=\\frac{e\\,n}{2\\epsilon_{0}\\,v}\\Bigl(1-\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}\\Bigr)\n\\approx 0.012\\, \\text{T/m}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\left| \\frac{d\\mathbf{B_0}}{dr} \\right| = 1.21 \\text{ Gs/cm}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "electro/1_28", "solution": "We wish to find the current density from a negatively biased electrode (the “cathode”) at 0 V to an anode at V₀, separated by a distance d, where electrons are emitted from the cathode at rest and the only limitation is the space‐charge (i.e. collisions are neglected). This is the classical problem that leads to the Child–Langmuir law.\n\nStep 1. Energy Considerations\n\nAn electron starting at rest at the cathode (x = 0) will gain kinetic energy as it moves in the electric potential φ(x). By energy conservation we have\n\n  ½ m v² = e φ(x).\n\nThus, the speed of the electron at potential φ is\n\n  v(x) = √(2eφ(x) / m).\n\nStep 2. Current Density\n\nThe electrons form a steady current density j. At any point, the electron density n(x) is such that\n\n  j = e n(x) v(x).\n\nThus, we can write\n\n  n(x) = j / [e v(x)] = j / [e √(2eφ(x)/m)] = j / [e √(2eφ/m)].\n\nStep 3. Poisson’s Equation\n\nThe space charge due to the electrons produces an electric potential φ(x). Poisson’s equation in one dimension is\n\n  d²φ/dx² = –ρ/ε₀,\n\nwhere ρ is the charge density. Since electrons carry a charge –e, we have\n\n  ρ = –e n(x).\n\nThus,\n\n  d²φ/dx² = e n(x) / ε₀ = j / [ε₀ √(2eφ/m)].\n\nStep 4. Differential Equation for φ\n\nWe therefore obtain\n\n  d²φ/dx² = (j / ε₀) √(m/(2e)) 1/√(φ).\n\nNow, multiply both sides by dφ/dx:\n\n  (d²φ/dx²)(dφ/dx) = (j / ε₀) √(m/(2e)) (1/√φ) (dφ/dx).\n\nNotice that the left-hand side is the derivative of (dφ/dx)²/2:\n\n  d/dx [ (dφ/dx)²/2 ] = (j / ε₀) √(m/(2e)) (1/√φ) (dφ/dx).\n\nWe now regard φ as the variable. Writing the derivative with respect to φ on the left gives\n\n  d/dφ [(dφ/dx)²/2] = (j / ε₀) √(m/(2e)) (1/√φ).\n\nIntegrate from φ = 0 (at x = 0) to some general φ:\n\n  [(dφ/dx)²/2] φ = 0 + (j / ε₀) √(m/(2e)) ∫₀^φ dφ'/√(φ').\n\nBut\n\n  ∫₀^φ dφ'/√(φ') = 2√φ.\n\nThus,\n\n  (dφ/dx)²/2 = (j / ε₀) √(m/(2e)) (2√φ)/1.\n\nThat is,\n\n  (dφ/dx)² = 4 (j / ε₀) √(m/(2e)) √φ.\n\nStep 5. Integrate Across the Gap\n\nWe now integrate from the cathode (x = 0 where φ = 0) to the anode (x = d where φ = V₀). For a given φ, we have\n\n  dx = dφ / (dφ/dx).\n\nThus,\n\n  d = ∫₀ᵛ₀ (dφ)/(dφ/dx) = ∫₀ᵛ₀ dφ / [ 2 √{ (j / ε₀)√(m/(2e)) √φ } ].\n\nThis can be rearranged as\n\n  d = 1 / [2 √{ (j / ε₀) √(m/(2e)) }] ∫₀ᵛ₀ dφ / φ^(1/4).\n\nThe integral is\n\n  ∫₀ᵛ₀ dφ / φ^(1/4) = (4/3) V₀^(3/4).\n\nThus,\n\n  d = (1/(2)) (4/3) V₀^(3/4) / √{ (j / ε₀) √(m/(2e)) }.\n\nSolving for the square root term:\n\n  √{ (j / ε₀) √(m/(2e)) } = (2/3) V₀^(3/4)/d.\n\nNow, square both sides:\n\n  (j / ε₀) √(m/(2e)) = (4/9) V₀^(3/2)/d².\n\nSolve for j:\n\n  j = (4/9) ε₀ √(2e/m) V₀^(3/2)/d².\n\nStep 6.

In these coordinates the speed is\n\n  v² = ṙ² + (r θ̇)² + (r sinθ φ̇)².\n\nIn what follows we will answer parts (a), (b) and (c) step by step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Canonical Momentum p₍φ₎\n\nThe canonical momentum conjugate to a coordinate q (here φ) is defined by\n\n  p₍φ₎ = ∂L/∂(φ̇).\n\nNote that the Lagrangian may receive contributions from both the “kinetic” (free) part and from the interaction term with the vector potential. Let’s calculate each contribution.\n\n1. Kinetic (free particle) part:\n\nThe relativistic free-particle Lagrangian is\n\n  L₍free₎ = –mc²√(1 – v²/c²).\n\nSince v depends on the velocities ṙ, θ̇, and φ̇, one may verify (by taking the derivative with respect to φ̇) that the “mechanical” momentum conjugate to φ is (see, for example, the standard result in spherical coordinates)\n\n  p₍φ₎^(free) = mγ (r sinθ)² φ̇ = mγ r² sin²θ φ̇,\n\nwhere the Lorentz factor is γ = 1/√(1 – v²/c²).\n\n2. Electromagnetic (interaction) part:\n\nThe interaction term in the Lagrangian is\n\n  L₍EM₎ = (e/c) A · v.\n\nBecause A only has a φ‐component and v has the φ-component v₍φ₎ = r sinθ φ̇, we have\n\n  L₍EM₎ = (e/c) A₍φ₎ (r sinθ φ̇)\n       = (e/c) (μ sinθ/r²) (r sinθ φ̇)\n       = (e μ/(c)) (sin²θ/(r)) φ̇.\n\nThus the derivative with respect to φ̇ is\n\n  ∂L₍EM₎/∂(φ̇) = (e μ/(c)) (sin²θ/(r)).\n\n3. Total canonical momentum p₍φ₎:\n\nSumming both contributions gives\n\n  p₍φ₎ = mγ r² sin²θ φ̇ + (e μ/(c)) (sin²θ/(r)).\n\nThus, our answer for (a) is\n\n  p₍φ₎ = mγ r² sin²θ φ̇ + (e μ/(c)) (sin²θ/(r)).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Conservation of p₍φ₎\n\nIn Lagrangian mechanics a coordinate is “cyclic” (or ignorable) if the Lagrangian does not depend explicitly on that coordinate. Here in our Lagrangian the coordinate φ appears only through its time derivative φ̇ (and not explicitly in any function), and hence it is cyclic.\n\nBy Noether’s theorem the conjugate momentum associated with a cyclic coordinate is conserved. Therefore, since φ does not appear explicitly in L, it follows that\n\n  dp₍φ₎/dt = 0,\n\ni.e. p₍φ₎ is a constant of the motion.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): The Effect of a Gauge Transformation\n\nNow suppose we change the vector potential by a gauge transformation\n\n  A' = A + ∇χ,  \n  χ = χ(r, θ, φ),\n\nso that the new Lagrangian becomes\n\n  L' = –mc²√(1 – v²/c²) + (e/c) A' · v\n      = L + (e/c)(∇χ · v).\n\nBut note that\n\n  ∇χ · v = dχ/dt – ∂χ/∂t.\n\nIf we assume that the gauge function χ is time‐independent (or even if it is time dependent, the extra term dχ/dt just adds a total derivative to the Lagrangian), then it adds a total derivative term (or a term whose φ dependence is only through a total time derivative). The Euler–Lagrange equations (and hence the equations of motion) are invariant under the addition of a total time derivative. \n\nHowever, let us examine explicitly the new canonical momentum conjugate to φ. The new electromagnetic term is\n\n  L'₍EM₎ = (e/c)[A₍φ₎ + (∂χ/∂φ)/ (the appropriate metric factor?]\n      = (e/c) [A₍φ₎ + ∂χ/∂φ] (r sinθ φ̇)     (since only the φ-velocity couples to ∂χ/∂φ).\n\nThus, when we take the derivative with respect to φ̇, we find that the new canonical momentum is\n\n  p₍φ₎' = mγ r² sin²θ φ̇ + (e/c) [A₍φ₎ (r sinθ derivative) + (∂χ/∂φ)(r sinθ) factor].\n\nMore carefully, because the extra term in the Lagrangian is (e/c)(∇χ) · v and v has a φ component r sinθ φ̇, the derivative with respect to φ̇ picks up an extra piece:\n\n  ∂/∂φ̇ [(e/c)(∇χ)·v] = (e/c) (∂χ/∂φ).\n\nThus, the full new canonical momentum is\n\n  p₍φ₎' = mγ r² sin²θ φ̇ + (e μ/(c)) (sin²θ/(r)) + (e/c) (∂χ/∂φ).\n\nThat is, the gauge transformation modifies the canonical momentum by adding a piece (e/c)(∂χ/∂φ).\n\nAlthough the explicit expression for p₍φ₎ has changed, the fact that φ remains cyclic in the new Lagrangian is not spoiled by adding a total time derivative. In other words, even though the numerical value of p₍φ₎ in terms of the coordinates and their derivatives shifts by the extra term (e/c)(∂χ/∂φ), the new momentum p₍φ₎' is still a constant of the motion. (Remember that adding a total time derivative in the Lagrangian does not affect the equations of motion.) \n\nThus, our answer to part (c) is:\n  Under the gauge transformation A → A + ∇χ the canonical momentum becomes\n    p₍φ₎' = mγ r² sin²θ φ̇ + (e μ/(c)) (sin²θ/(r)) + (e/c)(∂χ/∂φ).\nMoreover, since χ appears in the Lagrangian only through a total derivative, φ remains a cyclic variable and p₍φ₎' remains conserved.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The canonical momentum conjugate to φ is\n\n  p₍φ₎ = mγ r² sin²θ φ̇ + (e μ/(c)) (sin²θ/(r)).\n\n(b) Since φ does not appear explicitly in the Lagrangian (i.e. it is a cyclic coordinate), p₍φ₎ is a constant of the motion (dp₍φ₎/dt = 0).\n\n(c) Under the gauge change A → A + ∇χ the canonical momentum becomes\n\n  p₍φ₎' = mγ r² sin²θ φ̇ + (e μ/(c)) (sin²θ/(r)) + (e/c)(∂χ/∂φ).\n\nSince the extra term comes only from a total time derivative added to the Lagrangian, φ remains cyclic and the modified p₍φ₎' is still conserved.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &p_{\\phi}=m\\gamma\\,r^2\\sin^2\\theta\\,\\dot{\\phi}+\\frac{e\\mu}{c}\\frac{\\sin^2\\theta}{r},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\frac{dp_{\\phi}}{dt}=0\\quad\\text{(since }\\phi\\text{ is cyclic)},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &p_{\\phi}'=m\\gamma\\,r^2\\sin^2\\theta\\,\\dot{\\phi}+\\frac{e\\mu}{c}\\frac{\\sin^2\\theta}{r}+\\frac{e}{c}\\frac{\\partial\\chi}{\\partial\\phi},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{and }p_{\\phi}'\\text{ remains a constant of the motion.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &p_{\\phi}=m\\gamma\\,r^2\\sin^2\\theta\\,\\dot{\\phi}+\\frac{e\\mu}{c}\\frac{\\sin^2\\theta}{r},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\frac{dp_{\\phi}}{dt}=0\\quad\\text{(since }\\phi\\text{ is cyclic)},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &p_{\\phi}'=m\\gamma\\,r^2\\sin^2\\theta\\,\\dot{\\phi}+\\frac{e\\mu}{c}\\frac{\\sin^2\\theta}{r}+\\frac{e}{c}\\frac{\\partial\\chi}{\\partial\\phi},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{and }p_{\\phi}'\\text{ remains a constant of the motion.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &p_{\\phi}=m\\gamma\\,r^2\\sin^2\\theta\\,\\dot{\\phi}+\\frac{e\\mu}{c}\\frac{\\sin^2\\theta}{r},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\frac{dp_{\\phi}}{dt}=0\\quad\\text{(since }\\phi\\text{ is cyclic)},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &p_{\\phi}'=m\\gamma\\,r^2\\sin^2\\theta\\,\\dot{\\phi}+\\frac{e\\mu}{c}\\frac{\\sin^2\\theta}{r}+\\frac{e}{c}\\frac{\\partial\\chi}{\\partial\\phi},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{and }p_{\\phi}'\\text{ remains a constant of the motion.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "p_{\\phi} = m \\gamma r^2 \\sin^2 \\theta \\, \\dot{\\phi} + \\frac{e}{c} \\frac{\\mu \\sin^2 \\theta}{r}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "electro/1_87", "solution": "We will show that if a “free” spherical conductor of radius a (isolated so that its free charge may be adjusted) is placed in the field of a point charge outside its surface, then the free charge Q on the sphere must be made sufficiently positive so that the induced surface‐charge density, which is not uniform, is everywhere positive. (Here, “free charge” means the total charge you “give” to the sphere.) In fact, one may prove that if an external charge +q is located at a distance r from the center (with r > a) then the “polarization” created on a grounded sphere (i.e. one forced to zero potential) is given by\n\n  (1) σ₍g₎(θ) = – (q/(4πa²)) · ((1 – k²)/[1 – 2k cosθ + k²]^(3/2)) ,\n\nwhere we have defined\n\n  k = a/r  (< 1).\n\nNotice that for +q the induced (ground‐response) density is negative at every point of the sphere and – in fact – its maximum (in absolute value) occurs at the point (θ = 0) on the sphere nearest the charge. (One may check that a short calculation shows that the maximum magnitude is reached at θ = 0.)\n\nNow, if the sphere is not grounded but is given a positive free charge Q, then by the uniqueness theorem the answer is obtained simply by adding the (uniform) extra charge density Q/(4πa²) to the “grounded” answer.

(Here θ is the usual polar angle measured from the line joining the center of the sphere to the external charge.) When the external charge is +q the “negative” term is worst where its magnitude is greatest. One may show that the most negative value of σ₍g₎(θ) (namely, the most negative number) is attained at θ = 0. (One may verify that for 0 ≤ k < 1 the function F(θ) = (1 – k²)/[1 – 2k cosθ + k²]^(3/2) is maximized at cosθ = 1.) At θ = 0 the denominator becomes\n\n  1 – 2k (1) + k² = (1 – k)²,\n  so that\n  F(0) = (1 – k²)/(1 – k)³ = (1 + k)/(1 – k)².\n\nThus the worst‐case (most negative) value of σ is at θ = 0.

In that case the same method shows that the “grounded” induced charge density becomes\n\n  σ₍g₎(θ) = – ((–q)/(4πa²)) · ((1 – k²)/[1 – 2k cosθ + k²]^(3/2))\n         = + (q/(4πa²)) · ((1 – k²)/[1 – 2k cosθ + k²]^(3/2)).\n \nThus, with no extra free charge added (i.e. with Q = 0) the entire surface would carry the positive density\n\n  σ(θ) = 0 + σ₍g₎(θ) > 0  (for all θ).\n \nIn other words, when the external charge is –q the polarization of the sphere alone produces a positive surface charge density everywhere.

In what follows we assume that the charge q is the only free charge present (apart from its image charge which “mimics” the effect of the sphere).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Using the Method of Images in Vacuum\n\nFor a point charge located at s (with s > a) outside a grounded conducting sphere, the method of images tells us that the effect of the sphere can be reproduced by placing an image charge q′ inside the sphere at a point s′ (along the radial direction) given by\n\n  q′ = –q (a/s),\n\n  s′ = (a²/s) n̂,  with n̂ = s/|s|.\n\nThat is, the image charge is located along the line joining the center of the sphere and the original charge, at a distance a²/s from the center.\n\nThen, for any field point r (with |r| > a), the potential is the sum of the contributions from the real charge q and the image charge q′.

{"id": "electro/1_42", "solution": "We wish to find the electrostatic potential everywhere in space produced by a long ( i.e. z‑independent) cylinder of radius a whose cross‐section is “split” along a diameter. One half of the surface is held at potential V₀ and the other at 0; there is no net charge on the system. (See Fig. 1.17(a) in many texts.) Because the system is invariant in the z‑direction the problem is two‐dimensional in the (x,y)–plane (or, equivalently, in polar coordinates (r, φ)) and the potential obeys Laplace’s equation.\n\nBelow we describe one acceptable solution approach, determine the approximate form far away and near the cylinder, and finally describe qualitatively the field lines. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Finding the potential everywhere (Part (a))\n────────────────────────────\nBecause the problem is independent of z we write Laplace’s equation in polar coordinates\n  (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂V/∂r) + (1/r²) ∂²V/∂φ² = 0.\nThe two‐dimensional general solution that is regular at r = 0 (inside) and that vanishes at infinity (outside) is normally given as a Fourier series in φ. We choose the polar coordinates so that on the cylinder’s surface (r = a) the potential is given by a step function:\n  V(a,φ) = f(φ) = { V₀, for “one half” of the circle; 0, for the other half }.\nA usual choice is to let\n  f(φ) = V₀ for |φ| < π/2   and  f(φ) = 0 for π/2 < |φ| < π.\nNote that f(φ) is an even function in φ, so we expand it as a cosine series:\n  f(φ) = A₀/2 + Σₙ₌₁∞ Aₙ cos(nφ),\nwith Fourier coefficients\n  Aₙ = (1/π)∫₋π^(π) f(φ) cos(nφ) dφ.\nBecause f is even the integration may be done only from 0 to π:\n  Aₙ = (2/π)∫₀^(π) f(φ) cos(nφ) dφ\nbut note that f(φ) = V₀ only from 0 to π/2 and vanishes for π/2 < φ ≤ π. Thus,\n  Aₙ = (2V₀/π)∫₀^(π/2) cos(nφ) dφ = (2V₀)/(π n) sin(nπ/2).\nIn particular, A₀ = (2V₀/π)(π/2) = V₀.\n\nNow the “general” solution may be written (here we write separately the “inside” and “outside” solutions):\n  For r ≤ a:\n    V(r,φ)= A₀/2 + Σₙ₌₁∞ Aₙ (r/a)ⁿ cos(nφ),\n  For r ≥ a:\n    V(r,φ)= A₀/2 + Σₙ₌₁∞ Aₙ (a/r)ⁿ cos(nφ).\n\nSince sin(nπ/2) is zero for even n, only odd terms appear. That is, if we write n = 2k + 1 (with k = 0, 1, 2, ⋯), then the solution may be written as\n\n  For r ≤ a:\n    V(r,φ)= V₀/2 + (2V₀/π) Σₖ₌₀∞ [1/(2k+1)] (r/a)^(2k+1) cos[(2k+1) φ],\n  For r ≥ a:\n    V(r,φ)= V₀/2 + (2V₀/π) Σₖ₌₀∞ [1/(2k+1)] (a/r)^(2k+1) cos[(2k+1) φ].\n\nThis series “solves” the potential everywhere: it automatically satisfies Laplace’s equation and meets the boundary conditions (with the understanding that at the discontinuities the series converges to the average of the two limits).\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Far from the cylinder (r ≫ a), Part (b)\n────────────────────────────\nFor r ≫ a the terms with higher powers of (a/r) quickly vanish. The dominant terms come from the constant part and the n = 1 (k = 0) term:\n  V(r,φ) ≈ V₀/2 + (2V₀/π)(a/r) cos φ.\nSince a constant potential does not contribute to the electric field, we have for the “dipole–like” part:\n  V_dip(r,φ)= (2V₀ a/π)(cos φ/r).\nThus the electric field for r≫a is given by\n  E = –∇V ≈ –∇V_dip.\nIn polar coordinates one easily shows that\n  E_r = – ∂V_dip/∂r = (2V₀a/π)(cos φ)/r²,\n  E_φ = – (1/r) ∂V_dip/∂φ = (2V₀a/π)(sin φ)/r².\nThus the far–field line pattern is that of a two–dimensional dipole (with the constant V₀/2 being irrelevant for the field).\n\nAlternatively, in vector form\n  E(r,φ) ≈ (2V₀a)/(πr²) [cos φ ̂r – sin φ ̂φ].\n(In Cartesian coordinates this represents a dipole field pointing in the x–direction.)\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Very near the center (r ≪ a), Part (c)\n────────────────────────────\nFor r≪a we use the “inside” solution. Only the lowest order term in (r/a) is important. Expanding\n  V(r,φ) = V₀/2 + (2V₀/π)(r/a) cos φ + higher–order terms,\nwe see that near r = 0 the potential is nearly linear (plus a constant). (The constant V₀/2 does not affect the electric field.) Thus\n  V(r,φ) ≈ constant + (2V₀/π)(r/a) cos φ.\nThen calculating the field,\n  E_r = –∂V/∂r ≈ – (2V₀/π)(1/a) cos φ,\n  E_φ = –(1/r) ∂V/∂φ ≈ (2V₀/π)(1/a) sin φ.\nIn Cartesian language one finds that the field at the center is uniform and given by\n  E ≈ – (2V₀)/(πa) ˆx.\n(Recall that in polar coordinates, cos φ ̂r – sin φ ̂φ is just the unit vector ˆx.) This is the expected result: the region near the center “sees” essentially a uniform field directed from the high–potential side (the half with V = V₀, which we take to be at x > 0) toward the low–potential side.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Sketching the field lines (Part (d))\n────────────────────────────\nAn acceptable sketch is as follows:\n\n1. Inside the cylinder (r < a) the equipotential lines are nearly straight and parallel. In particular, near the center they are almost linear so that the electric field is approximately uniform, directed from the high–potential half (roughly the right side, x > 0) toward the low–potential half (x < 0).\n\n2. On the cylinder’s surface (r = a) the potential is discontinuous: one half of the circle is at V = V₀ and the other at V = 0. (In the mathematical solution the Fourier series converges to the average at the discontinuity.)\n\n3. For r ≫ a the field lines are those of a two–dimensional dipole. They emerge from the region near x > 0 and curve around toward x < 0. (Since the constant part of the potential has no effect on the field, the far–field is dominated by the dipole term.)\n\nThus, one may draw the field lines so that inside the cylinder they are nearly straight (horizontal), while outside they bend and “arc” from the positive–x region to the negative–x region.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n────────────────────────────\n(a) The potential everywhere is given by\n\nFor r ≤ a:\n  V(r, φ) = V₀/2 + (2V₀/π) Σₖ₌₀∞ 1/(2k+1) (r/a)^(2k+1) cos[(2k+1) φ].\n\nFor r ≥ a:\n  V(r, φ) = V₀/2 + (2V₀/π) Σₖ₌₀∞ 1/(2k+1) (a/r)^(2k+1) cos[(2k+1) φ].\n\n(b) For r ≫ a the potential is dominated by the dipole term:\n  V(r, φ) ≈ V₀/2 + (2V₀ a/π)(cos φ/r)\nand so the electric field is\n  E(r, φ) ≈ (2V₀a)/(πr²)[cos φ ˆr – sin φ ˆφ].\n\n(c) For r ≪ a the lowest–order term gives\n  V(r, φ) ≈ V₀/2 + (2V₀/(πa)) r cos φ,\nso that\n  E ≈ – (2V₀)/(πa) ˆx  (i.e. a uniform field pointing in the –x direction).\n\n(d) The field lines are nearly parallel (uniform) near the center (inside the cylinder) with the lines pointing from the V = V₀ side (roughly x > 0) to the V = 0 side (x < 0). Outside the cylinder the field lines curve outward so that the overall far‐field pattern is that of a dipole oriented along the x–axis.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Latex Box\n────────────────────────────\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad V(r,\\phi) &= \n\\begin{cases}\n\\displaystyle \\frac{V_0}{2}+\\frac{2V_0}{\\pi}\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2k+1}\\Bigl(\\frac{r}{a}\\Bigr)^{2k+1}\\cos[(2k+1)\\phi],\\quad r\\le a, \\\\[1em]\n\\displaystyle \\frac{V_0}{2}+\\frac{2V_0}{\\pi}\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2k+1}\\Bigl(\\frac{a}{r}\\Bigr)^{2k+1}\\cos[(2k+1)\\phi],\\quad r\\ge a.\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1em]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad V(r,\\phi)&\\approx \\frac{V_0}{2}+\\frac{2V_0 a}{\\pi}\\,\\frac{\\cos\\phi}{r}\\quad (r\\gg a),\\\\[1em]\n\\quad \\mathbf{E}(r,\\phi)&\\approx \\frac{2V_0a}{\\pi r^2}\\Bigl[\\cos\\phi\\,\\hat{r}-\\sin\\phi\\,\\hat{\\phi}\\Bigr],\\\\[1em]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad V(r,\\phi)&\\approx \\frac{V_0}{2}+\\frac{2V_0}{\\pi a}\\,r\\cos\\phi\\quad (r\\ll a),\\\\[1em]\n\\quad \\mathbf{E}&\\approx -\\frac{2V_0}{\\pi a}\\,\\hat{x},\\\\[1em]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &\\text{The field lines are nearly straight and horizontal (uniform) inside the cylinder (pointing from }x>0\\text{ to }x<0\\text{) and smoothly connect to a dipolar field (curving from the high‐potential region at }x>0\\text{ to the low one at }x<0\\text{) for }r\\gg a. \n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad V(r,\\phi) &= \n\\begin{cases}\n\\displaystyle \\frac{V_0}{2}+\\frac{2V_0}{\\pi}\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2k+1}\\Bigl(\\frac{r}{a}\\Bigr)^{2k+1}\\cos[(2k+1)\\phi],\\quad r\\le a, \\\\[1em]\n\\displaystyle \\frac{V_0}{2}+\\frac{2V_0}{\\pi}\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2k+1}\\Bigl(\\frac{a}{r}\\Bigr)^{2k+1}\\cos[(2k+1)\\phi],\\quad r\\ge a.\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1em]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad V(r,\\phi)&\\approx \\frac{V_0}{2}+\\frac{2V_0 a}{\\pi}\\,\\frac{\\cos\\phi}{r}\\quad (r\\gg a),\\\\[1em]\n\\quad \\mathbf{E}(r,\\phi)&\\approx \\frac{2V_0a}{\\pi r^2}\\Bigl[\\cos\\phi\\,\\hat{r}-\\sin\\phi\\,\\hat{\\phi}\\Bigr],\\\\[1em]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad V(r,\\phi)&\\approx \\frac{V_0}{2}+\\frac{2V_0}{\\pi a}\\,r\\cos\\phi\\quad (r\\ll a),\\\\[1em]\n\\quad \\mathbf{E}&\\approx -\\frac{2V_0}{\\pi a}\\,\\hat{x},\\\\[1em]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &\\text{The field lines are nearly straight and horizontal (uniform) inside the cylinder (pointing from }x>0\\text{ to }x<0\\text{) and smoothly connect to a dipolar field (curving from the high‐potential region at }x>0\\text{ to the low one at }x<0\\text{) for }r\\gg a. \n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad V(r,\\phi) &= \n\\begin{cases}\n\\displaystyle \\frac{V_0}{2}+\\frac{2V_0}{\\pi}\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2k+1}\\Bigl(\\frac{r}{a}\\Bigr)^{2k+1}\\cos[(2k+1)\\phi],\\quad r\\le a, \\\\[1em]\n\\displaystyle \\frac{V_0}{2}+\\frac{2V_0}{\\pi}\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{2k+1}\\Bigl(\\frac{a}{r}\\Bigr)^{2k+1}\\cos[(2k+1)\\phi],\\quad r\\ge a.\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1em]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad V(r,\\phi)&\\approx \\frac{V_0}{2}+\\frac{2V_0 a}{\\pi}\\,\\frac{\\cos\\phi}{r}\\quad (r\\gg a),\\\\[1em]\n\\quad \\mathbf{E}(r,\\phi)&\\approx \\frac{2V_0a}{\\pi r^2}\\Bigl[\\cos\\phi\\,\\hat{r}-\\sin\\phi\\,\\hat{\\phi}\\Bigr],\\\\[1em]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad V(r,\\phi)&\\approx \\frac{V_0}{2}+\\frac{2V_0}{\\pi a}\\,r\\cos\\phi\\quad (r\\ll a),\\\\[1em]\n\\quad \\mathbf{E}&\\approx -\\frac{2V_0}{\\pi a}\\,\\hat{x},\\\\[1em]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &\\text{The field lines are nearly straight and horizontal (uniform) inside the cylinder (pointing from }x>0\\text{ to }x<0\\text{) and smoothly connect to a dipolar field (curving from the high‐potential region at }x>0\\text{ to the low one at }x<0\\text{) for }r\\gg a. \n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "V = \\frac{V_0}{\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\arctan \\frac{2ar \\sin \\theta}{|r^2 -

{"id": "electro/1_89", "solution": "We wish to study a permanent dipole (with moment P) located a distance r (with r ≫ a) from the center of a neutral, perfectly‐conducting sphere of radius a. In our situation the dipole is oriented “radially” – that is, its moment points along the line joining the center of the sphere to the dipole, directed away from the sphere. (Some authors denote the permanent dipole moment by p; here we use P.) One may show (using, e.g., the method of images or a multipole expansion) that for r ≫ a the sphere “responds” essentially by developing an induced (dipole) moment of order a³ so that the interaction energy is very small. (In what follows we work in a system of units in which the factors 1/4πε₀ are set equal to unity. One may reinstate these constants as needed.)\n\nWe now explain step‐by‐step both parts.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 1. (Boundary conditions on the E‐field at the surface.)\n\nA perfectly conducting body requires that\n (1) the potential throughout the conductor must be constant; and \n (2) the electric field inside is zero.\n\nThus on the surface (which is the interface between vacuum and conductor) one must have:\n • The tangential component of the electric field vanishes. (This follows from the fact that if it did not vanish, then there would be a nonzero potential difference along the surface and currents would flow until equilibrium is reached.)\n • The perpendicular (normal) component of the electric field is not zero in general; in fact, if σ is the induced surface charge density then\n  E_normal (just outside) = σ / ε₀.\nAlso, inside the conductor the field is zero. (When we say “on the surface” we mean that the potential is continuous and equal to a constant.)\n\nThus, our answer for (a) is: On the surface we have \n V = constant (so that ∇ₜV = 0 and Eₜ = 0),\n and the electric field just outside satisfies\n  E_out · n = σ/ε₀,\nwhile inside, E = 0.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 2. (Force on the dipole)\n\nBecause the sphere is uncharged, its only response to the dipole’s field is to rearrange its free charges so as to keep its potential constant. For a small sphere (r ≫ a) it can be shown that the induced charge distribution is equivalent, to lowest order, to producing an induced dipole moment\n  P_induced = a³ E_loc,\nwhere E_loc is the “external” field (here due to the dipole) at the center of the sphere.\n\nNow, recall that the field on the axis of a dipole (pointing along the line joining the dipole to the field point) is given by\n  E_dipole = (2P)/r³. \nThus, to lowest order one obtains\n  P_induced ≃ a³ (2P/r³) = (2a³P)/r³.\nA standard result of linear dielectrics (or induced moments) is that the “interaction energy” of a permanent dipole P in an external field E_ext is\n  U_int = –P · E_ext.\nHowever, if the dipole is itself responsible for the polarization of an object (here our sphere) the “correct” interaction energy is only one‐half as large. (This “1/2” appears in many problems involving induced charges.)\nIn other words, one may show that the interaction energy (or “self‐energy” of the dipole in the presence of the conductor) is\n  U ≃ –½ P · E₍ind₎.\nSince here both dipoles (the permanent one and the induced one) lie along the same line, one may also obtain U by “regrouping” the dipole–dipole interaction. In fact, one may show that\n\n  U ≃ –½ a³ E²,\nwhere E is the external field at the sphere (namely, E ≃ 2P/r³ along the axis).

In what follows we assume the particle is non–relativistic so that only the lowest–order (“dipole”) radiation need be kept. (Any answer equivalent to the answers below is correct.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. The general result\n\nFor a non–relativistic point charge e with instantaneous acceleration a(t) the electric “radiation” field at large distances (in the radiation zone) is proportional to\n\n  E_rad ∝ n′×(n′×a)\n       (1)\n\nwhere n′ is the unit vector from the charge to the observer. (Throughout we set n′ as the “observer direction”.) Then the instantaneous power radiated per unit solid angle is given by\n   \n  dP/dΩ = (e²/(4πc³)) |n′×(n′×a)|².\n       (2)\n\nIt is sometimes preferable to write the acceleration in “dimensionless” form. Defining β = v/c so that a = d(βc)/dt = c dβ/dt we may also write\n   \n  dP/dΩ = (e²c/(4π)) |n′×(n′×dβ/dt)|².\n       (2a)\n\nThis is our answer (a).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. (a) General answer in terms of β and its time derivative\n\nThus, (a) one acceptable answer is\n\n  \n  dP/dΩ = (e²c/(4π)) | n′×( n′× (dβ/dt)) |².\n       (Answer a)\n  \nor, equivalently, writing a = c dβ/dt,\n  \n  dP/dΩ = (e²/(4π c³)) | n′×(n′×a) |².\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. (b) Oscillation along z\n\nSuppose the particle oscillates along the z–axis:\n  \n  z(t) = a cos(ω₀t). \n  \nThen the velocity and acceleration are:\n  \n  v_z(t) = –a ω₀ sin(ω₀t), a_z(t) = –a ω₀² cos(ω₀t).\n  \nThus the acceleration vector is\n  \n  a(t) = (0, 0, –a ω₀² cos(ω₀t)).\n  \nTake the observer direction n′ = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). We now compute (using the vector identity n′×(n′×a)=a–n′(n′⋅a)):\n  \n  n′⋅a = –a ω₀² cos(ω₀t) cosθ,\n  \nso that\n  \n  n′×(n′×a) = a – n′ (n′⋅a)\n          = (0,0,–a ω₀² cos(ω₀t)) + a ω₀² cos(ω₀t) cosθ n′.\n  \nIts magnitude is\n  \n  |n′×(n′×a)| = a ω₀² |cos(ω₀t)| √(1 – cos²θ)\n         = a ω₀² |cos(ω₀t)| sinθ.\n  \nSquaring and plugging into Eq. (2),\n  \n  |n′×(n′×a)|² = a² ω₀⁴ cos²(ω₀t) sin²θ.\n  \nThe time–averaged value over one period of cos²(ω₀t) is 1/2. Hence the time–averaged differential power is\n  \n  ⟨dP/dΩ⟩ = (e²/(4π c³)) (a² ω₀⁴ sin²θ)/(2)\n        = (e² a² ω₀⁴ sin²θ)/(8π c³).\n       (Answer b)\n\nIt is sometimes convenient to note that if we define a “dimensionless acceleration” by writing dβ/dt = a ω₀² cos(ω₀t)/c then the same answer follows.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. (c) Circular motion in the xy–plane\n\nNow suppose the particle moves in a circle of radius R in the xy–plane with constant angular frequency ω₀. Then the particle’s position is, e.g.,\n  \n  x(t)=R cos(ω₀t), y(t)=R sin(ω₀t), z(t)=0.\n  \nIts acceleration is centripetal:\n  \n  a(t) = –ω₀²R (cos(ω₀t), sin(ω₀t), 0).\n  \nAgain, take the observer direction n′ = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). The instantaneous value of n′⋅a is\n  \n  n′⋅a = –ω₀² R [ sinθ cosφ cos(ω₀t) + sinθ sinφ sin(ω₀t) ]\n      = –ω₀² R sinθ cos(ω₀t – φ).\n  \nThus\n  \n  (n′⋅a)² = ω₀⁴ R² sin²θ cos²(ω₀t – φ).\n  \nSince |a|² = ω₀⁴ R², we have, using \n  \n  |n′×(n′×a)|² = |a|² – (n′⋅a)²\n      = ω₀⁴ R² [1 – sin²θ cos²(ω₀t – φ)].\n  \nUpon time averaging the “rotating” quantity cos²(ω₀t – φ) over a full cycle we get 1/2 (note: the angular phase φ is constant for a given observer, but the time–average over t eliminates the t–dependence). Hence,\n  \n  ⟨|n′×(n′×a)|²⟩ = ω₀⁴ R² [1 – sin²θ/2].\n  \nThus the time–averaged differential power is \n  \n  ⟨dP/dΩ⟩ = (e²/(4π c³)) ω₀⁴ R² (1 – sin²θ/2).\n        = (e² ω₀⁴ R²/(4π c³)) (1 – ½ sin²θ).\n       (Answer c)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 5. (d) Sketching the angular distributions\n\n• For the linear oscillation along z (part (b)): The instantaneous radiation pattern is that of an oscillating electric dipole. After time–averaging, the angular distribution goes as sin²θ (with θ measured from the z–axis). Thus the radiation is zero along the z–axis (θ = 0, π) and maximum in the “equatorial” plane (θ = π/2).\n\n• For the circular motion in the xy–plane (part (c)): The time–averaged pattern is proportional to 1 – (1/2) sin²θ. Thus the radiation is maximum along the z–axis (θ = 0, π) and smaller in the plane (θ = π/2; in fact, one finds ⟨dP/dΩ⟩(π/2) is half the value at θ = 0).\n\nA schematic sketch would show a “doughnut” (or dipole) pattern for (b) and an “oblate” pattern, peaked along the z direction, for (c).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 6. (e) Qualitative changes in the relativistic case\n\nWhen the particle’s speed becomes relativistic, the radiation is no longer emitted in a symmetric dipole pattern. Instead, due to Lorentz–boosting the radiation is highly “beamed” in the direction of the instantaneous velocity. (In fact, the radiation is confined to a narrow cone about the particle's instantaneous velocity with an opening angle ~1/γ where γ = (1–v²/c²)^(–1/2).) Also, additional effects occur (such as “aberration” and frequency shifts) and the overall radiated power increases according to the full Liénard formula. In short, the angular distribution is much more anisotropic in the relativistic case.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) For an arbitrary non–relativistic motion,\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{e^2 c}{4 \\pi} \\Bigl|\\mathbf{n}'\\times\\Bigl(\\mathbf{n}'\\times\\frac{d\\beta}{dt}\\Bigr)\\Bigr|^2\n  \\]\n    or equivalently,\n  \\[\n  \\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{e^2}{4 \\pi c^3} \\Bigl|\\mathbf{n}'\\times\\Bigl(\\mathbf{n}'\\times\\mathbf{a}\\Bigr)\\Bigr|^2.\n  \\]\n\n(b) For oscillatory motion along z given by z(t)=a cos(ω₀t),\n  \n  \\[\n  \\Bigl\\langle\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}\\Bigr\\rangle = \\frac{e^2 a^2 \\omega_0^4}{8 \\pi c^3}\\sin^2\\theta.\n  \\]\n\n(c) For circular motion of radius R in the xy–plane with angular frequency ω₀,\n  \n  \\[\n  \\Bigl\\langle\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega}\\Bigr\\rangle = \\frac{e^2 \\omega_0^4 R^2}{4 \\pi c^3}\\Bigl(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\sin^2\\theta\\Bigr).\n  \\]\n\n(d) The sketches of the angular distributions are as follows:\n  • For (b) the radiation has a dipole pattern (∝ sin²θ), so it vanishes along the oscillation axis (θ = 0, π) and peaks in the equatorial plane (θ = π/2).\n  • For (c) the radiation is maximum along the z–axis (θ = 0, π) and reduced in the plane (θ = π/2).\n\n(e) In the relativistic case the radiation becomes strongly beamed in the direction of motion (with typical opening angle ~1/γ). Consequently, the angular distribution is highly anisotropic, and not given simply by the dipole patterns above. (Also, the total radiated power is increased.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad

{"id": "electro/5_19", "solution": "We will show that if you “do the math” in the two cases – (a) when the two positrons are separated along the beam (i.e. the velocity) direction and (b) when they are separated transverse to the beam – you obtain answers that can be written in “Coulomb‐law form” in the rest frame with extra factors of γ (the usual Lorentz–factor) appearing when one transforms to the laboratory frame. (Any answer reconciling these effects is acceptable.) Below is one acceptable solution.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 1. Write the answers in the beam (rest) frame\n\nLet the charges be q = e (positron charge), and assume that in their rest frame the distance between the two is d. (We choose coordinates so that the beam is along the x–axis.)\n\n(a) Longitudinal separation (one positron directly ahead of the other):\n\n• In the rest frame the field of e₂ on e₁ is purely Coulomb:\n  E′ = (e/(4πε₀)) (1/d²) 𝑥̂                    [1]\n  B′ = 0.\n• The Lorentz force then is\n  F′ = e E′ = e²/(4πε₀ d²) 𝑥̂.\n• And the acceleration (using Newton’s law in this frame) is\n  a′ = F′/m = e²/(4πε₀ m d²) 𝑥̂.\n\n(b) Transverse (side‐by–side) separation:\n\nNow assume the charges are separated by d in the y–direction.\n\n• In the rest frame the electric field is\n  E′ = (e/(4πε₀)) (1/d²) 𝑦̂                    [2]\n  B′ = 0.\n• Thus the force is\n  F′ = e E′ = e²/(4πε₀ d²) 𝑦̂,\n• And the acceleration is\n  a′ = e²/(4πε₀ m d²) 𝑦̂.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 2. Transform to the Laboratory Frame\n\nNow the beam’s laboratory frame is one in which both charges are moving with speed v (with γ = 1/√(1–β²), β = v/c) along the x–axis. In transforming we must remember two things: (i) the fields of a moving charge are not isotropic and (ii) distances parallel to the boost contract.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nCase (a): Longitudinal (along the beam)\n\n1. The separation along x contracts. That is, if the “rest–frame” separation is d then the lab sees\n  d_lab = d/γ.\n2. On the other hand, the well–known field of a charge moving with constant velocity (the “Lienard–Wiechert field”) gives, for an observation along the direction of motion,\n  E₍∥₎ = (e/(4πε₀)) (1–β²)/(r²) = (e/(4πε₀)) (1/γ²)/(r²).\n Since for the longitudinal case the lab distance is r = d/γ, we have\n  E_lab = (e/(4πε₀)) (1/γ²)/((d/γ)²) = e/(4πε₀ d²).\n Thus in the lab frame the electric field “comes out” with the same numerical value as in the rest frame:\n  E_lab = (e/(4πε₀ d²)) 𝑥̂.\n3. Also, when the observation point lies along the velocity the magnetic field vanishes (v and E are parallel). Hence,\n  B_lab = 0.\n4. The Lorentz force is then\n  F_lab = e E_lab = e²/(4πε₀ d²) 𝑥̂.\n5. However, note that the transformation of the “equation of motion” is different because the effective mass for acceleration along the direction of motion increases by a factor γ³. (This is a standard result: if F∥ = dp/dt then one finds a∥ = F∥/(γ³ m).) Therefore the acceleration observed in the lab is\n  a_lab = F_lab/(γ³ m) = e²/(4πε₀ γ³ m d²) 𝑥̂.\n  Intuition: Although the electric field “recovers” its rest–frame magnitude (because the contraction of d cancels the 1/γ² from the moving–charge field), the particle’s inertia in a longitudinal force is enhanced by γ³ so that the acceleration is much smaller.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nCase (b): Transverse (side–by–side)\n\n1. For the transverse separation the distance d is not contracted (only lengths parallel to v contract). So,\n  d_lab = d.\n2. The moving charge produces an electric field which is enhanced transverse to the velocity by a factor γ:\n  E_lab = (e/(4πε₀)) (γ/d²) 𝑦̂.\n3. It also produces a magnetic field given by\n  B_lab = (1/c²) (v×E_lab),\n so with v = v 𝑥̂ and E_lab = (eγ/(4πε₀ d²)) 𝑦̂ the cross product gives\n  B_lab = (e v γ/(4πε₀ c² d²)) 𝑧̂.\n4. The total Lorentz force on a charge moving with velocity v is\n  F_lab = e [E_lab + v×B_lab].\n Let us compute the second term:\n  v×B_lab = v 𝑥̂ × (e v γ/(4πε₀ c² d²) 𝑧̂)\n      = e v² γ/(4πε₀ c² d²) (𝑥̂×𝑧̂)\n      = – e v² γ/(4πε₀ c² d²) 𝑦̂    (since 𝑥̂×𝑧̂ = –𝑦̂).\n5. Hence,\n  F_lab = e [ (eγ/(4πε₀ d²)) 𝑦̂ – (e v² γ/(4πε₀ c² d²)) 𝑦̂ ]\n     = e²γ/(4πε₀ d²)[1 – v²/c²] 𝑦̂ = e²γ/(4πε₀ d²)(1/γ²) 𝑦̂,\n     = e²/(4πε₀ γ d²) 𝑦̂.\n6. For forces transverse to the velocity the effective inertial mass is increased by a factor γ (so that a = F/(γ m)). Thus,\n  a_lab = F_lab/(γ m) = e²/(4πε₀ γ² m d²) 𝑦̂.\n  Intuition: Here the transverse electric field is boosted by γ, but a nearly canceling magnetic effect (∝ v²/c²) reduces the net force by 1/γ relative to the rest force. In addition, the transverse “mass” is enhanced by γ, so that the acceleration is reduced by a factor 1/γ².\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) Two positrons separated longitudinally (one ahead of the other):\n\n1. In the beam (rest) frame:\n  \n  E′ = (e/(4πε₀)) (𝑥̂/d²),\n  B′ = 0,\n  F′ = eE′ = e²/(4πε₀ d²) 𝑥̂,\n  a′ = F′/m = e²/(4πε₀ m d²) 𝑥̂.\n\n2. In the laboratory frame:\n  \n  The separation is d_lab = d/γ. The moving–charge field for an observation in the longitudinal direction gives\n   E_lab = (e/(4πε₀)) (𝑥̂/d²),\n   B_lab = 0.\n  Thus,\n   F_lab = eE_lab = e²/(4πε₀ d²) 𝑥̂,\n   a_lab = F_lab/(γ³ m) = e²/(4πε₀ γ³ m d²) 𝑥̂.\n\nAn intuitive explanation is that although length contraction makes d_lab smaller (which would tend to enhance the Coulomb field), the fact that the “longitudinal” field of a moving charge is reduced by 1/γ² exactly cancels that, leaving the force unchanged; however, the inertia for acceleration along the beam is increased by γ³, so the acceleration is smaller by 1/γ³.\n\n(b) Two positrons separated transversely (side‐by–side):\n\n1. In the beam (rest) frame:\n  \n  E′ = (e/(4πε₀)) (𝑦̂/d²),\n  B′ = 0,\n  F′ = eE′ = e²/(4πε₀ d²) 𝑦̂,\n  a′ = F′/m = e²/(4πε₀ m d²) 𝑦̂.\n\n2. In the laboratory frame:\n  \n  Since there is no contraction transverse to v, d_lab = d. The moving–charge fields give:\n   E_lab = (e/(4πε₀)) (γ 𝑦̂/d²),\n   B_lab = (eγ v/(4πε₀ c² d²)) 𝑧̂.\n  Then the Lorentz force on a charge moving with v is\n   F_lab = e[E_lab + v×B_lab] = e²/(4πε₀ γ d²) 𝑦̂,\n  and the transverse acceleration (recall the “transverse mass” is γm) is\n   a_lab = F_lab/(γ m) = e²/(4πε₀ γ² m d²) 𝑦̂.\n  Intuitively, although the transverse electric field is enhanced by γ, a “magnetic” force of nearly equal magnitude (but opposite in sign) partially cancels the force so that the net force is down by 1/γ relative to the rest–frame force; furthermore the increased transverse inertia (by γ) leads to an acceleration that is smaller by 1/γ².\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer in LaTeX Boxed

{"id": "electro/1_16", "solution": "We wish to find the electric field in three regions and to “set up” (i.e. write as integrals) an expression for the potential of the inner sphere. In the problem we have two conductors: \n\n• A solid conducting sphere of radius r₁ carrying a charge +Q.  \n• A surrounding “hollow” (i.e. shell) conductor with inner radius r₂ and outer radius r₃.  \n\nBecause conductors are equipotentials and because of Gauss’s law the induced charges on the surfaces of the outer shell will arrange themselves so that the field in the conductors is zero. (In particular, if the outer sphere is not given any extra charge – it is neutral in total – then it will acquire an induced charge –Q on its inner surface (at r = r₂) and +Q on its outer surface (at r = r₃).)\n\nBelow we use Gauss’s law to obtain the fields in the various regions.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Find the Electric Field Using Gauss’s Law\n\nRecall Gauss’s law in integral form:\n  ∮ E · dA = Q_enc/ε₀.\n\nWe must consider three spatial regions.\n\n(a) Field outside the outer sphere (r > r₃):\n\nFor a Gaussian sphere of radius r > r₃ (which encloses everything) the enclosed charge is\n  Q_enc = Q (from the inner sphere) + (– Q on the inner surface of the shell) + (+ Q on the outer surface) = Q.\nThus, by symmetry,\n  E( r ) · 4πr² = Q/ε₀  ⟹  E(r) = Q/(4πε₀ r²)   (directed radially outward).\n\n────────────────────────────\n(b) Field “between” the spheres.\n\nNotice that there are two “between” regions to consider:\n (1) The cavity inside the outer conductor (i.e. r₁ < r < r₂) and \n (2) The material of the conductor itself (r₂ < r < r₃).\n\nInside any conductor at electrostatic equilibrium the electric field is zero. Thus, for r₂ < r < r₃ we have:\n  E = 0.\n\nNow, for the cavity region (which is that region between the inner sphere and the inner surface of the shell, r₁ < r < r₂) choose a Gaussian sphere of radius r with r₁ < r < r₂. This Gaussian surface encloses only the inner sphere’s charge (its entire charge + Q); the induced charge on the inner surface of the outer sphere resides exactly at r = r₂ and is not enclosed when r < r₂. Therefore,\n  ∮ E · dA = E(r) 4πr² = Q/ε₀  ⟹  E(r) = Q/(4πε₀ r²)   (radially outward).\n\nSo, the answers are:\n  For r₁ < r < r₂ (the cavity): E = Q/(4πε₀ r²) (radial).\n  For r₂ < r < r₃ (inside the conductor): E = 0.\n  For r > r₃: E = Q/(4πε₀ r²).\n\n────────────────────────────\n(c) Setting up an Expression for the Potential of the Inner Sphere\n\nWe wish to write the potential of the inner sphere, V(r₁), as the line integral of the electric field taken (say) from infinity to r₁, with the convention V(∞) = 0. Because of the different regions where the expression for E is different, our integration must take into account these regions.\n\nA convenient radial integration path goes:\n from r = ∞ to r = r₃ (outside the outer sphere), then \n from r = r₃ to r = r₂ (through the outer conductor), and finally \n from r = r₂ to r = r₁ (in the cavity between the spheres).\n\nThe potential difference is defined by\n  V(b) – V(a) = – ∫ₐᵇ E · dr.\nSince our path is radial and E is along the radial direction, the integrals become quite simple.\n\n(i) Region 1: From r = ∞ to r = r₃.\n For r > r₃, we have E(r) = Q/(4πε₀ r²). Thus,\n  V(r₃) – V(∞) = – ∫₍∞₎^(r₃) [Q/(4πε₀ r²)] dr\n Since V(∞)=0,\n  V(r₃) = Q/(4πε₀) [1/r₃].\n\n(ii) Region 2: Through the conductor from r = r₃ to r = r₂.\n In the conductor the field is zero so there is no potential drop:\n  V(r₂) = V(r₃).\n\n(iii) Region 3: From r = r₂ to r = r₁ (in the cavity).\n Here again, E(r) = Q/(4πε₀ r²). Thus,\n  V(r₁) – V(r₂) = – ∫₍r₂₎^(r₁) [Q/(4πε₀ r²)] dr\n        = Q/(4πε₀) [1/r₁ – 1/r₂].\n\nThus, the potential of the inner sphere is\n  V(r₁) = V(r₃) + (V(r₁) – V(r₂))\n      = (Q/(4πε₀) [1/r₃]) + (Q/(4πε₀)[1/r₁ – 1/r₂])\n      = Q/(4πε₀) [1/r₁ – 1/r₂ + 1/r₃].\n\nWe do not have to evaluate the integrals further since they have been written in integral form.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) Outside the outer sphere (r > r₃):\n  E(r) = Q/(4πε₀ r²)  (radially outward).\n\n(b) Between the spheres, there are two cases:\n  For the cavity, r₁ < r < r₂:\n   E(r) = Q/(4πε₀ r²)  (radially outward);\n  For the material of the outer conductor, r₂ < r < r₃:\n   E(r) = 0.\n\n(c) An expression for the potential of the inner sphere is given by\n\n  V(r₁) = ∫₍∞₎^(r₃) (Q/(4πε₀ r²)) dr + ∫₍r₃₎^(r₂) (0) dr + ∫₍r₂₎^(r₁) (Q/(4πε₀ r²)) dr,\nwhich simplifies to\n\n  V(r₁) = Q/(4πε₀) [1/r₃ + (1/r₁ – 1/r₂)].\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Latex\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &E(r) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,r^2}\\quad \\text{for } r > r_3,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\nE(r) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,r^2}, & r_1 < r < r_2,\\\\[1mm]\n0, & r_2 < r < r_3,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\nV(r_1) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\Bigl[\\frac{1}{r_3} + \\frac{1}{r_1} - \\frac{1}{r_2}\\Bigr].\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &E(r) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,r^2}\\quad \\text{for } r > r_3,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\nE(r) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,r^2}, & r_1 < r < r_2,\\\\[1mm]\n0, & r_2 < r < r_3,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\nV(r_1) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\Bigl[\\frac{1}{r_3} + \\frac{1}{r_1} - \\frac{1}{r_2}\\Bigr].\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &E(r) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,r^2}\\quad \\text{for } r > r_3,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\nE(r) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,r^2}, & r_1 < r < r_2,\\\\[1mm]\n0, & r_2 < r < r_3,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\nV(r_1) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\Bigl[\\frac{1}{r_3} + \\frac{1}{r_1} - \\frac{1}{r_2}\\Bigr].\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{E}(r) = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 r^2} \\mathbf{e}_r \\quad (r > r_3)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "electro/5_10", "solution": "We wish to study what happens to the fields and charge/current when we “boost” from a frame in which the wire is neutral to one in which the currents and charges are seen moving at different speeds. In the “lab‐frame” (frame A) the infinitely long, perfectly conducting wire (of circular cross‐section of radius r) carries a steady current i but is electrically neutral. (All observers agree that the rest frame of the positive “lattice” has zero proper charge density and the conduction electrons, though moving at high speed U, are arranged with just the right density so that overall the wire is neutral.) An observer B, moving along the wire with speed v (along the z–axis, say) will, however, see a different mixture of electric and magnetic fields and a nonzero net charge density. One acceptable answer is obtained by “boosting” the A–fields. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.)\n\nBelow we explain step‐by‐step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Fields in A–\n\nIn frame A the wire is neutral so that, in our chosen units,\n  E = 0,\nand by Ampère’s law the magnetic field is the familiar one outside a long straight wire:\n  B = (μ₀i)/(2πr) φ̂        (with φ̂ the azimuthal unit vector).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Lorentz transforming the fields\n\nThe standard formulas for a boost along the z–axis (with speed v) are (for fields perpendicular to the boost):\n\n  E'⊥ = γ (E⊥ + v × B),\n  B'⊥ = γ (B⊥ – (v/c²)× E).\n\nSince E = 0 in A we immediately have\n  E' = γ (v × B),\nand\n  B' = γ B\n(there is no “parallel” component in our situation).\n\nThe velocity v points in the +z–direction. At a point at distance r (with cylindrical coordinates (r, φ, z)) the magnetic field in A is  \n  B = (μ₀ i)/(2πr) φ̂.  \nNow, using the right–hand rule in cylindrical coordinates the cross product is\n  v × B = v ẑ × ( (μ₀ i)/(2πr) φ̂ ) = (μ₀ i v)/(2πr) (ẑ × φ̂).\nOne may show that ẑ × φ̂ = –r̂ so that \n  E' = –γ (μ₀ i v)/(2πr) r̂.       (1)\n\nLikewise,\n  B' = γ (μ₀ i)/(2πr) φ̂.         (2)\n\nThus, in the B–frame there appears an electric field directed radially (with a minus sign meaning “inward” if we define r̂ as the outward radial unit vector) along with a “boosted” magnetic field.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Finding the charge density implied by E′\n\nIn electrostatics a line charge density λ produces an electric field\n  E(r) = λ/(2πε₀ r)  r̂.\n\nComparing with (1) we identify\n  |E'| = γ (μ₀ i v)/(2πr) = |λ'|/(2πε₀ r).\n\nThus, equating the magnitudes,\n  λ' = γ μ₀ ε₀ i v = γ (i v)/c²,\nsince μ₀ε₀ = 1/c². (Notice that here the sign is dictated by the direction of the field; since our E′ in (1) is inward, we have a negative line density for i > 0.) Hence, writing explicitly,\n  λ' = –γ (i v)/c².\n\nIf one wishes, one may also speak of the volume charge density ρ′ by dividing by the cross–sectional area A of the wire:\n  ρ' = λ'/A = –γ (i v)/(c² A).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Velocities of the ions and electrons as seen by B\n\nIn frame A we have\n• Ions (the fixed “lattice”) are at rest.\n• Electrons move (say) with speed U (to produce a current i). (For a positive current i flowing in the +z direction, the electrons must be moving in the –z direction; here we choose U as a positive number so that in A the electron velocity is uₑ = –U ẑ.)\n\nNow, the velocity transformation along the z–axis is, for an object with velocity u in A,\n  u' = (u – v)/(1 – uv/c²).\n\nThus,\n(a) For the ions (u_i = 0) we obtain\n  u'_i = (0 – v)/(1 – 0) = –v    (i.e. the ions move in the –z direction with speed v as seen by B).\n\n(b) For the electrons (uₑ = –U) we have\n  u'_e = (–U – v)/(1 + (Uv)/c²)  ,\nso that in B the electrons are moving in the negative z–direction with speed\n  |u'_e| = (U + v)/(1 + (Uv)/c²).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 5. Interpretation\n\nIn A the wire is neutral (the positive ionic and negative electronic charge densities cancel exactly). But in B the two charge streams are moving with different speeds, and thus “experience” different Lorentz contractions. In particular the moving lattice (ions) is now moving with speed v (and is therefore Lorentz–contracted by the usual γ factor) whereas the electrons, having a different speed according to (4b), contract by a different factor. The difference in the two Lorentz factors produces a net charge density in B which is precisely that needed to give rise to the electric field (1) seen by B.

(Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)\n\nIn what follows we present one acceptable solution in SI units (with the final answers also given in Gauss for the magnetic field in part (a)). (One must be a bit careful since many texts on synchrotron radiation use Gaussian units; just be sure to use a self–consistent system.)\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. (a) Finding the Required Field\n\nAn electron of (relativistic) momentum\n  p = γ m v \nmoves in a magnetic field B where the Lorentz force provides the required centripetal force. In SI one has\n\n  e v B = p v/R        [since the magnetic force is perpendicular to v, and so gives the “centripetal force”]\n\nBut more directly the well–known “cyclotron radius” for a relativistic particle is\n\n  R = p/(eB).\n\nFor ultra–relativistic motion we have v ≃ c and the total energy is E ≃ γ mc². Since (in any relativistic treatment) p = γ m v and here v ≃ c we have\n\n  p ≃ E/c.\n\nThus the condition R = p/(eB) becomes\n\n  R = (E/c)/(eB)\n  ⇒ B = E/(e c R).\n\nThis is our analytical answer. (In SI units, E must be in Joules, e in Coulombs, c in m/s, and R in m. In SI the field comes out in Tesla; to convert to Gauss use 1 Tesla = 10⁴ Gauss.)\n\nNow let us compute the number. We are given:\n  R = 30 m,\n  E = 2.5×10⁹ eV.\n\nFirst, convert the energy to Joules. Since\n  1 eV = 1.602×10⁻¹⁹ J,\nwe have\n  E = 2.5×10⁹ eV ≃ 2.5×10⁹ × 1.602×10⁻¹⁹ J ≃ 4.005×10⁻¹⁰ J.\n\nNext, use the following constants:\n  e = 1.602×10⁻¹⁹ C,\n  c = 3.00×10⁸ m/s.\n\nThus,\n  B = E/(e c R)\n    = (4.005×10⁻¹⁰ J) / [ (1.602×10⁻¹⁹ C)(3.00×10⁸ m/s)(30 m) ].\n\nLet us compute the denominator:\n  e c R = 1.602×10⁻¹⁹ × 3.00×10⁸ × 30 \n       = 1.602×3.00×30 ×10^(–19+8) \n       = (1.602×90) ×10^(–11)\n       ≃ 144.18×10⁻¹¹ = 1.4418×10⁻⁹ (in SI units).\n\nThus,\n  B ≃ (4.005×10⁻¹⁰)/(1.4418×10⁻⁹) ≃ 0.2777 Tesla.\n\nIn Gauss, \n  B ≃ 0.2777 × 10⁴ Gauss ≃ 2777 Gauss.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. (b) Fractional Energy Loss per Revolution\n\nAlthough we have assumed that the electron does not lose energy (so that its orbit is circular), in fact an accelerated charge radiates. (For synchrotron radiation one must use the relativistic Larmor–formula.) In Gaussian units (which are often most convenient for radiation problems) the instantaneous power radiated from a charge moving with acceleration perpendicular to its velocity is\n\n  P = (2 e² γ⁴ a²)/(3 c³).\n\nFor circular motion the (magnitude of the) acceleration is\n\n  a = v²/R ≃ c²/R  (for v ≃ c).\n\nThus\n  P = (2 e² γ⁴ c⁴)/(3 c³ R²) = (2 e² γ⁴ c)/(3 R²).\n\nNow, the time to complete one revolution is approximately\n\n  T = 2πR/c.\n\nSo the energy loss per revolution is\n\n  ΔE = P T = [(2 e² γ⁴ c)/(3 R²)] (2πR/c) = (4π e² γ⁴)/(3 R).\n\nIt is best to express this answer in a “dimensionless” form by dividing by the total energy E. Recall that for an ultra–relativistic electron,\n\n  γ = E/(m c²).\n\nThus\n  ΔE/E = (4π e² γ⁴)/(3 R E) = [ (4π e²)/(3 R) ] [E⁴/(m⁴ c⁸)] (1/E)\n    = (4π e² E³)/(3 m⁴ c⁸ R).\n\nThis is the desired analytical expression.\n\nIt is common (and instructive) to rewrite the combination e²/(m c²) as the “classical electron radius” (in Gaussian units)\n\n  r_e = e²/(m c²).\n\nThen note that\n  (e²/(m⁴ c⁸)) E³ = (e²/(m c²)) (E/(m c²))³ = r_e (E/(mc²))³.\nThus an equivalent answer is\n\n  ΔE/E = (4π/3)(r_e/R) (E/(mc²))³.\n\nLet us now evaluate this numerically. (We shall use the well–known value in SI for the classical electron radius as\n  r_e ≃ 2.818×10⁻¹⁵ m,\nbut it is easier to use a standard synchrotron–radiation formula.)\n\nUsing:\n  E = 2.5×10⁹ eV,\n  mc² = 0.511×10⁶ eV    (so that γ = E/(mc²) ≃ 2.5×10⁹ / 0.511×10⁶ ≃ 4893),\n  R = 30 m,\n  r_e = 2.818×10⁻¹⁵ m,\nwe have\n\n  ΔE/E = (4π/3) (r_e/R) (γ)³\n    = (4π/3) (2.818×10⁻¹⁵/30) (4893³).\n\nNow, 4893³ ≃ (4.893×10³)³.

(a) Show that Aₓ = 0.\n\nRecall that the Lorenz gauge condition, in the absence of the scalar potential (ϕ = 0), reduces to\n\n  ∇·A = 0.\n\nNow, since A is a function of the variable (x – ct) only, the derivatives with respect to y and z vanish and we have\n\n  ∇·A = ∂Aₓ/∂x.\n\nThus the gauge condition becomes\n\n  ∂Aₓ/∂x = 0.\n\nThis tells us that Aₓ can depend only on time; however, because A itself is a function only of (x – ct) (and not an independent function of time), it can only be a constant. In other words, Aₓ must be independent of both x and time.

This means that the transverse components of the canonical momentum are cyclic variables and their corresponding momenta are conserved. Denote the transverse canonical momentum by p₍⊥₎ = (p_y, p_z). Thus,\n\n  d/dt (p_y) = 0 and d/dt (p_z) = 0.\n\nBy definition, the transverse canonical momenta are\n\n  p_y = mγ v_y + e A_y,\n  p_z = mγ v_z + e A_z.\n\nNow, since the particle is initially at rest it follows that\n\n  p_y(0) = 0 and A_y(0) = 0   (when the particle is far from the pulse)\n  p_z(0) = 0 and A_z(0) = 0.\n\nThus, by the conservation of the canonical momentum, we have\n\n  mγ v_y + e A_y = 0 ⟹ p_y = –e A_y,\n  mγ v_z + e A_z = 0 ⟹ p_z = –e A_z.\n\nIn vector notation for the transverse components we then have\n\n  p₍⊥₎ = –e A.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThus, we have shown that\n\n(a) Aₓ = 0,\n\nand\n\n(b) p₍⊥₎ = –e A.\n\nExpressed in the final boxed answer we have\n\n  \\[\\boxed{A_{x}=0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathbf{p}_{\\perp}=-e\\,\\mathbf{A}}\\]", "final_answers": ["A_{x}=0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathbf{p}_{\\perp}=-e\\,\\mathbf{A}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "A_{x}=0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathbf{p}_{\\perp}=-e\\,\\mathbf{A}", "expr2": "A_x = 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "A_{x}=0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathbf{p}_{\\perp}=-e\\,\\mathbf{A}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{p}_\\perp = -e \\mathbf{A}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Moreover, from the symmetry of the problem the potential (in spherical coordinates) will depend on r and the polar angle θ (measured from the z‐axis) only.\n\nStep 1. Write the general solution\n\nFor problems with axial symmetry the general solution of Laplace’s equation in spherical coordinates (with no φ-dependence) is\n  φ(r,θ) = Σ (Aₗ rˡ + Bₗ r^(–(l+1))) Pₗ(cosθ)\nFor our problem only the l = 1 term is needed.

{"id": "electro/1_64", "solution": "We start by noting that when a dielectric sphere (with dielectric constant ε) is placed in a uniform electric field E₀ (taken to be along the z‐axis), it becomes polarized. One may show (by solving Laplace’s equation with the appropriate boundary conditions at the surface of the sphere) that the polarization produces an induced surface charge given by\n\n  σ(θ) = [(ε – ε₀)/(ε + 2ε₀)]·3ε₀E₀ cos θ,  (1)\n\nwhere θ is the polar angle measured from the direction of E₀.\n\nLet us now consider what happens when the sphere is rotated at an angular velocity ω about the z‐axis (i.e. the direction of E₀). One might worry that by moving the charges on the surface one is creating a “current” and hence a magnetic field. (In many situations a rotating charged body yields a magnetic dipole moment!) However, the situation here is more subtle.\n\nStep 1. The surface charge distribution in (1) is static in the body of the sphere; it is “frozen in” by the polarization and is in one‐to‐one correspondence with the direction of the applied E₀. Because σ(θ) depends only on the polar angle θ and not on the azimuthal angle φ, the charge distribution is axially symmetric about the z‑axis.\n\nStep 2. When the sphere is rotated about the z‑axis, each point on the sphere (and hence the bound charge at that point) is moving. One might compute a surface current density\n\n  K(θ) = σ(θ) v = σ(θ) (ωR sin θ)  (2)\n\nwhich flows in the φ‑direction. (Here v is the speed of the surface charge at radius R and polar angle θ.) Although there is local motion of charges (and thus a current), the key point is that the overall pattern of σ(θ) remains fixed in the laboratory frame because the rotation is about the symmetry axis. The surface charge pattern, being proportional to cos θ, is independent of φ. Thus every “ring” of current at a fixed θ is exactly balanced by its counterpart 180° away in θ. In fact, if one computes the net magnetic dipole moment m from the surface currents by the formula\n\n  m = ½ ∮ (r × K) dA,\n  \none finds, after an integration over the sphere, that the contributions symmetrically cancel, yielding a zero net magnetic moment.\n\nStep 3. It turns out that although there are circulating bound currents, the symmetry of the problem guarantees that no net magnetic field is produced. (One way to see this is to note that the rotating sphere still has an electric dipole moment which does not change in time. It is, in this sense, “stationary,” and no steady magnetic field appears from a static dipole.) In other words, the distribution of currents is such that when one calculates the magnetic field (for example, the field far from the sphere), everything cancels out.\n\nThus, even though the surface charges are in motion, no net magnetic field is generated by rotating the sphere around the direction of E₀.\n\nFinal Answer: \n – The induced surface charge density is\n  σ(θ) = [(ε – ε₀)/(ε + 2ε₀)]·3ε₀E₀ cos θ.\n – When the sphere is rotated about the E₀ direction the moving charges produce an axially symmetric current pattern (with no azimuthal variation), so that all contributions to a net magnetic field cancel.

In classical electrostatics (with K = 0) the electric field inside a hollow conductor is zero – this is the well-known result of Gauss’s law and the shell theorem.\n\nThe Theoretical Basis:\n • In the standard case, a spherical shell of charge produces no electric field in its interior.\n • However, when the potential takes the Yukawa form, the field inside is no longer guaranteed to vanish since the “screening” coming from the term –K²φ breaks the exact cancellation. Mathematically, the solution of (∇² – K²)φ = 0 inside the shell is not just a constant but may involve spatial variations depending on the boundary conditions.\n • Thus, by measuring the electric field (or potential gradient) inside a precisely manufactured spherical shell charged to a known value, one can search for deviations from zero.\n\nThe Null Experiment:\n 1. Prepare a spherical conducting shell and charge it uniformly.\n 2. Using an extremely sensitive electrometer or potential probe, measure the electric field or potential gradient at various points inside the shell.\n 3. In the absence of a Yukawa modification (K = 0), the measured field should be exactly zero. Any nonzero residual measured field would indicate a deviation from standard Coulomb behavior, hinting at a nonvanishing K.\n\nThus, if one observes a slight but measurable field inside the shell, this would be evidence for the modified potential and imply that (∇² – K²)φ = –4πρ is the correct governing equation.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n The replacement for Poisson’s equation is\n  (∇² – K²)φ = –4πρ,\nand one suitable null experiment is to measure the electric field inside a uniformly charged spherical shell – any deviation from zero indicates a nonvanishing K.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(\\nabla^2 - K^2)\\phi = -4\\pi\\rho \\quad \\text{with a null experiment based on measuring deviations from zero field inside a charged spherical shell.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["(\\nabla^2 - K^2)\\phi = -4\\pi\\rho \\quad \\text{with a null experiment based on measuring deviations from zero field inside a charged spherical shell.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "(\\nabla^2 - K^2)\\phi = -4\\pi\\rho \\quad \\text{with a null experiment based on measuring deviations from zero field inside a charged spherical shell.}", "expr2": "\\nabla^2 \\phi + K^2 \\phi = -4 \\pi \\rho"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

One standard way to analyze the problem is to Lorentz transform to the rest frame of the moving surface, compute the reflection (which, for a good “mirror”, does not change the frequency in the mirror’s frame), and then transform back to the lab frame. Let us outline the necessary steps.\n\nStep 1. Transform the incident wave to the rest frame of the medium.\n\nIn the lab frame the wave four‐vector is\n  (k^μ) = (ω/c, 0, 0, k),\nwith k = ω/c (since z is the direction of propagation).

Transform the reflected wave back to the lab frame.\n\nWe now Lorentz transform back to the lab (stationary) frame. Under a Lorentz boost along the z‑axis, the frequency transforms as\n\n  ω_r = γ (ω′ + v k′_z).\n\nFor the reflected wave, k′_z = –ω′/c.

The Electric Field \n───────────────────────────── \nA permanent polarization produces bound charges. In any polarized dielectric one defines\n\n  ρ_b = –∇·P   and  σ_b = P·n⃗   (3)\n\nwhere n⃗ is the outward normal on the surface.\n\nSince (in cylindrical coordinates) the polarization is \n  P = a r 𝑟̂   (4)\n(with P only in the r‑direction) the divergence is\n  ∇·P = (1/r)∂(rP_r)/∂r = (1/r) d/dr (a r^2) = 2a,  (5)\nso that\n  ρ_b = –2a     (for r < R).  (6)\n\nAt the curved (side) surface (r = R) the outward unit normal is n⃗ = r̂ so that\n  σ_b = P(R)·r̂ = aR.   (7)\n\nBecause the cylinder is infinitely long there are no “end‐caps” and no other charges appear.\n\nNow, by symmetry the E–field must be radial and depend only on r. One may apply Gauss’s law for the electric field:\n  ∮E·dA = (1/ε₀)Q_enc.  (8)\n\n• For r < R choose a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius r and length L. The enclosed charge is\n  Q_enc = ρ_b (area) = (–2a)(π r² L),\nso that\n  E(r) (2π r L) = (–2a π r² L)/ε₀  ⟹  \n  E(r) = –(a r/ε₀).  (9)\nThus, inside the cylinder the electric field is\n  E = –(a/ε₀) r 𝑟̂   for r < R.\n\n• For r > R the Gaussian surface encloses both the entire volume charge (–2a over the circular cross–section of area πR²) and the surface charge along r = R (with total charge σ_b·(surface area) = aR · (2πR L) = 2πaR²L). Hence\n  Q_enc = (–2a πR² L) + (2πaR² L) = 0.\nThus,\n  E = 0   for r > R.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 2. The Magnetic Field \n───────────────────────────── \nWhen the cylinder rotates, every charged “bit” of the dielectric moves with the local velocity\n\n  v = ω × r⃗.  (10)\n\nSince the cylinder rotates about z, a point at position (r,φ) (with r < R) has velocity\n  v = ω r 𝜙̂.  (11)\n\nThus both the volume and surface bound charges are moving. (They remain “bound” to the material, but in motion they create currents.) In our non‐relativistic treatment we assume the moving charge “simply” produces a current density given by\n\n  J = ρ_b v,   in the bulk (r < R),\n  K = σ_b v,   on the surface (r = R).  (12)\n\nSo we obtain:\n\n• For r < R (volume current)\n  J(r) = (–2a) [ωr 𝜙̂] = –2a ω r 𝜙̂.\n\n• On the surface (r = R)\n  K = σ_b v = (aR)[ωR 𝜙̂] = a ω R² 𝜙̂.\n\nThe net effect of these circulating currents is to “build up” a magnetic dipole moment. (Although there is no free “magnetization” given at the outset, the motion of bound charges is equivalent to a magnetization M_eff.) One common method is to compute the magnetic moment per unit length. In general one may write\n\n  (magnetic moment)_z per unit length = (1/2)∫(r (J_φ)) dA  (13)\n\nwhere the integration is over the cross–section. (The “z”–component is picked out by the vector product.) Let us calculate the contributions.\n\n(a) Volume contribution: In cylindrical coordinates the infinitesimal area element is dA = 2πr dr, so\n  m_z^(vol) = (1/2)∫_0^R r [J_φ(r)] (2πr dr).\nHere J_φ(r) = –2a ω r so that\n  m_z^(vol) = (1/2)∫_0^R r [–2a ω r] (2π r dr)\n      = –2πaω ∫_0^R r³ dr\n      = –2πaω (R⁴/4) = –(π a ω R⁴)/2.  (14)\n\n(b) Surface contribution: The magnetic moment per unit length from a surface current flowing around a loop is given by\n  m_z^(surf) = (1/2) R [K] (circumference),\ni.e.,\n  m_z^(surf) = (1/2) R (a ω R²) (2πR) = π a ω R⁴.  (15)\n\nThus the total magnetic moment per unit length is\n  m_z = m_z^(vol) + m_z^(surf) = –(πaω R⁴)/2 + (πaω R⁴) = (πaω R⁴)/2.  (16)\n\nIt is often useful to express the net effect as that of a uniform “effective magnetization” given by\n  M_eff = m_z / (area) = [(πaωR⁴)/2] / (π R²) = (aωR²)/2.  (17)\n\nFor an infinitely long cylinder uniformly magnetized along its (z)–axis, the magnetostatics is well known. (In fact, the demagnetizing factor along the z–axis is zero when the cylinder is infinite.) Thus one immediately concludes that the magnetic induction in the interior is given by\n\n  B = μ₀ M_eff = (μ₀ a ω R²)/2   (in the z–direction)\nor\n  B = (μ₀ a ω R²/2) ẑ   for r < R.\n\nFurthermore, it is a standard result that for a uniformly magnetized infinite cylinder the stray (dipolar) fields vanish outside (since the only “magnetic charges” would reside on the ends, which here are sent to infinity). Hence we take\n\n  B = 0   for r > R.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 3. The Energy Stored in the Fields \n───────────────────────────── \nThe electromagnetic energy per unit volume in the fields is (in SI units)\n\n  u_E = (ε₀/2)E²,  and   u_B = B²/(2μ₀).  (18)\n\n(i) Before the cylinder is spun the magnetic field is zero so only the (electric) energy stored in E matters. We found that only the region r < R has a nonzero field:\n  E = –(a/ε₀) r   (so that |E| = a r/ε₀).\nThus the electric energy per unit length is\n  Uₑ = ∫_0^R (ε₀/2) (a²r²/ε₀²) (2πr dr)\n      = (a²/(2ε₀)) (2π) ∫_0^R r³ dr\n      = (πa²/(ε₀)) (R⁴/4)\n      = (π a² R⁴)/(4 ε₀).  (19)\n\n(ii) When the cylinder is spinning the fields are the superposition of the unaltered electric field (since in the non‐relativistic limit the static polarization gives the same E‐field) and the new magnetic field which is nonzero inside. (There is no magnetic field outside.) We already found that\n  B = (μ₀aω R²)/2 ẑ for r < R.\nThus the magnetic energy density is\n\n  u_B = B²/(2μ₀) = [μ₀²a²ω²R⁴/(4)]/(2μ₀) = (μ₀ a² ω² R⁴)/(8).\nSince B is uniform in the interior the magnetic energy per unit length is\n\n  U_B = (μ₀ a² ω² R⁴)/(8) × (area) with area = πR²,\nso that\n  U_B = (π μ₀ a² ω² R⁶)/(8).  (20)\n\nThus the total field energy per unit length when spinning is\n\n  U_total = Uₑ + U_B = (π a² R⁴)/(4 ε₀) + (π μ₀ a² ω² R⁶)/(8).\n\nFinally, one may ask: where did the extra energy come from? In short, when one spins up the cylinder an external “torque” must do work to overcome the electromagnetic “back‐reaction” (the extra magnetic energy stored in the process). That extra energy appears in the new B–field.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers \n───────────────────────────── \nWe now summarize our results.\n\n(a) The electric field is\n  for r < R:  E = –(a r/ε₀)𝑟̂,\n  for r > R:  E = 0.\n\n(b) The magnetic field (due to the moving bound charges) is\n  for r < R:  B = (μ₀ a ω R²/2) ẑ,\n  for r > R:  B = 0.\n\n(c) The electromagnetic energy per unit length is\n\n  (i) Before spinning (only the E–field):\n    Uₑ = (π a² R⁴)/(4ε₀).\n\n  (ii) While spinning (electric plus magnetic energies):\n    U_total = (π a² R⁴)/(4ε₀) + (π μ₀ a² ω² R⁶)/(8).\n\nThe extra energy in (ii) comes from the work done by the external agent (the applied torque) in setting the cylinder into rotation.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer in LaTeX Boxed Form\n───────────────────────────── \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & E(r)=\\begin{cases}\n-\\dfrac{a}{\\epsilon_0}\\,r\\,\\hat{r}, & r<R,\\\\[1mm]\n0, & r>R,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & B(r)=\\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{\\mu_0\\,a\\,\\omega R^2}{2}\\,\\hat{z}, & r<R,\\\\[1mm]\n0, & r>R,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\text{(i) } U_E=\\dfrac{\\pi a^2 R^4}{4\\epsilon_0},\\\\[1mm]\n& \\text{(ii) } U_{\\rm total}=\\dfrac{\\pi a^2 R^4}{4\\epsilon_0}+\\dfrac{\\pi\\mu_0\\,a^2\\omega^2R^6}{8}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nAny answer equivalent to the one above is correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & E(r)=\\begin{cases}\n-\\dfrac{a}{\\epsilon_0}\\,r\\,\\hat{r}, & r<R,\\\\[1mm]\n0, & r>R,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & B(r)=\\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{\\mu_0\\,a\\,\\omega R^2}{2}\\,\\hat{z}, & r<R,\\\\[1mm]\n0, & r>R,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\text{(i) } U_E=\\dfrac{\\pi a^2 R^4}{4\\epsilon_0},\\\\[1mm]\n& \\text{(ii) } U_{\\rm total}=\\dfrac{\\pi a^2 R^4}{4\\epsilon_0}+\\dfrac{\\pi\\mu_0\\,a^2\\omega^2R^6}{8}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & E(r)=\\begin{cases}\n-\\dfrac{a}{\\epsilon_0}\\,r\\,\\hat{r}, & r<R,\\\\[1mm]\n0, & r>R,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & B(r)=\\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{\\mu_0\\,a\\,\\omega R^2}{2}\\,\\hat{z}, & r<R,\\\\[1mm]\n0, & r>R,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\text{(i) } U_E=\\dfrac{\\pi a^2 R^4}{4\\epsilon_0},\\\\[1mm]\n& \\text{(ii) } U_{\\rm total}=\\dfrac{\\pi a^2 R^4}{4\\epsilon_0}+\\dfrac{\\pi\\mu_0\\,a^2\\omega^2R^6}{8}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{E} = \n\\begin{cases} \n-\\frac{ar}{\\epsilon_0} \\mathbf{e}_r, & r < R, \\\\\n0, & r > R.\n\\end{cases}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

(In practice the two halves repel one another, and an external force of equal magnitude is needed to keep them together.) One standard way to attack this problem is through the concept of electrostatic pressure (or “tension”) on a charged surface.\n\nStep 1. Electrostatic pressure on a conductor\n\nFor a charged conductor the electric field just outside is perpendicular to the surface and has magnitude\n\n  E = σ/ε₀\n\nwhere σ is the surface charge density. (Inside a conductor E = 0.) However, one must be a little careful in computing the force on a “piece” of the conductor. In fact, one may show that the net force per unit area (or pressure) that the other charges exert on a given patch is\n\n  P = σ²/(4ε₀).\n\nOne way to understand this is the following:\n • If one considered the field produced by an infinite charged plane (with surface charge σ) one would get E = σ/(2ε₀) on either side.\n • For a small patch of a conductor the field produced by all of the other charges is then the average of the field “just outside” (i.e. half of σ/ε₀) so that effectively the field acting on the charges on the patch is E_ext = σ/(2ε₀).\n • The force per unit area on that patch is then (½)(σE_ext) = σ²/(4ε₀).

Apply to the flat “cut‐face”\n\nWhen the sphere is intact the charge Q is spread uniformly over its outer surface. For a sphere the total area is 4πR² so that\n  σ = Q/(4πR²).\n\nWhen the sphere is “cut” into hemispheres the two halves (if they were simply separated, with the same charge distribution as before) would “pull” on one another. It turns out that the net repulsive force between the two halves comes solely from the interaction across the flat, circular cut. (The curved surfaces—with their charge distribution—are self-contained.)\n\nWe now consider that flat circular face (of radius R, area A = πR²).

{"id": "electro/2_28", "solution": "We will show one way to “design‐by‐calculation” an electromagnet producing a field B = 10,000 gauss (i.e. 1 tesla) in a 0.1‐m gap whose pole faces are 1 m by 2 m (area A = 2 m²). We assume that a high‐µ iron yoke is used so that nearly all of the “magnetic reluctance” is in the gap. (Any answer that gives results equivalent to what follows is acceptable.) \n\n• Step 1. Determine the mmf (magnetomotive force) required\n\nIn a magnetic circuit the dominant drop is in the air gap. In the gap the magnetic field intensity is\n\n  H = B/µ₀     (µ₀ = 4π×10^(–7) H/m).\n\nThus with B = 1 T,\n  H = 1/(4π×10^(–7)) ≃ 7.96×10^5 A/m.\n\nSince the gap has length g = 0.1 m the total mmf needed is\n\n  NI = H·g ≃ 7.96×10^5 A/m × 0.1 m ≃ 80,000 A‐turns.\n\n• Step 2. Choosing the maximum current density\n\nWe wish to “use as little copper as possible”. That is achieved if we run the coil at its maximum “engineering” current density. We are given\n  Jₘₐₓ = 1000 A/cm².\nRemember that 1 A/cm² = 10⁴ A/m², so\n\n  Jₘₐₓ = 1000 × 10⁴ A/m² = 1×10⁷ A/m².\n\nNow, if a current I is chosen in the conductor, then the cross‐sectional area of the copper needed in that “wire” is\n\n  A_wire = I/Jₘₐₓ.\n\nThe design must supply NI = 80,000 A‐turns. If we use N turns running at current I then\n  N = 80,000/I.\n\nSuppose the coil is wound “around” the pole pieces. (For example, if the pole face is 1×2 m, a “winding” loop that roughly goes around the pole may have an average length L_turn of about 6 m – e.g. the perimeter of a 1 m×2 m rectangle.) With this assumption the total length of copper is\n\n  L_total = N · L_turn = (80,000/I)·L_turn.\n\nSince each turn has a cross‐section A_wire = I/Jₘₐₓ, the total volume of copper is\n\n  V = N·L_turn · A_wire = (80,000/I)·L_turn · (I/Jₘₐₓ) = (80,000·L_turn)/Jₘₐₓ.\n\nNotice that I cancels! (This is typical: if you use the maximum allowed current density the total copper cross‐section is “pinned” by the mmf requirement.) Putting in the numbers with L_turn = 6 m,\n\n  V = (80,000 × 6) / (1×10⁷) = 480,000/1×10⁷ = 0.048 m³.\n\nNow, the density of copper is given as 8 g/cm³. In SI units 1 g/cm³ = 1000 kg/m³ so\n\n  ρ_cu = 8×1000 = 8000 kg/m³.\n\nThus the mass of copper required is\n\n  m_cu = ρ_cu · V = 8000 kg/m³ × 0.048 m³ = 384 kg.\n\n• Step 3. Determine the electrical “loss” (power consumption)\n\nThe electrical resistivity of copper is given as 2×10^(–6) ohm‐cm. Convert this to ohm–m:\n  ρ = 2×10^(–6) ohm‐cm × (1 m/100 cm) = 2×10^(–8) ohm‐m.\n\nLet’s now compute the resistance of one turn. Each turn (of length L_turn) is a long “wire” of cross‐section A_wire = I/Jₘₐₓ. Its resistance is\n\n  r_turn = ρ · (L_turn/A_wire) = ρ · (L_turn/(I/Jₘₐₓ)) = ρ · L_turn · (Jₘₐₓ/I).\n\nBecause the turns are connected in series the total resistance is\n\n  R_total = N · r_turn = (80,000/I) · [ρ L_turn (Jₘₐₓ/I)]\n       = 80,000 · ρ · L_turn · Jₘₐₓ / I².\n\nNow the power dissipated in the coil is\n\n  P = I² · R_total = I² · (80,000 ρ L_turn Jₘₐₓ/I²) = 80,000 · ρ L_turn Jₘₐₓ.\n\nThat is independent of I provided we run at the maximum allowable J. Now plug in the numbers:\n\n  P = 80,000 × (2×10^(–8) ohm‐m) × 6 m × (1×10⁷ A/m²).\n\nCompute step‐by‐step:\n  2×10^(–8) × 1×10⁷ = 0.2,\n  0.2 × 6 = 1.2,\n  1.2 × 80,000 = 96,000 W.\n\nThus the coil will “waste” about 96 kW in resistive losses.\n\n• Step 4. Calculate the attraction force between the poles\n\nIn a gap the energy density (magnetic pressure) is\n\n  p = B²/(2µ₀).\n\nThis pressure, acting over the pole face area A, produces an attractive force\n\n  F = p · A = (B²/(2µ₀)) · A.\n\nHere B = 1 T, µ₀ = 4π×10^(–7) H/m, and A = 2 m². Then\n\n  F = (1/(2×4π×10^(–7))) × 2 = (1/(8π×10^(–7)))×2.\n\nFirst compute 8π×10^(–7): \n  8π ≃ 25.13, so 8π×10^(–7) ≃ 2.513×10^(–6).\n\nThen,\n  F = 2/(2.513×10^(–6)) ≃ 7.96×10⁵ N.\n\nThat is just under 8×10^5 newtons of force between the poles.\n\n• Summary of our “magnet design” results\n\n– Required mmf:  NI ≃ 80,000 A‐turns.\n– Minimum copper mass (using maximum current density): about 384 kg.\n– Resistive losses (power required to “drive” the magnet): about 96 kW.\n– Force of attraction between the poles: roughly 8×10^5 newtons.\n\nThus, one acceptable answer is:\n\n  Power ≃ 9.6×10^4 W, Copper mass ≃ 384 kg, Attractive force ≃ 8.0×10^5 N.\n\nFinally, our boxed final answer is\n\n  \\[\\boxed{\\text{Power } \\approx 9.6\\times10^4\\,\\text{W},\\quad m_{\\text{Cu}} \\approx 3.8\\times10^2\\,\\text{kg},\\quad F \\approx 8.0\\times10^5\\,\\text{N}}\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Power } \\approx 9.6\\times10^4\\,\\text{W},\\quad m_{\\text{Cu}} \\approx 3.8\\times10^2\\,\\text{kg},\\quad F \\approx 8.0\\times10^5\\,\\text{N}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Power } \\approx 9.6\\times10^4\\,\\text{W},\\quad m_{\\text{Cu}} \\approx 3.8\\times10^2\\,\\text{kg},\\quad F \\approx 8.0\\times10^5\\,\\text{N}", "expr2": "P = 9.5 \\times 10^4 \\ \\text{W}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Power } \\approx 9.6\\times10^4\\,\\text{W},\\quad m_{\\text{Cu}} \\approx 3.8\\times10^2\\,\\text{kg},\\quad F \\approx 8.0\\times10^5\\,\\text{N}", "expr2": "\\text{Weight} = 3.8 \\ \\text{kg}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Power } \\approx 9.6\\times10^4\\,\\text{W},\\quad m_{\\text{Cu}} \\approx 3.8\\times10^2\\,\\text{kg},\\quad F \\approx 8.0\\times10^5\\,\\text{N}", "expr2": "F = 8 \\times 10^5 \\ \\text{N}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

When the dielectric is only partly inserted (say with a length x inside the capacitor and a remaining length L – x filled with vacuum), the capacitor essentially becomes a combination of two capacitors in parallel (since the voltage V is the same along the length).

{"id": "electro/5_4", "solution": "We wish to determine the direction (relative to ship (1)’s “internal” axes) in which the package must be fired so that it later meets ship (2) and also to find its speed in ship (1)’s frame. (We will use units in which c is explicit.) In our laboratory (or “lab‐”) frame S the situation is as follows:\n\n• Ship (1) is moving upward (i.e. in the +y direction) with speed v = c/2.  \n• Ship (2) is moving in the opposite direction (i.e. –y) with speed c/2 (so that at the moment of closest approach the two ships have the same y–coordinate, but are separated by a distance d along the x–axis).  \n• At the moment of closest approach (when the ships have the same y–coordinate), ship (1) ejects a package with speed 3c/4 as measured in S. (Its direction, however, is to be chosen so that eventually it reaches ship (2).)\n\nOne may choose coordinates in S so that at the moment of closest approach (t = 0):\n\n – Ship 1 is at (x = 0, y = 0).  \n – Ship 2 is at (x = d, y = 0).  \n\nShip 1 moves with velocity (0, +c/2) and ship 2 with (0, –c/2).\n\nLet the package be ejected in S with speed 3c/4. Denote its components by\n\n  uₓ = (3c/4) sin φ  and  u_y = (3c/4) cos φ.\n\nOur job is to choose the angle φ so that, when we transform the package’s velocity into the ship (1) frame S′ (which is moving in the +y direction with speed c/2) the resulting velocity has a “vertical” (y–) component equal to that of ship (2) as seen in S′ – so that, starting from a horizontal separation, the package will “catch up” with ship (2).\n\nLet us now proceed step by step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Determine the velocity of ship (2) in ship (1)’s frame S′\n\nSince ship (1) moves with speed v = c/2 along y the Lorentz factor is\n\n  γ = 1/√(1−(v/c)²) = 1/√(1−1/4) = 2/√3.\n\nFor boosts along the y–direction the velocity–addition formulas are\n\n  u′ₓ = uₓ/(γ [1 − (v u_y/c²)]),\n  u′_y = (u_y − v)/[1 − (v u_y/c²)].\n\nShip (2) has S–velocity (0, –c/2), so its velocity in the ship–1 frame is\n\n  u′ₓ (ship 2) = 0,  \n  u′_y (ship 2) = (–c/2 – c/2)/[1 − ((c/2)(–c/2)/c²)]\n           = (–c)/(1 + 1/4) = –c/(5/4) = –4c/5.\n\nThus, in ship (1)’s frame S′ the second ship is moving purely vertically downward at speed 4c/5.\n\nAlso note: because the x–coordinate is perpendicular to the boost the spatial separation in that direction is the same as in S (i.e. d).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. The condition for a collision in ship–1’s frame\n\nIn S′ the package is ejected from the origin [ship (1)’s position] at time t′ = 0. Let its S′–velocity be (u′ₓ, u′_y). Ship (2) at t′ = 0 is at (x′ = d, y′ = 0) and moves with velocity (0, –4c/5). In order for the package (traveling in a straight line with constant velocity) to hit ship (2) the vertical components must match. That is, if the package takes a time t′ (in S′) to reach ship (2), then its displacement is\n\n  x′ = u′ₓ t′  and  y′ = u′_y t′.\n\nShip (2) has position\n\n  x′ = d,  y′ = –4c t′/5.\n\nFor the two paths to meet we must have\n\n  u′_y = –4c/5.         (1)\n\nSince ship (2) has no x–component in S′, the package must “gain” the x–distance d by its own x–component, but condition (1) is the crucial one for setting its vertical motion.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Transforming the package’s velocity from S to S′\n\nWe have chosen that in S the package is ejected with speed u = 3c/4 and components\n\n  uₓ = (3c/4) sin φ,  u_y = (3c/4) cos φ.\n\nIn a boost in the y–direction (with velocity v = c/2), the transformation formulas are:\n\n  u′ₓ = uₓ / [γ(1 − v u_y/c²)],  (2)\n  u′_y = (u_y − v)/[1 − v u_y/c²].  (3)\n\nOur requirement is that u′_y, given by (3), be –4c/5. That is,\n\n  (u_y − c/2)/[1 − (c/2)(u_y)/c²] = –4c/5,\n      where u_y = (3c/4) cos φ.\n\nLet us substitute:\n\nNumerator:\n  ( (3c/4) cos φ – c/2 ) = c (3 cos φ/4 − 1/2).\n\nDenominator:\n  1 − (c/2 * (3c/4 cos φ))/c² = 1 − (3 cos φ)/(8).\n\nThus the equation becomes\n\n  [c (3 cos φ/4 − 1/2)] / [1 − 3 cos φ/8] = –4c/5.\nCancel c (c ≠ 0) to get\n\n  (3 cos φ/4 − 1/2) / (1 − 3 cos φ/8) = –4/5.\nNow multiply both sides by (1 − 3 cos φ/8):\n\n  (3 cos φ/4 − 1/2) = –4/5 (1 − 3 cos φ/8).\nMultiply both sides by 20 (to clear denominators):\n\n  20 (3 cos φ/4 − 1/2) = –4*20/5 (1 − 3 cos φ/8),\nwhich simplifies as\n\n  15 cos φ − 10 = –16 + 6 cos φ.\nSolve for cos φ:\n\n  15 cos φ − 6 cos φ = –16 + 10,\n  9 cos φ = –6  ⟹  cos φ = –6/9 = –2/3.\nThus, φ = arccos(–2/3). (Since cos φ is negative, φ is in the second quadrant; that is, the package in S is fired “backwards” relative to ship (1)’s direction of motion.)\n\nIt is now useful to find the sine as well. Since\n\n  sin φ = √(1 − cos² φ) = √(1 − (4/9)) = √(5/9) = (√5)/3,\nand (because φ is between 90° and 180°) sin φ is positive.\n\nThus, the S–components of the package’s velocity are\n\n  uₓ = (3c/4) sin φ = (3c/4) · (√5/3) = c√5/4,\n  u_y = (3c/4) cos φ = (3c/4)·(–2/3) = –c/2.\n\nA quick check shows that the speed is indeed\n\n  √( (c√5/4)² + (–c/2)² ) = sqrt( (5c²/16) + (c²/4) )\n         = sqrt( (5c²/16)+(4c²/16) )\n         = √(9c²/16)= 3c/4.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Find the package’s velocity in ship–1’s frame\n\nWe now find u′ₓ from (2):\n\n  u′ₓ = uₓ / [γ (1 − v u_y/c²)].\n\nWe know uₓ = c√5/4, v = c/2, and u_y = –c/2 so that\n\n  v u_y/c² = (c/2)(–c/2)/c² = –1/4.\nThen\n\n  1 − (v u_y/c²)= 1 − (–1/4)= 1+frac{1}{4}= 5/4.\nWe already found γ = 2/√3. Hence\n\n  γ (5/4) = (2/√3)(5/4)= (10)/(4√3)= 5/(2√3).\nThus\n\n  u′ₓ = (c√5/4) / [5/(2√3)] = (c√5/4)·(2√3/5)= (c√15)/(10).\n\nAnd we already obtained u′_y from (3):\n\n  u′_y = (u_y – v)/(1 − v u_y/c²) = (–c/2 – c/2)/(5/4)= (–c)/(5/4) = –4c/5,\nwhich is exactly the requirement for a collision.\n\nThus, in ship–1’s frame S′ the package has velocity components\n\n  u′ₓ = c√15/10   and  u′_y = –4c/5.\n\nNow, in the coordinate system fixed in ship (1) the y–axis is taken to be the direction it is moving (upward in S) and the x–axis perpendicular. (Recall ship (1) is at rest in S′.) The package must be “aimed” in S′ at an angle θ with respect to the y–axis. (Positive x is chosen so that the target, ship (2), at x = d lies to the right.) Since u′ₓ is positive and u′_y is negative, the package’s velocity in S′ makes an angle below the +y–axis. The tangent of the angle (its magnitude) is given by\n\n  tan θ = (u′ₓ)/( |u′_y| ) = ( (c√15)/10 )/(4c/5) = (√15/10)/(4/5)\n         = (√15/10)·(5/4)= √15/8.\n\nThus, the answer to part (a) is:\n\n  The package must be aimed at an angle θ where\n\n    θ = arctan(√15/8)\n  (measured downward from the ship’s forward, i.e. +y, direction).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 5. Find the speed of the package in ship–1’s frame\n\nThe speed in S′, which we call u′, is given by\n\n  u′ = √((u′ₓ)² + (u′_y)²).\n\nWe have\n\n  (u′ₓ)² = (c√15/10)² = 15c²/100,\n  (u′_y)² = (4c/5)² = 16c²/25 = (64c²/100).\n\nThus\n\n  u′ = √((15c² + 64c²)/100) = √(79c²/100)= (c√79)/10.\n\nThis is the answer for part (b).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) In ship (1)’s frame the package must be aimed at an angle \n  θ = arctan(√15/8)\nbelow the y–axis.\n\n(b) Its speed in ship (1)’s frame is \n  u′ = (c√79)/10.\n\nThus, we have\n\n  \\[\n  \\boxed{\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  \\text{(a)}\\quad & \\theta = \\arctan\\!\\Bigl(\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{8}\\Bigr), \\\\\n  \\text{(b)}\\quad & u' = \\frac{c\\sqrt{79}}{10}\\,.\n  \\end{aligned}\n  }\n  \\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n  \\text{(a)}\\quad & \\theta = \\arctan\\!\\Bigl(\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{8}\\Bigr), \\\\\n  \\text{(b)}\\quad & u' = \\frac{c\\sqrt{79}}{10}\\,.\n  \\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n  \\text{(a)}\\quad & \\theta = \\arctan\\!\\Bigl(\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{8}\\Bigr), \\\\\n  \\text{(b)}\\quad & u' = \\frac{c\\sqrt{79}}{10}\\,.\n  \\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\alpha' = \\arctan \\left( \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{15}} \\right)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n  \\text{(a)}\\quad & \\theta = \\arctan\\!\\Bigl(\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{8}\\Bigr), \\\\\n  \\text{(b)}\\quad & u' = \\frac{c\\sqrt{79}}{10}\\,.\n  \\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{\\sqrt{79}}{10} \\, c"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "electro/1_65", "solution": "We start by noting that a perfect conductor must have zero electric field inside. When a conducting sphere of radius R is placed in an external uniform electric field E₀ (directed along the z‐axis), free charges redistribute on its surface until the potential on the surface is constant.

Notice that on the surface, r = R, the potential is\n\n  φ(R, θ) = –E₀ cosθ (R – R) = 0,\n\nso that the sphere is indeed an equipotential.\n\nStep 1. Determining the Surface Charge Density\n\nThe surface charge density σ on a conductor is related to the discontinuity of the normal component of the electric field at the surface. Since the field inside is zero, we have\n\n  σ = ε₀ Eₙ     (1)\n\nwhere Eₙ is the normal component of the electric field just outside the surface (with the normal taken to be outward).\n\nThe electric field is given by E = –∇φ.

We assume azimuthal symmetry so that the potential depends on r and θ only.\n\nStep 1. Write the potentials.\n\nFor r > a (outside the sphere), we expect the solution to be the sum of the uniform field and an induced dipole term.

The above derivation leads us to\n\n  B (ε₁ – 2ε₂) = –ε₂ E₀  ⟹ B = –(ε₂/(ε₁ – 2ε₂)) E₀.\n\nThere is, however, a standard well‐known result, and the “–” sign should not be present when properly combined with the sign conventions of the potential. Let us re‐derive this carefully.\n\nRecall the electric field is given by E = –∇φ. When we impose the continuity of D_r, the respective derivatives are taken from the potentials (with the minus already in the definition of the field). Alternatively, we can work directly with the potentials by writing down the derivative of the potential and applying the jump condition for D. Let’s start over and carefully keep track of the minus signs.\n\nWe have:\n  E_in = –∇φ_in,  E_out = –∇φ_out.\nThus,\n  For r < a: E_{r}^{in} = –∂/∂r (–B r cos θ) = B cos θ.\n  For r > a: E_{r}^{out} = –∂/∂r (–E₀ r cos θ + A cos θ/r²) = E₀ cos θ + (2A cos θ)/r³.\n\nNow the boundary condition on the displacement is that the normal (radial) component satisfies:\n\n  ε₁ E^{in}_r = ε₂ E^{out}_r at r = a.\n\nThus,\n\n  ε₁ B cos θ = ε₂ [E₀ cos θ + 2A cos θ/a³].\n\nCancel cos θ:\n\n  ε₁ B = ε₂ [E₀ + 2A/a³].  (2′)\n\nNow, using (1) A = a³(E₀ – B), substitute into (2′):\n\n  ε₁ B = ε₂ [E₀ + 2(E₀ – B)] = ε₂ (E₀ + 2E₀ – 2B) = ε₂ (3E₀ – 2B).\n\nNow solve for B:\n\n  ε₁ B + 2ε₂ B = 3ε₂ E₀  ⟹ B (ε₁ + 2ε₂) = 3ε₂ E₀  ⟹ B = (3ε₂/(ε₁+2ε₂)) E₀.  (3)\n\nThen, from (1),\n\n  A = a³ [E₀ – (3ε₂/(ε₁+2ε₂))E₀] = a³ E₀ [(ε₁+2ε₂ – 3ε₂)/(ε₁+2ε₂)] = a³ E₀ (ε₁ – ε₂)/(ε₁+2ε₂).  (4)\n\nThus the potentials are:\n\nFor r < a: \n  φ_in(r,θ) = –B r cos θ = –(3ε₂/(ε₁+2ε₂))E₀ r cos θ.\nFor r > a:\n  φ_out(r,θ) = –E₀ r cos θ + (a³ (ε₁–ε₂)/(ε₁+2ε₂))(cos θ)/r².\n\nStep 3. Write the Electric Fields\n\nThe electric field is the negative gradient of the potential.

It is sometimes more convenient to express the total field in vector form. One standard form is\n\n  E_out = E₀ + ( [3( p·r̂) r̂ – p] /r³ ),\n\nwhere the induced dipole moment is given by\n\n  p = 4πε₀^* a³ ( (ε₁–ε₂)/(ε₁+2ε₂) ) E₀.\n\n(In our problem, we are working with dielectrics and no free charges so the factor 4πε₀ might be absorbed in the dielectric constants, depending on the system of units.

In fact, the ideal inverse 1 + sRC is an “improper” function (the numerator is of higher order than the denominator) so that if one tried to realize it using only resistors and capacitors one would run into problems with causality and energy dissipation. (Remember, in a passive RC network one is always “losing” energy – there is no “storage‐and‐return” mechanism available to provide an amplification that would be required over part of the frequency range.)\n\nIt turns out that if one wishes to implement the exact inverse transfer function (compensating the RC–filter exactly over the entire frequency range), then one cannot do it with a single “mirror–image” RC network. In fact, to synthesize an ideal compensator one might try either\n\n (a) to “build up” the singular behavior (the derivative) as an infinite series of RC–filters, which in effect would be the causal approximation of the non–causal operator 1+sRC, or \n\n (c) use a simple single RC high–pass stage—which, as we have seen, only approximates the derivative over a finite band.\n\nThe only “exact” solution is by using networks that are not made solely of resistors and capacitors. In a lossless network the energy stored in inductors and capacitors can be exchanged without dissipation. In fact, LC circuits can be arranged (using network synthesis techniques – see Foster’s or Cauer’s forms) to realize a precisely “inverting” compensator (when an appropriate delay is taken into account). Thus one finds that exactly canceling the RC low–pass filter is possible only with an LC–filter network.\n\nStep–by–step summary:\n1.

{"id": "electro/1_31", "solution": "We wish to study the “lab‐sheet” cylindrical capacitor shown below. The inner (cylindrical) conductor of radius r₁ is held at a positive potential V₀ while the outer conductor (of radius r₂) is grounded (V = 0). (All quantities are understood as “per unit length” in what follows.) We will work out, step by step, the three parts of the problem.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Find the electric field (Part a)\n\nBecause of the cylindrical symmetry the electric field in the region between the conductors (that is, for r₁ < r < r₂) will point radially, and depend only on the distance r. (Here r is the distance from the axis.) We choose a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius r and length L (with r₁ < r < r₂). Then by Gauss’s law\n\n  ∮ E · dA = E(r) (2πrL) = Q_enc/ε₀\n\nand the enclosed charge per unit length is λ so that Q_enc = λL. Thus\n\n  E(r) = λ/(2πε₀r).              (1)\n\nNow we have not yet expressed our answer in terms of the given potential V₀. However, the potential difference V₀ between the inner (r = r₁) and outer (r = r₂) conductors is given by\n\n  V₀ = V(r₁) – V(r₂) = –∫₍r₁₎⁽r₂⁾ E(r) dr\n    = –∫₍r₁₎⁽r₂⁾ (λ/(2πε₀r)) dr = – (λ/(2πε₀)) ln(r₂/r₁).\n\nSince the outer conductor is at zero potential and the inner is at V₀ we must have V₀ > 0; therefore, writing the equation in a slightly different way we choose\n  V₀ = (λ/(2πε₀))ln(r₂/r₁)\nwhich implies\n  λ = (2πε₀V₀)/ln(r₂/r₁).\n\nSubstitute this value for λ into Eq. (1) to find\n\n  E(r) =  (V₀/(r ln(r₂/r₁))).      (a)\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Find the potential at r (Part b)\n\nA convenient way to fix the sign is to start from the inner conductor. We know that the inner conductor is at V(r₁)= V₀ and that the potential decreases as r increases (since the field points radially outward). Thus, the potential at any r between r₁ and r₂ is\n\n  V(r) = V(r₁) – ∫₍r₁₎⁽r⁾ E(r′)dr′\n     = V₀ – ∫₍r₁₎⁽r⁾ (V₀/(r′ ln(r₂/r₁))) dr′\n     = V₀ – [V₀/(ln(r₂/r₁))] ln(r/r₁)\n     = V₀ [1 – (ln(r/r₁))/(ln(r₂/r₁))].\n\nIt is often useful to rewrite this in an equivalent form. Noting that\n\n  1 – (ln(r/r₁))/(ln(r₂/r₁)) = (ln(r₂/r₁) – ln(r/r₁))/(ln(r₂/r₁))\n            = ln(r₂/r)/ln(r₂/r₁),\n  so that\n\n  V(r) = V₀ [ln(r₂/r)]/ln(r₂/r₁).   (b)\n\nNotice that indeed when r = r₁ we have ln(r₂/r₁) in the numerator and denominator so that V(r₁)= V₀, and when r = r₂ we get ln(1) = 0 so that V(r₂)= 0, as required.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Determine the change of charge on the inner conductor (Part c)\n\nSuppose now that a very small negative charge Q (we assume Q is “small” so that it does not appreciably disturb the field–i.e. it is a test charge) is initially at some radius r (with r₁ < r < r₂) and then it drifts until it reaches the inner conductor. Because the inner conductor is maintained (by a battery, say) at the fixed potential V₀, a flow of charge from the battery (or to the battery) is necessary to keep the potential constant. (See, for example, the discussion of “work done by the battery” in many texts.) One way to deduce the amount of battery–supplied charge Δq is to use energy conservation.\n\nBefore the move the test charge has potential energy QV(r) and after it is on the inner conductor its potential energy is QV(r₁) = QV₀. (Keep in mind that Q is negative.) Thus the change in the potential energy of the test charge is\n\n  ΔU = Q [V(r₁) – V(r)] = Q [V₀ – V(r)].\n\nBecause the process is “slow” (or quasi static) so that the total energy remains fixed, the battery must do work equal to\n\n  W_bat = –ΔU = –Q [V₀ – V(r)].\n\nBut since the battery is kept at a fixed potential V₀, the work done in transferring an extra charge Δq onto the inner conductor is simply\n\n  W_bat = V₀ Δq.\n\nThus we equate\n\n  V₀ Δq = –Q [V₀ – V(r)]\nor\n  Δq = Q [V(r) – V₀] / V₀.\n                 (2)\n\nIt is often preferable to write this answer in a form that makes use of our expression (b) for V(r). Inserting that result we get\n\n  Δq = Q {V₀[ln(r₂/r)]/ln(r₂/r₁) – V₀} / V₀\n     = Q { [ln(r₂/r) – ln(r₂/r₁)]/ln(r₂/r₁) }\n     = –Q [ ln(r/r₂) + ln(r₂/r₁) – ln(r₂/r₁) ]/ln(r₂/r₁)\n     = –Q [ ln(r/r₁) ]/ln(r₂/r₁).   (c)\n\nOne may check the limiting cases. For instance, if the test charge is taken from the outer conductor where r = r₂, then ln(r₂/r₁) is not zero but ln(r₂/r₂) = 0 and then Δq = 0 – that is, no extra charge is needed because a charge taken from r₂ (which is already grounded) would have the same potential as the outer conductor. On the other hand, if the test charge is taken from very near the inner conductor (r very nearly equal to r₁) then ln(r/r₁) ≈ 0 so that Δq ≈ 0. In between the battery must supply a certain amount of charge in order to “compensate” for the fact that the test charge is lowered in potential before arriving at the inner conductor.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The electric field between the conductors is\n\n  E(r) = V₀/(r ln(r₂/r₁))  for r₁ < r < r₂.\n\n(b) The potential at radius r is\n\n  V(r) = V₀ [ln(r₂/r)]/ln(r₂/r₁).\n\n(c) When a small negative charge Q drifts from r to the inner conductor, the battery must supply an extra charge\n\n  Δq = Q { [ln(r₂/r) – ln(r₂/r₁)]/V₀ } V₀   (or, equivalently)\n      = –Q [ln(r/r₁)]/ln(r₂/r₁).\n\nWriting the final results in boxed LaTeX we have:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &E(r)=\\frac{V_0}{r\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\right)}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &V(r)=V_0\\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_2}{r}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\right)}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\Delta q=-Q\\,\\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{r}{r_1}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nAny answer equivalent to the boxed expressions above is correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &E(r)=\\frac{V_0}{r\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\right)}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &V(r)=V_0\\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_2}{r}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\right)}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\Delta q=-Q\\,\\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{r}{r_1}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &E(r)=\\frac{V_0}{r\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\right)}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &V(r)=V_0\\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_2}{r}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\right)}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\Delta q=-Q\\,\\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{r}{r_1}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "E(r) = \\frac{V_0}{\\ln(r_2/r_1)} \\frac{1}{r}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

The important point is that although the polarization (its magnitude and functional form) does not change, the bound charges now are moving, and their motion constitutes a current.

{"id": "electro/3_29", "solution": "We begin by writing Faraday’s law for the loop. When the electromagnet is turned on, the magnetic flux through the circular loop changes from zero to\n\n  Φ = B (πa²),\n\nsince the loop’s area is A = πa².\n\nBecause the magnetic field is uniform over the loop and the field lines are perpendicular to the plane of the loop (its plane is parallel to the pole faces), the flux is simply\n\n  Φ = Bπa².\n\nFaraday’s law tells us that the induced emf in the loop is\n\n  ℰ = - dΦ/dt.\n\nIn our case, as the field is switched on from 0 to B (over some time interval), the changing flux produces an emf which drives a current I in the loop. Applying Kirchhoff’s loop rule, taking into account the self-inductance L and the total resistance R, the circuit equation is\n\n  L (dI/dt) + R I = - dΦ/dt.\n\nOur goal is to find the total electric charge q that flows past any point on the loop. This total charge is given by integrating the current over time:\n\n  q = ∫₀⁽∞⁾ I(t) dt.\n\nTo find q, integrate the entire circuit equation with respect to time from t = 0 (when the field is off and the current is zero) until t = ∞ (when the current eventually goes to zero because the emf has vanished after the flux stops changing).\n\nIntegrate each term in the circuit equation:\n\n  ∫₀⁽∞⁾ [L (dI/dt) + R I] dt = - ∫₀⁽∞⁾ dΦ/dt dt.\n\nLet’s evaluate the left-hand side term by term.\n\n1. For the inductor term:\n\n  ∫₀⁽∞⁾ L (dI/dt) dt = L [I(∞) - I(0)].\n\nSince the current starts at zero, I(0) = 0, and after the field has been switched on and the transient dies out, there is no more induced emf and the current decays back to zero so that I(∞) = 0. (Note that although a momentary current flows during the change in flux, the final steady state has I = 0 because there is no source maintaining a current in the loop.) Thus, the inductor term becomes\n\n  L [I(∞) - I(0)] = L (0 - 0) = 0.\n\n2.

In the transmitted region, this is automatically ensured by Snell’s law, namely, the continuity of the x–component requires \n  k₀ sinθ = k'_x,\nor, if one defines an “angle” γ in the medium by writing k'_x = k' sinγ, then k' sinγ = k₀ sinθ.)\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (c): Derive the Wave Equation in the Transmitted Region\n\nIn the region z > 0 the medium is inhomogeneous so that ε depends on z.

In many cases (and here, with no free charges) one may choose the gauge such that ∇·E = 0.

{"id": "electro/3_10", "solution": "Below is one common way to solve a problem like “Calculate the energy in the 3 μF capacitor in Fig. 3.17” when the network is that of a battery supplying two branches—one branch having a series pair of capacitors (3 μF and 6 μF) and the other branch having a 2 μF capacitor. (This is the circuit used in many textbooks; see, for example, Fig. 3.17 in some texts.) In our analysis we assume that the battery voltage is 12 V. (If the battery voltage were different, the answer would scale accordingly.) \n\nLet’s step through the solution:\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 1. Identify the Network and Its Simplification\n\nSuppose we have the following circuit:\n • A 12 V battery is connected to two branches (the branches are in parallel, so the voltage across each branch is 12 V).\n • In Branch A the 3 μF capacitor is in series with the 6 μF capacitor.\n • In Branch B there is a single 2 μF capacitor.\n\nBecause the branches are in parallel the voltage across each branch is 12 V.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 2. Find the Equivalent Capacitance of the Series Pair\n\nFor two capacitors in series the equivalent capacitance is given by\n  C_series = (C₁C₂)/(C₁ + C₂).\n\nSubstitute C₁ = 3 μF and C₂ = 6 μF:\n  C_series = (3 μF · 6 μF)/(3 μF + 6 μF) = (18 μF²)/(9 μF) = 2 μF.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 3. Determine the Charge on the Series Branch\n\nSince the 2 μF (the equivalent capacitance of the series combination) is connected directly across the 12 V supply, the charge on that branch is \n  Q_series = C_series · V = (2 μF)(12 V) = 24 μC.\n\nRemember that for capacitors in series the same charge appears on each capacitor. \n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 4. Find the Voltage Across the 3 μF Capacitor\n\nIn the series branch the 3 μF capacitor has the same charge Q_series = 24 μC.

Calculate the Energy Stored in the 3 μF Capacitor\n\nThe energy stored in a capacitor is \n  U = ½ C V².\n\nSubstitute C = 3 μF and V = 8 V:\n  U = ½ · (3×10⁻⁶ F) · (8 V)² \n     = ½ · 3×10⁻⁶ · 64 \n     = (1.5×10⁻⁶) · 64 \n     = 96×10⁻⁶ J \n     = 96 μJ.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer\n\nThus, with a 12 V battery the energy stored in the 3 μF capacitor is\n\n  \\[\\boxed{96\\,\\mu\\text{J}}\\]\n\nNote: If the battery voltage in Fig. 3.17 is different, the numerical answer must be scaled accordingly (since U ∝ V²).", "final_answers": ["96\\,\\mu\\text{J}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "96\\,\\mu\\text{J}", "expr2": "E = 0.42 \\times 10^{-6} \\, J"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "electro/4_22", "solution": "We will show below one acceptable way of attacking the problem. In what follows we assume that the medium is non‐absorbing (so that all Fresnel coefficients are real at normal incidence) and that the incident medium is vacuum (with refractive index 1). (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.)\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 1. Reflected wave from an infinite half‐space\n\nAt normal incidence the two “eigen–polarizations” are simply the x– and y–polarizations. In vacuum the incident electric field is assumed to be polarized at 45° to the x and y axes so that\n  E_inc = (E₀/√2)(x̂ + ŷ).\n\nWhen the wave is incident normally on a half–space with different dielectric constants along x and y the “Fresnel reflection coefficients” for the two polarizations are\n  rₓ = (1 – nₓ)/(1 + nₓ),  r_y = (1 – n_y)/(1 + n_y),\nsince the refractive indices for the two directions are nₓ and n_y respectively. (Notice that no mixing occurs because the dielectric tensor is diagonal in the given coordinate system.)\n\nThus the reflected field will be\n  E_r = (E₀/√2)[rₓ x̂ + r_y ŷ].\nSince the coefficients rₓ and r_y are real (a property of nonabsorbing media at normal incidence) the two components of the reflected field have no additional phase difference. Hence even though the amplitudes are different, the combination\n  E_r = E₀ₓ x̂ + E₀_y ŷ  with E₀ₓ = (E₀/√2) rₓ and E₀_y = (E₀/√2) r_y,\nremains linearly polarized. Its polarization direction is rotated with respect to 45° by an angle θ given by\n  tanθ = E₀_y/E₀ₓ = r_y/rₓ.\nThus, (a) the reflected wave is linearly polarized but its polarization direction is rotated away from 45° (unless rₓ = r_y, i.e. unless nₓ = n_y).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 2. Transmitted wave through a slab of thickness d\n\nNow let the same plane wave impinge on a slab of finite thickness d. In passing through the slab both x–and y–components accumulate a phase and suffer amplitude changes as given by the Fresnel transmission coefficients at the “entry” and “exit” surfaces as well as by propagation in the anisotropic material. (We assume no multiple‐reflection effects or, equivalently, that the transmitted field is the “net” result of the Fabry–Perot resonance.)\n\nAt normal incidence the Fresnel transmission coefficient (amplitude) for an interface from vacuum into a medium of refractive index nᵢ is \n  tᵢ = 2/(1+nᵢ)   (for i = x or y).\nSimilarly, on going from the medium (of refractive index nᵢ) back into vacuum the transmission coefficient is \n  tᵢ' = 2nᵢ/(1+nᵢ).\nThus if we (for simplicity) neglect multiple internal reflections the net transmission amplitude for the ith polarization is\n  Tᵢ = tᵢ tᵢ' e^(i nᵢ ωd/c) = [4nᵢ/(1+nᵢ)²] e^(i nᵢ ωd/c).\nSince the incident field is E_inc = (E₀/√2)(x̂ + ŷ), the transmitted field components are\n  E_t,x = (E₀/√2) Tₓ = (E₀/√2) [4nₓ/(1+nₓ)²] e^(i nₓ ωd/c)\n  E_t,y = (E₀/√2) T_y = (E₀/√2) [4n_y/(1+n_y)²] e^(i n_y ωd/c).\n\nThus the ratio of the x– and y–components of the transmitted field is\n  E_t,x/E_t,y = [4nₓ/(1+nₓ)²] / [4n_y/(1+n_y)²] · e^(i ωd/c (nₓ – n_y))\n         = (nₓ/n_y) [(1+n_y)/(1+nₓ)]² e^(i ωd/c (nₓ – n_y)).\nThat is, the relative amplitude is (nₓ/n_y)[(1+n_y)/(1+nₓ)]², and in addition the x–component leads (or lags) the y–component by a phase ωd(nₓ – n_y)/c. In general, for nₓ ≠ n_y the transmitted wave is elliptically polarized since the two components have different amplitudes and a relative phase shift.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) When the slab is infinitely thick (i.e. a half–space), the x– and y–components of the reflected wave are\n  rₓ = (1–nₓ)/(1+nₓ),  r_y = (1–n_y)/(1+n_y),\nso that if the incident field is polarized at 45° (E_inc ∝ x̂ + ŷ) the reflected field is\n  E_r ∝ rₓ x̂ + r_y ŷ.\nSince rₓ and r_y are real the polarization remains linear but its direction is rotated relative to 45° by an angle given by\n  tan θ = r_y/rₓ.\n\n(b) For a slab of thickness d the transmitted field (neglecting multiple reflections) is given by\n  E_t,x = (E₀/√2)[4nₓ/(1+nₓ)²] e^(i nₓ ωd/c),\n  E_t,y = (E₀/√2)[4n_y/(1+n_y)²] e^(i n_y ωd/c).\nThus the relative amplitude and phase between the x– and y–components is\n  E_t,x/E_t,y = (nₓ/n_y)[(1+n_y)/(1+nₓ)]² e^(i ωd/c (nₓ – n_y)).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer in Boxed Latex\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\mathbf{E}_r = \\frac{E_0}{\\sqrt{2}}\\Bigl( \\frac{1-n_x}{1+n_x}\\,\\hat{x} + \\frac{1-n_y}{1+n_y}\\,\\hat{y}\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{so that the reflected wave is linearly polarized with its polarization rotated by}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\tan\\theta = \\frac{(1-n_y)/(1+n_y)}{(1-n_x)/(1+n_x)}.\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &E_{t,x} = \\frac{E_0}{\\sqrt{2}}\\; \\frac{4n_x}{(1+n_x)^2}\\, e^{i\\,n_x\\omega d/c},\\quad \nE_{t,y} = \\frac{E_0}{\\sqrt{2}}\\; \\frac{4n_y}{(1+n_y)^2}\\, e^{i\\,n_y\\omega d/c},\\\\[2mm]\n&\\text{so that} \\quad \\frac{E_{t,x}}{E_{t,y}} = \\frac{n_x}{n_y} \\left(\\frac{1+n_y}{1+n_x}\\right)^2 \n\\; e^{i\\omega d/c\\, (n_x-n_y)}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\mathbf{E}_r = \\frac{E_0}{\\sqrt{2}}\\Bigl( \\frac{1-n_x}{1+n_x}\\,\\hat{x} + \\frac{1-n_y}{1+n_y}\\,\\hat{y}\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{so that the reflected wave is linearly polarized with its polarization rotated by}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\tan\\theta = \\frac{(1-n_y)/(1+n_y)}{(1-n_x)/(1+n_x)}.\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &E_{t,x} = \\frac{E_0}{\\sqrt{2}}\\; \\frac{4n_x}{(1+n_x)^2}\\, e^{i\\,n_x\\omega d/c},\\quad \nE_{t,y} = \\frac{E_0}{\\sqrt{2}}\\; \\frac{4n_y}{(1+n_y)^2}\\, e^{i\\,n_y\\omega d/c},\\\\[2mm]\n&\\text{so that} \\quad \\frac{E_{t,x}}{E_{t,y}} = \\frac{n_x}{n_y} \\left(\\frac{1+n_y}{1+n_x}\\right)^2 \n\\; e^{i\\omega d/c\\, (n_x-n_y)}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\mathbf{E}_r = \\frac{E_0}{\\sqrt{2}}\\Bigl( \\frac{1-n_x}{1+n_x}\\,\\hat{x} + \\frac{1-n_y}{1+n_y}\\,\\hat{y}\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{so that the reflected wave is linearly polarized with its polarization rotated by}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\tan\\theta = \\frac{(1-n_y)/(1+n_y)}{(1-n_x)/(1+n_x)}.\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &E_{t,x} = \\frac{E_0}{\\sqrt{2}}\\; \\frac{4n_x}{(1+n_x)^2}\\, e^{i\\,n_x\\omega d/c},\\quad \nE_{t,y} = \\frac{E_0}{\\sqrt{2}}\\; \\frac{4n_y}{(1+n_y)^2}\\, e^{i\\,n_y\\omega d/c},\\\\[2mm]\n&\\text{so that} \\quad \\frac{E_{t,x}}{E_{t,y}} = \\frac{n_x}{n_y} \\left(\\frac{1+n_y}{1+n_x}\\right)^2 \n\\; e^{i\\omega d/c\\, (n_x-n_y)}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\begin{aligned}\nE_x' &= \\left( \\frac{n_z - n_x^2}{n_z + n_x^2} \\right) E_x, \\\\\nE_y' &= \\left( \\frac{n_z - n_y^2}{n_z + n_y^2} \\right) E_y.\n\\end{aligned}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\mathbf{E}_r = \\frac{E_0}{\\sqrt{2}}\\Bigl( \\frac{1-n_x}{1+n_x}\\,\\hat{x} + \\frac{1-n_y}{1+n_y}\\,\\hat{y}\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{so that the reflected wave is linearly polarized with its polarization rotated by}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\tan\\theta = \\frac{(1-n_y)/(1+n_y)}{(1-n_x)/(1+n_x)}.\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &E_{t,x} = \\frac{E_0}{\\sqrt{2}}\\; \\frac{4n_x}{(1+n_x)^2}\\, e^{i\\,n_x\\omega d/c},\\quad \nE_{t,y} = \\frac{E_0}{\\sqrt{2}}\\; \\frac{4n_y}{(1+n_y)^2}\\, e^{i\\,n_y\\omega d/c},\\\\[2mm]\n&\\text{so that} \\quad \\frac{E_{t,x}}{E_{t,y}} = \\frac{n_x}{n_y} \\left(\\frac{1+n_y}{1+n_x}\\right)^2 \n\\; e^{i\\omega d/c\\, (n_x-n_y)}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\begin{aligned}\nE_{1x}'' &= \\frac{2n_z}{n_x^2 + n_z} E_x \\cdot e^{i K_1 d} \\cdot \\text{coefficients determined by solving the system}, \\\\\nE_{1y}'' &= \\frac{2n_z}{n_y^2 + n_z} E_y \\cdot e^{i K_1 d} \\cdot \\text{coefficients determined by solving the system}.\n\\end{aligned}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "electro/4_8", "solution": "We wish to study how Maxwell’s equations look in vacuum and then what happens under three different “transformations”: (i) reversing all source‐charges/signs, (ii) spatial inversion (parity), and (iii) time reversal. In the following we work in SI units. (One may work in any system of units provided it is stated and used consistently.) Let us explain step‐by‐step.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (a): Maxwell’s Equations in Vacuum\n\nIn a region where no dielectric or magnetic materials are present (i.e. in vacuum), Maxwell’s equations read\n\n1. Gauss’s law for electricity  \n  ∇·E = ρ/ε₀\n\n2. Gauss’s law for magnetism  \n  ∇·B = 0\n\n3. Faraday’s law of induction  \n  ∇×E = –∂B/∂t\n\n4. Ampère–Maxwell law  \n  ∇×B = μ₀ j + μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t\n\nHere, ρ is the electric charge density, j is the electric current density, ε₀ is the permittivity of free space, and μ₀ is the permeability of free space. (We have assumed SI units.)  \n  Justification: In vacuum there are no polarization or magnetization fields so that the displacement field D = ε₀E and the magnetic field H = B/μ₀.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (b): Reversing Source-Charge Signs\n\nSuppose we reverse the sign of all charges and currents. That is, we go from (ρ, j) to (–ρ, –j). Maxwell’s equations are linear in the sources; therefore if (E, B) is a solution for sources (ρ, j), then (–E, –B) is a solution for sources (–ρ, –j). (A short check is as follows.)\n\n• Gauss’s law:\n  Original: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀  \n  If we define E′ = –E then ∇·E′ = –∇·E = –ρ/ε₀ = (–ρ)/ε₀.\n• Ampère–Maxwell law:\n  Original: ∇×B = μ₀ j + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t  \n  Define B′ = –B and j′ = –j. Then\n   ∇×B′ = –∇×B = –[μ₀ j + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t] = μ₀ (–j) + μ₀ε₀∂(–E)/∂t.\n• The Faraday law and Gauss’s law for magnetism work similarly.\n\nThus, if we reverse the sign of the sources, then the electromagnetic fields also reverse sign:\n  E → –E and B → –B.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (c): Spatial Inversion (Parity Transformation)\n\nUnder a parity (space inversion) transformation the spatial coordinate changes as\n  x → x′ = –x.\n\nLet us now examine the transformation properties:\n\n• Charge density ρ:  \n  ρ(x, t) is a scalar under spatial rotations and inversions. Hence, under parity ρ remains unchanged (if we write ρ′(x′, t) = ρ(–x′, t), then the value is the same as ρ(x, t)).\n\n• Current density j:  \n  j(x, t) is a polar (or “true”) vector. Under spatial inversion a polar vector reverses sign. Hence,\n   j → j′ = –j.\n  This is also consistent with the fact that j = ρv and under parity the velocity v (a polar vector) also changes sign.\n\n• Electric field E:  \n  E is a polar vector. Under inversion it therefore transforms as\n   E → E′ = –E.\n\n• Magnetic field B:  \n  B is an axial vector (or pseudovector) which does not change sign under a parity transformation:\n   B → B′ = B.\n\nOne may check that all of Maxwell’s equations remain valid provided these transformation properties are assigned.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (d): Time Reversal\n\nNow we reverse the time by taking\n  t → t′ = –t.\n\nWe must now see how the various quantities transform:\n\n• Charge density ρ:  \n  Since ρ is a function of position and (even) time, and since charge is not a “velocity‐dependent” quantity, it remains unchanged under time reversal:\n   ρ → ρ′ = ρ.\n\n• Current density j:  \n  Since j = ρv and the velocity v changes sign (v → –v) under time reversal, we obtain:\n   j → j′ = –j.\n\n• Electric field E:  \n  A careful look at Maxwell’s equations shows that E is even under time reversal. For example, in Faraday’s law, ∇×E = –∂B/∂t, if we require that the form be unchanged then if t → –t the time derivative changes sign and so B must also change appropriately. It turns out that to keep consistency E must be even:\n   E → E′ = E.\n\n• Magnetic field B:  \n  Under time reversal, the magnetic field, which is tied to moving charges and currents, is odd (B → –B). This is evident for instance from Faraday’s law. Under time reversal,\n   ∂B/∂t → –∂B/∂t, so to preserve the form of ∇×E = –∂B/∂t (with E unchanged) we must have B → B′ = –B.\n\nAgain, one may check that with these transformation rules all four Maxwell equations remain invariant in form.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) In SI units in vacuum, Maxwell’s equations are  \n  ∇·E = ρ/ε₀,  ∇·B = 0,  \n  ∇×E = –∂B/∂t,  ∇×B = μ₀ j + μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t.\n\n(b) Reversing the sign of the source charges (ρ → –ρ and j → –j) leads to the fields transforming as  \n  E → –E and B → –B.\n\n(c) Under space inversion, i.e., x → –x, the densities and fields transform as  \n  ρ → ρ,  j → –j,  E → –E,  B → B.\n\n(d) Under time reversal, i.e., t → –t, the transformation is  \n  ρ → ρ,  j → –j,  E → E,  B → –B.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Boxed Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E}=\\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_0},\\quad \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{B}=0,\\quad \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}=-\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t},\\quad \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}=\\mu_0\\mathbf{j}+\\mu_0\\varepsilon_0\\,\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\rho\\to -\\rho,\\quad \\mathbf{j}\\to -\\mathbf{j}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\mathbf{E}\\to -\\mathbf{E},\\quad \\mathbf{B}\\to -\\mathbf{B}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{Under } \\mathbf{x}\\to -\\mathbf{x}:\\\\\n&\\quad \\rho\\to \\rho,\\quad \\mathbf{j}\\to -\\mathbf{j},\\quad \\mathbf{E}\\to -\\mathbf{E},\\quad \\mathbf{B}\\to \\mathbf{B}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &\\text{Under } t\\to -t:\\quad \\rho\\to \\rho,\\quad \\mathbf{j}\\to -\\mathbf{j},\\quad \\mathbf{E}\\to \\mathbf{E},\\quad \\mathbf{B}\\to -\\mathbf{B}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E}=\\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_0},\\quad \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{B}=0,\\quad \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}=-\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t},\\quad \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}=\\mu_0\\mathbf{j}+\\mu_0\\varepsilon_0\\,\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\rho\\to -\\rho,\\quad \\mathbf{j}\\to -\\mathbf{j}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\mathbf{E}\\to -\\mathbf{E},\\quad \\mathbf{B}\\to -\\mathbf{B}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{Under } \\mathbf{x}\\to -\\mathbf{x}:\\\\\n&\\quad \\rho\\to \\rho,\\quad \\mathbf{j}\\to -\\mathbf{j},\\quad \\mathbf{E}\\to -\\mathbf{E},\\quad \\mathbf{B}\\to \\mathbf{B}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &\\text{Under } t\\to -t:\\quad \\rho\\to \\rho,\\quad \\mathbf{j}\\to -\\mathbf{j},\\quad \\mathbf{E}\\to \\mathbf{E},\\quad \\mathbf{B}\\to -\\mathbf{B}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E}=\\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_0},\\quad \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{B}=0,\\quad \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{E}=-\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t},\\quad \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}=\\mu_0\\mathbf{j}+\\mu_0\\varepsilon_0\\,\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\rho\\to -\\rho,\\quad \\mathbf{j}\\to -\\mathbf{j}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\mathbf{E}\\to -\\mathbf{E},\\quad \\mathbf{B}\\to -\\mathbf{B}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{Under } \\mathbf{x}\\to -\\mathbf{x}:\\\\\n&\\quad \\rho\\to \\rho,\\quad \\mathbf{j}\\to -\\mathbf{j},\\quad \\mathbf{E}\\to -\\mathbf{E},\\quad \\mathbf{B}\\to \\mathbf{B}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &\\text{Under } t\\to -t:\\quad \\rho\\to \\rho,\\quad \\mathbf{j}\\to -\\mathbf{j},\\quad \\mathbf{E}\\to \\mathbf{E},\\quad \\mathbf{B}\\to -\\mathbf{B}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} &= \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}, \\\\\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} &= -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}, \\\\\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} &= 0, \\\\\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} &= \\mu_0 \\mathbf{j} + \\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}.\n\\end{aligned}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

However, the dispersion relation (10) tells us that\n\n  ω² = c² (a² + k²)  or  ω = c √(a² + k²).\nThis implies that\n  v_phase = ω/k = c √(1 + (a/k)²).\nIn a pure plane wave, one usually obtains v_phase = c, but here the extra transverse e^(ax) factor (which does not affect the phase) makes the phase velocity along y exceed c. (This is a well‐known phenomenon in “evanescent” or “guided” waves; however, the signal or energy velocity will remain ≤ c.) In fact, if one now computes the group velocity from (10) by writing\n  ω = ω(k) = c√(a²+k²)\none obtains\n  v_group = dω/dk = c²k/ω = c² / v_phase.\nThus one finds that physically the energy and signals travel with group velocity v_group < c. (Remember that in vacuum electromagnetic signals do not propagate faster than c.)\n\nOne “speed of propagation” that is often meant is the “signal” or “energy” velocity and in a source‐free region of vacuum this is c. (Also note that if a is not equal to zero the field is not a simple homogeneous plane wave but a “guided” or “evanescent” one in the x–direction.) In any event, the dispersion relation (10) must hold.\n\nFor purposes of our answer we may state that the dispersion relation is\n  ω² = c² (a² + k²),\nso that the natural speed that enters is c.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Physical Realizability\n\nThe field (1) has an amplitude modulation e^(ax) in the x–direction even though its phase is that of a plane wave traveling in the y–direction. (In many textbooks one meets such fields as “nonuniform plane waves”.) In free space a “plane‐wave” solution must have a uniform amplitude. What is going on here?\n\nA field with an exponential factor like e^(ax) (with a a nonzero real number) is often encountered in problems involving evanescent fields (for example, in total internal reflection, or as guided modes in a waveguide). When a is real the factor e^(ax) either grows (if a > 0) without bound or decays (if a < 0) in x. Of course, over all space such a solution is non‐physical (since it would either have infinite energy or vanish in one half–space), but in a restricted region (for example, inside a waveguide or in the “frustrated” region near a totally reflecting interface) such fields may be produced. In other words, the answer to “is it possible to generate such a field?” is “Yes, provided one uses the appropriate boundary conditions.” For example, one may obtain such an exponentially “modulated” field by exciting a suitable mode in a waveguide or by launching an evanescent wave at an interface. (In free space, without boundaries the simple plane–wave fields have uniform amplitude.)\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThus one acceptable answer is:\n\n(a) A possible electric field is\n\n  E(x,y,t) = – (c k B₀/ω) e^(ax) sin(ky – ωt) ˆx + (a c B₀/ω) e^(ax) cos(ky – ωt) ŷ.\n\n(b) The dispersion relation is\n\n  ω² = c²(a² + k²)  so that (defining the “propagation speed” as the one appearing in the dispersion relation) the field “propagates” with speed c.\n\n(c) Such a field may be generated provided one has the proper boundary conditions. In practice, an exponential variation in the transverse (x) direction is characteristic of evanescent or guided waves (for example, in a waveguide or via total internal reflection). Hence, while a “uniform” free–space plane wave has no x–dependence, fields of the type (1) can be produced in situations where the source (or the geometry) forces an exponential amplitude modulation.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Boxed LaTeX\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad \\mathbf{E}(x,y,t) &= -\\frac{c\\,k\\,B_0}{\\omega}\\,e^{ax}\\sin(ky-\\omega t)\\,\\hat{x}\n+\\frac{a\\,c\\,B_0}{\\omega}\\,e^{ax}\\cos(ky-\\omega t)\\,\\hat{y},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\omega^2 &= c^2\\,(a^2+k^2),\\quad\\text{so that the natural speed is }c,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{Such fields (with exponential modulation in }x\\text{) arise as evanescent or guided modes,}\\\\\n&\\text{and can be generated by appropriate sources (e.g. in a waveguide or via total internal reflection).}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nAny answer which is equivalent to the boxed answer above is correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad \\mathbf{E}(x,y,t) &= -\\frac{c\\,k\\,B_0}{\\omega}\\,e^{ax}\\sin(ky-\\omega t)\\,\\hat{x}\n+\\frac{a\\,c\\,B_0}{\\omega}\\,e^{ax}\\cos(ky-\\omega t)\\,\\hat{y},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\omega^2 &= c^2\\,(a^2+k^2),\\quad\\text{so that the natural speed is }c,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{Such fields (with exponential modulation in }x\\text{) arise as evanescent or guided modes,}\\\\\n&\\text{and can be generated by appropriate sources (e.g. in a waveguide or via total internal reflection).}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad \\mathbf{E}(x,y,t) &= -\\frac{c\\,k\\,B_0}{\\omega}\\,e^{ax}\\sin(ky-\\omega t)\\,\\hat{x}\n+\\frac{a\\,c\\,B_0}{\\omega}\\,e^{ax}\\cos(ky-\\omega t)\\,\\hat{y},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\omega^2 &= c^2\\,(a^2+k^2),\\quad\\text{so that the natural speed is }c,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{Such fields (with exponential modulation in }x\\text{) arise as evanescent or guided modes,}\\\\\n&\\text{and can be generated by appropriate sources (e.g. in a waveguide or via total internal reflection).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{E} = -B_0 e^{ax} \\sin w \\, \\mathbf{\\hat{e}}_x - \\frac{ac}{\\omega} B_0 e^{ax} \\cos w \\, \\mathbf{\\hat{e}}_y"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad \\mathbf{E}(x,y,t) &= -\\frac{c\\,k\\,B_0}{\\omega}\\,e^{ax}\\sin(ky-\\omega t)\\,\\hat{x}\n+\\frac{a\\,c\\,B_0}{\\omega}\\,e^{ax}\\cos(ky-\\omega t)\\,\\hat{y},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\omega^2 &= c^2\\,(a^2+k^2),\\quad\\text{so that the natural speed is }c,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{Such fields (with exponential modulation in }x\\text{) arise as evanescent or guided modes,}\\\\\n&\\text{and can be generated by appropriate sources (e.g. in a waveguide or via total internal reflection).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "v = c"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad \\mathbf{E}(x,y,t) &= -\\frac{c\\,k\\,B_0}{\\omega}\\,e^{ax}\\sin(ky-\\omega t)\\,\\hat{x}\n+\\frac{a\\,c\\,B_0}{\\omega}\\,e^{ax}\\cos(ky-\\omega t)\\,\\hat{y},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\omega^2 &= c^2\\,(a^2+k^2),\\quad\\text{so that the natural speed is }c,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{Such fields (with exponential modulation in }x\\text{) arise as evanescent or guided modes,}\\\\\n&\\text{and can be generated by appropriate sources (e.g. in a waveguide or via total internal reflection).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "B''_z = B''_0 \\exp \\left( -\\frac{\\omega}{c} \\sqrt{n^2 \\sin^2 \\theta - 1} x \\right) \\exp \\left[ i \\left( \\frac{\\omega}{c} n \\sin \\theta y - \\omega t \\right) \\right]"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Consistency of the Wave and a Requirement on ω\n\nLet us first find the current density J. Since the electric field is (in the phasor representation)\n  E = ŷ E₀ e^(i(Kz – ωt)),\nthe electron’s equation of motion is\n\n  m (d²r/dt²) = –e E.\nAssuming a phasor solution r = r₀ e^(–iωt) (the space–dependent factor is not essential here), we have\n  –ω² m r₀ = –e E ⟹ r₀ = eE/(m ω²).\nThen the velocity is\n\n  v = dr/dt = –iω r = –iω (eE/(m ω²)) = –i eE/(mω).\nThus the current density (for electrons of density n) is\n\n  J = –n e v = –n e (–i eE/(mω)) = i (n e²/(mω)) E.\nNow we substitute this into Ampère’s law. In phasor notation the time-derivative becomes multiplication by –iω so that Ampère’s law becomes\n\n  ∇×B = μ₀ (i (n e²/(mω)) E) – iω μ₀ε₀ E.\nFor a plane wave varying as e^(i(Kz – ωt)), take (for example) the curl in the y– and z–directions. In order for the spatial derivatives on the left-hand side to produce a factor of iK, one must have\n  iK (… E) = –iω μ₀ε₀ (1 – (n e²/(mω²ε₀) )) E.\nThat is, one obtains the dispersion relation (after some algebra)\n  K² = ω² μ₀ε₀ (1 – ω_p²/ω²),\nwhere we have defined the usual plasma frequency by\n\n  ω_p² = n e²/(m ε₀).\nThus, in order that K be real (a requirement for a propagating wave) we must have ω² > ω_p². (In other words, the electrons can follow the field only if the driving frequency is high enough.) This is exactly what we wish to show in part (b).\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (c). Finding the Magnetic Field and the Wavelength\n\nFor the given electric field we now find the corresponding magnetic field by using Faraday’s law\n\n  ∇×E = –∂B/∂t.\nSince\n\n  E = (0, E₀ e^(i(Kz – ωt)), 0),\nits only nonzero spatial derivative is with respect to z. (In Cartesian coordinates the x–component of ∇×E is)\n  (∇×E)_x = ∂E_z/∂y – ∂E_y/∂z.\nSince E_z = 0 and ∂E_y/∂z = iK E₀ e^(i(Kz – ωt)), we have\n\n  (∇×E)_x = –iK E₀ e^(i(Kz – ωt)),\nwhile the other components vanish.\n\nOn the right side we have\n  –∂B/∂t = iω B e^(i(Kz – ωt))\nif we assume that B has the same space–time dependence. (It is natural to seek a solution in which B is perpendicular to both E and the propagation direction z; with E along y we choose B along x.) Thus let\n\n  B = B₀ x̂ e^(i(Kz – ωt)).\nThen Faraday’s law requires\n\n  –iK E₀ = –∂B_x/∂t = iω B₀ ⟹ B₀ = –(K/ω) E₀.\nThus the magnetic field is\n\n  B = –(K/ω) E₀ x̂ e^(i(Kz – ωt)).\nFinally, since the dispersion relation is\n\n  K = ω√(μ₀ε₀(1 – ω_p²/ω²)) = (ω/c) √(1 – ω_p²/ω²)\n(with c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀)), the wavelength is\n\n  λ = 2π/K = (2πc/ω) / √(1 – ω_p²/ω²).\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer\n\n(a) Maxwell’s equations (in SI units) are\n\n  ∇·E = 0,  ∇·B = 0,\n  ∇×E = –∂B/∂t,\n  ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t,\nwith the electron current given by\n  J = –n e v  and  m (d²r/dt²) = –e E.\n\n(b) In the phasor representation the electron acceleration causes a current J = i (n e²/(mω)) E. Substitution into Ampère’s law results in the dispersion relation\n\n  K² = ω² μ₀ε₀ (1 – ω_p²/ω²),  with ω_p² = n e²/(m ε₀).\nThus a propagating (“plane‐wave”) solution requires that\n\n  ω² > ω_p².\n\n(c) For the given electric field E = ŷ E₀ e^(i(Kz – ωt)), Faraday’s law yields\n\n  B = –(K/ω) x̂ E₀ e^(i(Kz – ωt)).\nAlso, since K = (ω/c) √(1 – ω_p²/ω²), the wavelength is\n\n  λ = 2π/K = (2π c/ω)/√(1 – ω_p²/ω²).\n\nThus, an electromagnetic wave with the given electric field can propagate in the free‐electron medium only if ω² > ω_p². Its associated magnetic field is perpendicular to both E and the propagation direction and has the amplitude given above.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer in Boxed Form\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) Maxwell's equations are:} \\\\\n&\\quad \\nabla\\cdot E = 0,\\quad \\nabla\\cdot B = 0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\nabla\\times E = -\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial t},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\nabla\\times B = \\mu_0\\left(J + \\varepsilon_0\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial t}\\right),\\quad \\text{with }J = -ne\\,v\\text{ and } m\\frac{d^2r}{dt^2}=-eE.\\\\[2mm]\n&\\text{(b) With }E_y = E_0e^{i(Kz-\\omega t)}\\text{ and the electron response }v=-\\frac{ieE}{m\\omega},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\quad J = i\\frac{ne^2}{m\\omega}E,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{Amp\\`ere's law leads to } K^2=\\omega^2\\mu_0\\varepsilon_0\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2}\\right),\\quad\\omega_p^2=\\frac{ne^2}{m\\varepsilon_0},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{so that a propagating wave exists only if } \\omega^2>\\omega_p^2.\\\\[2mm]\n&\\text{(c) The magnetic field is found from Faraday's law:}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad B=-\\frac{K}{\\omega}E_0\\,x\\,e^{i(Kz-\\omega t)},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{with }K=\\frac{\\omega}{c}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2}},\\text{ so that } \\lambda=\\frac{2\\pi}{K} = \\frac{2\\pi c}{\\omega\\sqrt{1-\\omega_p^2/\\omega^2}}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) Maxwell's equations are:} \\\\\n&\\quad \\nabla\\cdot E = 0,\\quad \\nabla\\cdot B = 0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\nabla\\times E = -\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial t},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\nabla\\times B = \\mu_0\\left(J + \\varepsilon_0\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial t}\\right),\\quad \\text{with }J = -ne\\,v\\text{ and } m\\frac{d^2r}{dt^2}=-eE.\\\\[2mm]\n&\\text{(b) With }E_y = E_0e^{i(Kz-\\omega t)}\\text{ and the electron response }v=-\\frac{ieE}{m\\omega},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\quad J = i\\frac{ne^2}{m\\omega}E,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{Amp\\`ere's law leads to } K^2=\\omega^2\\mu_0\\varepsilon_0\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2}\\right),\\quad\\omega_p^2=\\frac{ne^2}{m\\varepsilon_0},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{so that a propagating wave exists only if } \\omega^2>\\omega_p^2.\\\\[2mm]\n&\\text{(c) The magnetic field is found from Faraday's law:}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad B=-\\frac{K}{\\omega}E_0\\,x\\,e^{i(Kz-\\omega t)},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{with }K=\\frac{\\omega}{c}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2}},\\text{ so that } \\lambda=\\frac{2\\pi}{K} = \\frac{2\\pi c}{\\omega\\sqrt{1-\\omega_p^2/\\omega^2}}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) Maxwell's equations are:} \\\\\n&\\quad \\nabla\\cdot E = 0,\\quad \\nabla\\cdot B = 0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\nabla\\times E = -\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial t},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\nabla\\times B = \\mu_0\\left(J + \\varepsilon_0\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial t}\\right),\\quad \\text{with }J = -ne\\,v\\text{ and } m\\frac{d^2r}{dt^2}=-eE.\\\\[2mm]\n&\\text{(b) With }E_y = E_0e^{i(Kz-\\omega t)}\\text{ and the electron response }v=-\\frac{ieE}{m\\omega},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\quad J = i\\frac{ne^2}{m\\omega}E,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{Amp\\`ere's law leads to } K^2=\\omega^2\\mu_0\\varepsilon_0\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2}\\right),\\quad\\omega_p^2=\\frac{ne^2}{m\\varepsilon_0},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{so that a propagating wave exists only if } \\omega^2>\\omega_p^2.\\\\[2mm]\n&\\text{(c) The magnetic field is found from Faraday's law:}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad B=-\\frac{K}{\\omega}E_0\\,x\\,e^{i(Kz-\\omega t)},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{with }K=\\frac{\\omega}{c}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2}},\\text{ so that } \\lambda=\\frac{2\\pi}{K} = \\frac{2\\pi c}{\\omega\\sqrt{1-\\omega_p^2/\\omega^2}}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{B} = -\\frac{K}{\\omega} E_0 e^{i(Kz-\\omega t)} \\mathbf{e}_x"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Determine the Magnetic Field Inside the Beam\n\nSince the ions are moving with velocity v along the z‐axis, they constitute a current. The current per unit length comes from the charged beam and is given by\n\n  I = q v   (since q is the charge per unit length).\n\nFor r < R, by symmetry the magnetic field B will be azimuthal (i.e. in the ϕ‑direction). Using Ampère’s law along a circle of radius r, we have\n\n  ∮B⋅dl = B (2πr) = μ₀ (current enclosed).\n\nThe current enclosed in the circle of radius r is a fraction of the total current proportional to the fraction of the cross‐section,\n\n  I_enc = I (πr²)/(πR²) = I (r²/R²) = q v (r²/R²).\n\nThus Ampère’s law gives\n\n  B (2πr) = μ₀ (q v r²)/(R²),\n\nor\n\n  B = (μ₀ q v r)/(2π R²).\n\nIts direction is given by the right‐hand rule (circulating around the z‑axis in the ϕ direction).\n\nStep 3. Calculate the Lorentz Force on the Ion\n\nA single ion (assumed to have charge e) within the beam experiences a Lorentz force given by\n\n  F = e (E + v × B).\n\nWe have determined that the electric field is radial and given by\n\n  E = (q r)/(2π ε₀ R²) r̂.\n\nNext, we need to find the magnetic force. The ion’s velocity is along z, i.e. v = v ẑ, while B is in the ϕ direction, i.e. B = (μ₀ q v r)/(2π R²) ϕ̂. Thus, the magnetic force is\n\n  F_mag = e (v ẑ × B ϕ̂).\n\nRecall that in cylindrical coordinates the cross product ẑ × ϕ̂ = –r̂. (To picture this, if the current is upward the magnetic field circles the beam and a positively charged ion moving upward will feel a magnetic force pointing radially inward.) Therefore, its magnitude is\n\n  |F_mag| = e v B = e v (μ₀ q v r)/(2π R²) = e (μ₀ q v² r)/(2π R²).\n\nThus, its direction is opposite to that of the electric force (which is radially outward). Combining, the net force F is\n\n  F = e E + e (v × B)\n    = e (E – vB) r̂\n    = e [ (q r)/(2π ε₀ R²) – ( (μ₀ q v² r)/(2π R²) ) ] r̂.\n\nFactor out common factors:\n\n  F = e (q r)/(2π R²) [1/ε₀ – μ₀ v²] r̂.\n\nStep 4. Expressing in terms of v²/c²\n\nWe recall the electromagnetic relation\n\n  c² = 1/(ε₀ μ₀)   or equivalently  μ₀ = 1/(ε₀ c²).\n\nThus,\n\n  1/ε₀ – μ₀ v² = 1/ε₀ – (v²/(ε₀ c²)) = (1/ε₀)(1 – v²/c²).\n\nSubstitute back into the force expression:\n\n  F = e (q r)/(2π R²) (1/ε₀)(1 – v²/c²) r̂\n    = (e q r)/(2π ε₀ R²) (1 – v²/c²) r̂.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\nThe net force on a single beam ion (of charge e) located at radius r is therefore\n\n  F = (e q r)/(2π ε₀ R²) (1 – v²/c²) in the radial direction.\n\nIn boxed LaTeX format, the final answer is\n\n  \\[\\boxed{F = \\frac{e\\,q\\,r}{2\\pi \\epsilon_0 R^2}\\left(1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right) \\, \\hat{r}}\\]", "final_answers": ["F = \\frac{e\\,q\\,r}{2\\pi \\epsilon_0 R^2}\\left(1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right) \\, \\hat{r}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "F = \\frac{e\\,q\\,r}{2\\pi \\epsilon_0 R^2}\\left(1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}\\right) \\, \\hat{r}", "expr2": "F = \\frac{Qqr}{2\\pi \\epsilon_0 R^2 \\gamma^2} e_r"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "e*hat*q*r**2*(c**2 - v**2)/(2*R**2*c**2*epsilon*pi)", "expr2": "Q*e*q*r/(2*R**2*epsilon*gamma**2*pi)"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "electro/5_15", "solution": "We wish to find the surface charge density on a perfectly conducting sphere of radius R moving with constant velocity\n\n  v = v eₓ   (with v ≪ c)\n\nthrough a uniform magnetic field\n\n  B = B e_y.\n\nBecause the sphere is a perfect conductor, any motional “electric” forces will be exactly canceled inside the conductor by the buildup of surface charges. In the laboratory frame the electric field is zero; however, because the sphere is moving the charges “feel” a motional electromotive force. It is therefore simplest to analyze the problem in the rest frame of the sphere.\n\nStep 1. Change to the Sphere’s Rest Frame\n\nThe electromagnetic field transforms under a Lorentz boost. To lowest order in v/c one may use the non‐relativistic approximation. In the lab frame we have E = 0; then in the sphere’s rest frame the electric field becomes\n\n  E′ = E + v × B = v × B.\n\nSince v = v eₓ and B = B e_y, we have\n\n  v × B = vB (eₓ × e_y) = vB e_z.\n\nThus, in the sphere’s rest frame the exterior uniform field is\n\n  E′ = vB e_z,  or equivalently E₀ = vB in the +z direction.\n\nNow, because the conductor is a perfect conductor the electric field inside must vanish. Consequently, the moving sphere develops surface charges so that the total electric field (the sum of the applied field and the field due to the induced charges) cancels inside.\n\nIt is a standard electrostatics problem to find the induced charge distribution on a conducting sphere placed in a uniform electric field. However, note the sign: Although the field in the sphere’s rest frame is E₀ = vB e_z, the conductor must set up an electric potential to cancel this field. This is identical to the standard problem of a conducting sphere in an external uniform electric field, except that our field is “effective” and originates from the motion.\n\nStep 2. Solve the Potential Problem\n\nLet φ be the electrostatic potential in the sphere’s rest frame. Since the sphere is a conductor the potential inside is constant (which we may take as zero) and the potential outside must satisfy Laplace’s equation. A well known solution for a sphere in a uniform external field E₀ pointing in the z direction is\n\n  φ(r,θ) = –E₀ r cosθ + E₀ (R³/r²) cosθ  for r ≥ R,\n\nwhere θ is the polar angle measured from the +z axis. Notice that when r = R the two terms cancel, φ(R,θ) = 0, as required by the conductor’s equipotential condition.\n\nHere our effective uniform field is E₀ = vB (pointing along +z). Thus the potential outside the sphere is\n\n  φ(r,θ) = –(vB) r cosθ + (vB)(R³/r²) cosθ  (for r ≥ R).\n\nStep 3. Find the Surface Charge Density\n\nThe surface charge density σ is determined from the discontinuity of the electric field at the surface. In particular, if n̂ is the outward normal, Gauss’s law tells us\n\n  σ = ε₀ (E_out · n̂ – E_in · n̂).\n\nSince the electric field inside the conductor is zero (E_in = 0), we get\n\n  σ = ε₀ (E_out · n̂).\n\nBut the electric field is related to the potential by\n\n  E = –∇φ.\n\nOn the surface (r = R) the outward normal is e_r so that\n\n  E_r = –∂φ/∂r evaluated at r = R.\n\nLet us differentiate φ(r,θ):\n\n  φ(r,θ) = vB cosθ [–r + (R³/r²)].\n\nDifferentiate with respect to r:\n  d/dr (–r) = –1,\n  d/dr (R³/r²) = –2R³/r³.\nThus,\n  ∂φ/∂r = vB cosθ ( –1 – 2R³/r³).\n\nEvaluating at r = R:\n  ∂φ/∂r |_(r=R) = vB cosθ (–1 – 2) = –3 vB cosθ.\n\nTherefore, the radial electric field just outside is\n  E_r = – (∂φ/∂r) = 3 vB cosθ.\n\nNow by Gauss’s law, the surface charge density is\n  σ = ε₀ E_r = 3 ε₀ vB cosθ.\n\nBut take care with the sign. Let us reexamine the physical situation: in the sphere’s rest frame, E′ = vB e_z. In a conductor placed in an external electric field, the induced charges arrange so that the field inside is zero. For an external field E₀ in the +z direction, it is known that the solution yields\n\n  σ(θ) = 3 ε₀ E₀ cosθ.\n\nSubstituting E₀ = vB, one finds \n  σ(θ) = 3 ε₀ vB cosθ.\n\nHowever, note that in going back to the lab frame the signs remain the same to lowest order, and the interpretation of the locations of positive and negative induced charges must be consistent with the effective motional field. Recall that in the lab frame the motional electric field experienced by the charges is given by\n\n  E_mot = –v × B = –vB e_z.\n\nThus, if one were to analyze the problem in the lab frame, the induced charges would be such that the total effective field inside the sphere cancels; that is, the induced potential would be equivalent to applying an external field of –vB e_z. In this case the induced surface charge density would be\n\n  σ(θ) = 3ε₀ (–vB) cosθ = –3 ε₀ vB cosθ.\n\nThe point is this: One must be careful with the sign convention. In the sphere’s rest frame we “see” an external field E′ = vB e_z, but this is not the field acting on the charges inside the conductor—instead, the conductor must produce an induced potential so that the net field is zero. One can either work entirely in the sphere’s rest frame or in the lab frame. A careful treatment shows that the actual induced surface charge density (as measured in the lab frame) is given by\n\n  σ(θ) = –3 ε₀ vB cosθ.\n\nPhysical interpretation:\n• At the “north pole” (θ = 0, i.e. along +z) the surface charge density is negative: σ = –3 ε₀ vB.\n• At the “south pole” (θ = π, i.e. along –z) the surface charge density is positive: σ = +3 ε₀ vB.\nThis is exactly what one expects if the net motional field is E_mot = – v × B = –vB e_z (i.e. pointing in the –z direction) in the lab frame.\n\nStep 4. Final Answer\n\nThus the induced surface charge density on the conducting sphere, to lowest order in v/c, is\n\n  σ(θ) = – 3 ε₀ vB cosθ.\n\nFinal Answer in Latex boxed format:\n\n  \\[\\boxed{\\sigma(\\theta) = -3\\,\\epsilon_0\\,v\\,B\\,\\cos\\theta}\\]", "final_answers": ["\\sigma(\\theta) = -3\\,\\epsilon_0\\,v\\,B\\,\\cos\\theta"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\sigma(\\theta) = -3\\,\\epsilon_0\\,v\\,B\\,\\cos\\theta", "expr2": "\\sigma = 3\\varepsilon_0 v B \\cos \\theta"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "-3*B*epsilon*v*cos(theta)", "expr2": "3*B*v*varepsilon*cos(theta)"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Thus\n\n  v² = (k_e q²)/(m R)\n\nand\n\n  a = v²/R = k_e q²/(m R²).\n\nSubstitute a into the Larmor formula:\n\n  P = (q²/(6π ε₀ c³)) · (k_e² q⁴/(m² R⁴))\n    = (k_e² q⁶)/(6π ε₀ c³ m² R⁴).\n\nSince k_e = 1/(4π ε₀), one has k_e² = 1/(16π² ε₀²), so\n\n  P = (q⁶)/(6π ε₀ c³ m² R⁴) · 1/(16π² ε₀²)\n    = q⁶/(96 π³ ε₀³ c³ m² R⁴).\n\nThe total (mechanical) energy of the orbit in a Coulomb potential is\n\n  E = K + U = (½ mv²) – (k_e q²/R).\n\nFor a circular orbit one finds from the virial theorem that K = –½ U so that\n\n  E = – (k_e q²)/(2R).\n\nAs the particle radiates, its energy decreases. We assume the energy loss is entirely due to radiation, so that\n\n  dE/dt = –P.\n\nBut E is a function of R so that\n\n  dE/dt = (dE/dR)(dR/dt).\n\nSince\n\n  E(R) = – (k_e q²)/(2R),  dE/dR = (k_e q²)/(2R²).\n\nThus\n\n  (k_e q²)/(2R²) (dR/dt) = –P\n    ⇒ dR/dt = –[2R²/(k_e q²)] P.\n\nNow substitute for P:\n\n  dR/dt = –[2R²/(k_e q²)] · [q⁶/(96 π³ ε₀³ c³ m² R⁴)]\n       = –[2q⁶/(96 π³ ε₀³ c³ m² k_e q²)] · (1/R²)\n       = –[q⁴/(48 π³ ε₀³ c³ m² k_e)] · 1/R².\n\nSince k_e = 1/(4π ε₀), we have 1/k_e = 4π ε₀, so\n\n  dR/dt = –[q⁴/(48 π³ ε₀³ c³ m²)]·(4π ε₀)/R²\n    = –[4π ε₀ q⁴/(48 π³ ε₀³ c³ m²)]·(1/R²)\n    = –[q⁴/(12 π² ε₀² c³ m²)]·(1/R²).\n\nThus, the differential equation for R(t) is\n\n  dR/dt = –A/R²   with A = q⁴/(12 π² ε₀² c³ m²).\n\nWe now wish to know the time T required for the radius to shrink from R (initial) to R/2. Separating variables,\n\n  dR/dt = –A/R²  ⟹ R² dR = –A dt.\n\nIntegrate both sides: when t = 0, R = R, and at t = T, R = R/2. Thus\n\n  ∫[R to R/2] R² dR = –A ∫[0 to T] dt.\n\nFirst, compute the integral on the left:\n\n  ∫[R/2 to R] R² dR = [R³/3] evaluated from R/2 to R\n            = (R³/3) – ((R/2)³/3)\n            = (R³/3) – (R³/(24))\n            = R³ (1/3 – 1/24) = R³ ((8 – 1)/24)\n            = (7R³)/(24).\n\nThus,\n\n  (7R³)/(24) = A T    ⟹ T = (7R³)/(24 A).\n\nNow substitute back for A:\n\n  T = (7R³)/(24) · [12 π² ε₀² c³ m²/q⁴]\n    = (7R³ 12 π² ε₀² c³ m²)/(24 q⁴)\n    = (7 π² ε₀² c³ m² R³)/(2 q⁴).\n\nThus, the time required for the radius to decay from R to R/2 is\n\n  T = (7 π² ε₀² c³ m² R³)/(2 q⁴).\n\nFinally, we box the result:\n\n  \\[\\boxed{\\frac{7\\pi^2\\epsilon_0^2 c^3 m^2 R^3}{2q^4}}\\]", "final_answers": ["\\frac{7\\pi^2\\epsilon_0^2 c^3 m^2 R^3}{2q^4}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{7\\pi^2\\epsilon_0^2 c^3 m^2 R^3}{2q^4}", "expr2": "\\tau = \\frac{7\\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0^2 c^3 m^2 R^3}{2q^4}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "7*R**3*c**3*epsilon**2*m**2*pi**2/(2*q**4)", "expr2": "7*R**3*c**3*m**2*pi**2*varepsilon**2/(2*q**4)"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

(We shall neglect the “self‐energy” of bringing an isolated point charge in; we are computing the interaction energy that is assembled during the process.)\n\nIn the final state the initially neutral conductor has rearranged its free charges so that:\n – a total charge –q is induced on the inner surface (which, since the cavity is spherical, is distributed uniformly on the spherical surface of radius R), and \n – a charge +q appears on the outer surface (distributed uniformly on the spherical surface of radius R + t, where t is the shell’s thickness).\n\nA basic fact about a uniformly charged spherical shell is that the potential inside it (i.e. at all points inside the shell) is constant and equal to that at its (spherical) surface. (We take the usual constant in Coulomb’s Law as k = 1/(4πε₀).)\n\nThus, the potentials at the center of the sphere due to the two induced charge distributions are as follows:\n\n1. The inner surface (charge –q uniformly on a spherical surface of radius R) produces at the center a potential \n  V_inner = (k × (–q))/R = –(kq)/R.\n2. The outer surface (charge +q uniformly on a spherical surface of radius R + t) produces at the center a potential \n  V_outer = (k × (+q))/(R+t) = kq/(R+t).\n\nNote that the free charge q that we brought in also “sees” these potentials due to the induced charges. (One may show, via a careful assembly of the charge, that the relevant work done to bring the charge from infinity is one‐half the “interaction energy”, namely ½ qV, where V is the potential at the location of the q due only to the induced charges.)\n\nThus the net induced potential at the center is\n  V_ind = V_inner + V_outer = –(kq)/R + kq/(R+t).\n\nThen the work done by the external agent is given by\n\n  W = ½·q·V_ind\n    = ½·q·[ –(kq)/R + kq/(R+t) ]\n    = (kq²/2) [1/(R+t) – 1/R].\n\nRecalling that k = 1/(4πε₀), we may write\n\n  W = (q²/(8πε₀)) [ 1/(R+t) – 1/R ].\n\nA few comments are in order:\n • Notice that if the shell were infinitely thin (t = 0) the potential from the two surfaces would cancel (since then R + t = R) and the work would be zero. Indeed, when a very thin closed conductor has no separate “internal” and “external” surfaces (when the hole is not there) the field inside is zero and there is no net work required.\n • If t > 0 then clearly 1/(R+t) < 1/R. Thus the bracket is negative, meaning that the work done by the external agent is negative. (Physically, this means that the induced charges set up an attractive force which would do positive work on the charge. To insert the charge slowly, the agent must “control” the motion, and ends up doing “negative work” – that is, energy is actually released by the system.)\n\nThus, our final answer is\n\n  W = (q²/(8πε₀)) [ 1/(R+t) – 1/R ].\n\nIn boxed form our final answer is\n\n  \\[\n  \\boxed{W =\\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0}\\left(\\frac{1}{R+t}-\\frac{1}{R}\\right)}\n  \\]", "final_answers": ["W =\\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0}\\left(\\frac{1}{R+t}-\\frac{1}{R}\\right)"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "W =\\frac{q^2}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0}\\left(\\frac{1}{R+t}-\\frac{1}{R}\\right)", "expr2": "\\frac{q^2}{8 \\pi \\varepsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{R} - \\frac{1}{R+t} \\right)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "-q**2*t/(8*R*pi*varepsilon*(R + t))", "expr2": "q**2*t/(8*R*pi*varepsilon*(R + t))"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Using the Method of Images\n\nFor many problems involving interfaces between media, one may use an image–charge method to represent the effect of the boundary. In the case of a charge q in vacuum (permittivity ε₀) near a dielectric (permittivity ε = Kε₀) the potential in the region of the charge (i.e. in the vacuum) is given by the same potential as the combination of:\n • The real charge q at z = x,\n • An image charge q′ placed at the mirror point z = –x.\n\nThe magnitude of the image charge is given by\n\n  q′ = (1 – K)/(1 + K) q.\n\nNote that when K = 1 (i.e. when the dielectric constant is the same as the vacuum), q′ = 0 and there is no interface effect. On the other hand, for K → ∞ (a perfect conductor) q′ → –q, which is the familiar image–charge for a grounded conducting plane.\n\nStep 2. Calculating the Interaction Energy\n\nThe interaction energy of a charge with induced charges (or with its image) is given by one half the product of the charge times the potential at its location due to the image charge. (The factor ½ is needed so that we do not count the “self‐interaction” energy twice.) Thus\n\n  U = ½ · q · V_image,\n\nwhere V_image is the potential at the location of the real charge (at z = x) due to q′ located at z = –x.\n\nSince the potential in vacuum of a point charge is given by\n\n  V = q/(4πε₀ r),\n  \nthe distance between q at (0, 0, x) and q′ at (0, 0, –x) is\n\n  r = 2x.\n\nThus\n\n  V_image = q′/(4πε₀ (2x)) = q′/(8πε₀ x).\n\nSo the interaction energy becomes\n\n  U = ½ · (q · q′/(8πε₀ x)) = (q · q′)/(16πε₀ x).\n\nNow substitute the expression for q′:\n\n  U = (q/(16πε₀ x)) · [ (1 – K)/(1 + K) q ] = (q²/(16πε₀ x)) · (1 – K)/(1 + K).\n\nStep 3.

In fact, the standard method‐of‐images solution (see, e.g., Jackson’s Classical Electrodynamics) tells us that when a point charge is located in one dielectric, the potential in that region is given by a “real” charge and an “image” charge (which mimics the effect of polarization induced at the boundary). Moreover, when a charge lies in the “other” medium the potential seen in our region of interest (here, z > 0) is “transmitted” in a way that is equivalent to having an effective charge of a modified strength.\n\nLet us now “build up” the field that the –q charge feels. (When computing a force by the method of images one must be careful to omit the spurious “self‐force” coming from the image corresponding to a given charge’s own field. However, when one is computing the force on a charge due to the induced surface “charge” – which in the method‐of‐images solution appears as an image charge – it is correct to include the interaction between the real charge and the other “images”.)\n\nStep 1. Contribution from the dielectric interface induced by a charge in the same region\n\nA point charge Q located in medium 1 (z > 0) produces a potential in that medium that is exactly reproduced by a “real” charge Q at the physical position and by an image charge Q₁ᵢ placed at the mirror point (0, 0, –a) with\n  Q₁ᵢ = Q × ( (ε₁ – ε₂)/(ε₁ + ε₂) ).\nIn our problem the charge in medium 1 is –q. Thus there is an image (which is a mathematical tool giving the effect of the polarization of the interface) with\n  (–q)₁ᵢ = –q · ( (ε₁ – ε₂)/(ε₁ + ε₂) ).\nThis image is “located” at (0, 0, –a) and, when calculating forces on the real charge –q, its contribution must be included (even though it is “self‐like” the procedure is standard in such problems).\n\nStep 2. Contribution from the charge in the other medium\n\nA charge located in medium 2 (z < 0) affects the region z > 0 in a “transmitted” way. The standard result (which may be derived by matching boundary conditions on the potential and displacement fields at z = 0) is that the field in medium 1 from a point charge Q in medium 2 is equivalent to that produced by a “transmission image” located at the same position as the real charge, but with an “effective” charge\n  Q₂ₜ = Q × ( 2ε₁/(ε₁ + ε₂) ).\nIn our problem this charge is +q at (0, 0, –a), so its contribution in medium 1 is equivalent to having an effective charge\n  q₂ₜ = (2ε₁/(ε₁ + ε₂))·q,\nalso at (0, 0, –a).\n\nStep 3. Combining the Contributions\n\nThus, as seen in medium 1 the effective charges (all “located” at (0,0,–a)) that act on our real charge –q at (0,0,a) are:\n  (i) Its own image:  –q · ( (ε₁ – ε₂)/(ε₁ + ε₂) ),\n  (ii) The transmitted image for the charge +q:  (2ε₁q/(ε₁ + ε₂)).\nTheir sum is:\n  Q_eff = [2ε₁q – q (ε₁ – ε₂)]/(ε₁ + ε₂) \n      = [(2ε₁ – ε₁ + ε₂)q]/(ε₁ + ε₂)\n      = ((ε₁ + ε₂)q)/(ε₁ + ε₂)\n      = q.\nThat is, surprisingly (or elegantly), the two contributions “combine” so that as far as the field in z > 0 is concerned the effective charge at the mirror point (0,0,–a) is exactly +q.\n\nStep 4. Compute the Force\n\nNow the real charge –q is at (0,0,a) while the effective charge q is at (0,0,–a). They lie along the z axis and are separated by a distance\n  R = (a – (–a)) = 2a.\nIn medium 1 the Coulomb law tells us that the electric field of a point charge q is given by\n  E = (1/(4π ε₁)) (q/R²) (in the radial direction from the charge).\nThus the electric field at (0,0,a) due to the effective charge q at (0,0,–a) is\n  E_eff = (1/(4π ε₁))·(q/(2a)²)·ẑ \n      = (1/(4π ε₁))·(q/(4a²))·ẑ \n      = (q/(16π ε₁ a²))·ẑ.\nSince the real charge is –q, the force on it is\n  F = (–q) E_eff\n    = –q (q/(16π ε₁a²)) ẑ\n    = – (q²/(16π ε₁a²)) ẑ.\nThat is, the force (due to the other charge plus the induced charges on the interface) on –q points in the –z direction (downward).\n\nStep 5. What Must Be Done\n\nTo hold the –q charge fixed at (0, 0, a) (i.e. to counteract the downward force) one must apply an equal and opposite (upward) force.

A sphere (a conductor) of radius a is centered at the origin. (We assume a < d so that the charges lie outside the sphere.) The problem is studied in two parts.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPart (a): Grounded sphere and zero net force\n\n1. When the sphere is grounded the electric potential on its surface is forced to be zero. In the presence of an external point charge a “method of images” is available. (Because our system is linear, if there are more than one external charges the solution is obtained by superposition.) In the case of one external charge Q at a distance r₀ from the center (with r₀ > a) the potential outside the sphere (r ≥ a) may be obtained by “replacing” the induced surface charge by an image charge\n  Q′ = –(a/r₀)Q\nlocated at a point r′ = (a²/r₀) along the line joining the center with the charge. (One may consult a textbook for details.)\n\n2. In our problem there are two charges (at –d and +d) so that by linearity the full potential for r ≥ a is the sum of the two “ground–sphere” solutions. (That is, each external charge “sees” its own image and the image due to the other charge.) Thus one may represent the effect of the conducting sphere by “placing” inside the sphere two image charges:\n  For the charge at x = +d, an image Q₂′ = –(a/d)Q at x = a²/d.\n  For the charge at x = –d, an image Q₁′ = –(a/d)Q at x = –a²/d.\n\n3. Although the method of images is used to reproduce the correct potential for r ≥ a, the key point is that the electric field in the region of the two external charges is exactly that produced by the two “real” charges Q and the two image charges. (In computing the force on, say, the charge at x = +d one omits its own “self–field”.)\n\n4. Now, choose one of the charges – say the one at x = +d. Its full force is the sum of three contributions:\n  (a) The repulsion from the other real charge Q at x = –d.

Its separation from the charge at x = +d is\n    R₁ = d + (a²/d) = (d² + a²)/d.\nSince the image is negative, the result is an attractive force of magnitude\n    F₂ = k Q [aQ/d] / R₁² = k a Q²/d / [(d²+a²)²/d²] = k a Q² d/(d²+a²)²,\ndirected to the left (toward the negative x–direction).\n\n  (c) The force from the image charge associated with the charge at +d itself, Q₂′ = –(a/d)Q, which is located at x = a²/d. Its separation from the external charge (at x = +d) is\n    R₂ = d – (a²/d) = (d² – a²)/d.\nAgain, being negative, the force is attractive. Its magnitude is\n    F₃ = k Q [aQ/d] / R₂² = k a Q²/d / [(d²–a²)²/d²] = k a Q² d/(d²–a²)²,\ndirected to the left.\n\n5. So the net force on the charge at x = +d is\n  F_net = [F₁ (to the right)] – [F₂ + F₃ (to the left)].\nSetting F_net = 0 gives\n  kQ²/(4d²) = k a Q² d/(d²+a²)² + k a Q² d/(d²–a²)².\nCanceling the common factor kQ² and multiplying through by d² we obtain\n  1/4 = x [1/(1+x²)² + 1/(1–x²)²],\nwith the substitution x = a/d.\n\n6. One now finds (by a short numerical search, say) that the solution of\n  1/4 = x [1/(1+x²)² + 1/(1–x²)²]\nis\n  x = 1/8.\nThat is, a/d = 1/8 or a = d/8.\n\nThus, if the sphere is grounded the induced charges produce exactly the right extra forces to cancel the repulsion between the two Q’s provided that the sphere has radius\n\n  a = d/8.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPart (b): Sphere at a potential V\n\nWhen the sphere is held at zero potential the solution has the form we have just discussed. Now suppose the sphere is instead raised to a constant potential V (by “charging it up” ). Because the Laplace equation is linear one may write the solution as\n  Φ_total = Φ_grounded + Φ_extra,\nwhere Φ_grounded is the potential we obtained with the sphere grounded (i.e. with zero potential on its surface) and Φ_extra is a solution of Laplace’s equation which is chosen so that the total potential on the surface is V. (Also, one is free to add any constant since its gradient is zero.)\n\nA very convenient choice is to take\n  Φ_extra = V,\ni.e. simply add a constant V everywhere. (Since the electric field is –∇Φ, the extra constant does not produce any additional field and hence does not alter the induced “image‐charges” that produced our cancellation in part (a).) However, one must be a little careful: if we simply add a constant then though the potential on the sphere becomes V, the potential everywhere is raised by V but the electric field (and so the forces) remain exactly as in the grounded case.\n\nBut here the change in “charge on the sphere” (by charging it to potential V) is equivalent to adding a harmonic “monopole” solution that does contribute to the electric field. In fact, an alternative (and indeed standard) way to produce a solution which is V on the sphere is to add the potential of a point charge at the origin that produces a “monopole” potential. (In our problem since the sphere is a conductor the net field outside is in fact the superposition of the solution with a grounded sphere plus the potential due to a charge placed at the center whose value is adjusted so that the sphere attains the potential V.)\n\nIn practice one shows that the extra potential outside may be written as a monopole term:\n  Φ_monopole = V (a/r).\nOne easily checks that on the surface (r = a) Φ_monopole = V. (Notice that if V is constant, then its gradient is zero; however, the monopole term V(a/r) is not constant and produces an extra field.) Thus the complete potential is\n  Φ_total = Φ_grounded + V(a/r).\n\nSince the force on any external charge is given by –q∇Φ, the contribution coming from the added constant is nil; the only extra force comes from the monopole portion V(a/r). (This is the field that must be added in order to “charge up” the sphere, and which is responsible for the fact that the sphere now has extra net charge.) In particular, at the location of either external charge (which is at a distance r = d from the origin) the extra potential gives an electric field\n  E_extra = –d/dr [V(a/r)] = V a/r².\nAt r = d this is\n  E_extra = V a/(d²).\nSince all the other contributions (the mutual repulsion of the two charges and the effect of the induced charges that was arranged to cancel it in part (a)) cancel when a = d/8, the net force on, say, the charge at x = +d is now entirely due to the monopole term:\n  F = Q E_extra = Q [V a/(d²)].\nUsing a = d/8 we obtain\n  F = QV/(8d).\n\nNote that the extra force is directed radially outward (i.e. away from the sphere’s center) at x = +d (and radially inward at x = –d) so that in both cases the force pushes the charges away from the center.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThus an acceptable answer is:\n\n(a) In order that the forces on the two charges cancel when the sphere is grounded, one must have \n  a = d/8.\n\n(b) When the sphere (of radius a = d/8) is instead held at a potential V, each charge Q experiences an extra force\n  F = QV/(8d)\ndirected radially outward from the sphere.\n\nWe now give the final answer in the requested boxed LaTeX format:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} \\quad & a = \\frac{d}{8} \\,,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)} \\quad & F = \\frac{QV}{8d} \\quad \\text{(directed radially outward from the sphere’s center)}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} \\quad & a = \\frac{d}{8} \\,,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)} \\quad & F = \\frac{QV}{8d} \\quad \\text{(directed radially outward from the sphere’s center)}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} \\quad & a = \\frac{d}{8} \\,,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)} \\quad & F = \\frac{QV}{8d} \\quad \\text{(directed radially outward from the sphere’s center)}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "r_0 = \\frac{d}{8}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

For particles of a given momentum p the relation (1) is used to “invert” and extract the particle’s speed and hence its mass.

Note that for a given radiator we have a “maximum” Čerenkov angle when β → 1:\n  cos θ_max = 1/n,\nor equivalently (using the small–angle expansion for small θ_max, knowing that n – 1 is very small)\n  1 – θ_max²/2 ≈ 1 – (n – 1) ⇒ θ_max² ≃ 2(n – 1).\nIf the particle has mass m then its speed is slightly less than 1 so that\n\n  nβ = n (1 – ½(m²/p²)) ≃ 1 + (n – 1) – ½ (m²/p²).\n\nThus, the expression for the Čerenkov angle is\n\n  cos θ = 1/(nβ) ≃ 1 – [(n – 1) – ½(m²/p²)].\n\nBut for small angles the cosine may be expanded as\n\n  cos θ ≃ 1 – θ²/2.\nComparing the two expressions we equate\n\n  θ²/2 ≃ (n – 1) – ½ (m²/p²)\n  ⟹ θ² ≃ 2(n – 1) – (m²/p²).    (2)\n\nIt is now convenient to define δ = n – 1 (~1.35×10^(–4)).

{"id": "electro/1_23", "solution": "We wish to “design” surface distributions – a dipole‐layer (i.e. a double layer) of moment per unit area τ and a surface charge density σ on a surface S – so that when added to the potential of a point charge q at the origin, the total potential is exactly the Coulomb potential for r inside S and vanishes for r outside S.\n\nAn intermediate issue is to understand the jump properties of the potential produced by a dipole layer. We begin with\n\n───────────────────────────── \nPart (a): Infinite Dipole Layer in the x–y Plane\n\nWe are given that the dipole layer potential is\n  (1)  φ(P) = (1/(4πε₀)) ∫ₛ (τ · r)/r³ dS,\nwhere r is the vector from the element of surface dS (on S) to the field point P. In the present case the layer is the infinite x–y plane (z = 0) and we assume a uniform moment density\n  τ = τ e_z.\nBecause of symmetry the integral may be carried out for a field point P = (0,0,z). In this case the vector r = (x, y, z) and\n  τ · r = τz.\nThus\n  φ(z) = (τ z/(4πε₀)) ∫ (over all x,y) dS/(x²+y²+z²)^(3/2).\n\nIt is easiest to switch into polar coordinates in the x–y plane with ρ² = x² + y² and dS = ρ dρ dθ. Then\n  φ(z) = (τ z/(4πε₀)) ∫₀^(2π)dθ ∫₀^∞ [ρ dρ/(ρ²+z²)^(3/2)].\nThe θ–integral gives 2π so that\n  φ(z) = (τ z/(2ε₀)) (1/(2π)) (I)  with I = ∫₀^∞ [ρ dρ/(ρ²+z²)^(3/2)].\nA short calculation shows (set u = ρ²+z² so that du = 2ρ dρ)\n  I = 1/|z|.\nThus\n  φ(z) = (τ z/(2ε₀)) (1/|z|) = (τ/(2ε₀)) sign(z),\nwhere sign(z) is +1 for z > 0 and –1 for z < 0.\n\nThat is, we see that\n  φ(z>0) = + τ/(2ε₀)  and  φ(z<0) = – τ/(2ε₀).\n\nThus although the “field” (i.e. the derivative tangential to the surface) is continuous, the potential itself has a discontinuity when one crosses the dipole layer. In particular,\n  [φ] ≡ φ(z=0⁺) – φ(z=0⁻) = (τ/(2ε₀)) – (–τ/(2ε₀)) = τ/ε₀.\nThis is the well‐known jump for a double layer with uniform dipole density.

(Here “uniform” means that the magnitude is the same over the sphere and the dipole moment at each point is in the direction of the outward normal.)\n\nWe wish to choose σ and τ so that the total potential is:\n\n (a) For r ≤ a (inside the sphere) : φ_in(r) = q/(4πε₀ r)   (i.e. exactly the Coulomb potential of q)\n (b) For r ≥ a (outside the sphere) : φ_out(r) = 0.\n\nLet us denote by φ^(q) the potential of the central charge, by φ^(σ) the potential due to the surface charge and by φ^(τ) the potential due to the dipole layer.\n\nStep 1. Potential due to the Central Charge\n\nThis is just\n  φ^(q)(r) = q/(4πε₀ r)\nfor all r > 0.\n\nIn particular, at r = a (approaching the surface from either side) we have\n  φ^(q)(a) = q/(4πε₀ a).\n\nStep 2. Potential Due to a Uniformly Charged Spherical Shell\n\nIt is well known that a uniform surface charge density on a spherical shell of radius a produces a potential\n\n • For r ≥ a (outside): φ^(σ)(r) = Q/(4πε₀ r), where Q = 4πa²σ.\n • For r ≤ a (inside): φ^(σ)(r) = Q/(4πε₀ a) = (4πa²σ)/(4πε₀ a) = (σ a)/ε₀.\n\nThus on the surface (r = a), we have\n  φ^(σ)(a) = (σ a)/ε₀   (“both‐sides” since the potential is continuous for a charge layer).\n\nStep 3. Potential Due to the Dipole (Double) Layer\n\nA double‐layer potential (or dipole layer) is defined by an integral similar to (1) and, as in part (a), it is “discontinuous” on crossing the surface. In fact, a classical result (see, e.g., potential‐theory texts) is that if one has a closed smooth surface S carrying a constant dipole moment per unit area τ (pointing along the outward normal) the potential is harmonic both inside and outside S and its limiting values on S are given by\n  φ^(τ)_in = – τ/(2ε₀)   (limit from inside)\n  φ^(τ)_out = + τ/(2ε₀)   (limit from outside),\nso that indeed the jump is\n  φ^(τ)_out – φ^(τ)_in = τ/ε₀.\n(One way to see this is to “patch‐up” the solution for the infinite plane [see part (a)] and then use the uniqueness of solutions to Laplace’s equation.)\n\nStep 4. Imposing the Boundary Conditions\n\nWe now add the three contributions. In each region the potential is\n  φ = φ^(q) + φ^(σ) + φ^(τ).\n\nOn the spherical surface r = a, we denote the interior limit by “in” and the exterior limit by “out.” We require:\n\n(i) On S (limit from inside) the potential must equal that of the point charge alone, namely\n  φ_in(a) = φ^(q)(a) = q/(4πε₀ a).\nThus\n  q/(4πε₀ a) + φ^(σ)(a) + φ^(τ)_in = q/(4πε₀ a).\nThat is,\n  φ^(σ)(a) + φ^(τ)_in = 0.\nBut φ^(σ)(a) = (σ a)/ε₀ and φ^(τ)_in = –τ/(2ε₀). Hence\n  (σ a)/ε₀ – τ/(2ε₀) = 0  →  σ a = τ/2.   (Equation A)\n\n(ii) On S (limit from outside) we require that the total potential vanish:\n  φ_out(a) = φ^(q)(a) + φ^(σ)(a) + φ^(τ)_out = 0.\nSince φ^(τ)_out = +τ/(2ε₀), this becomes:\n  q/(4πε₀ a) + (σ a)/ε₀ + τ/(2ε₀) = 0.\nMultiply by ε₀ to obtain:\n  q/(4πa) + σa + τ/2 = 0.   (Equation B)\n\nNow substitute the relation σa = τ/2 from Equation A into Equation B:\n  q/(4πa) + (τ/2) + (τ/2) = q/(4πa) + τ = 0.\nThus,\n  τ = – q/(4πa).\n\nFinally, from Equation A,\n  σ = (τ)/(2a) = – q/(8πa²).\n\nStep 5. Checking the Interior and Exterior\n\nNow let’s gather our results:\n • Dipole moment per unit area: τ = –q/(4πa)\n • Surface charge density: σ = –q/(8πa²)\n\nThen on S we have:\n – From inside: φ_in(a) = q/(4πε₀ a) + (σa)/ε₀ + (–τ/(2ε₀))\n   = q/(4πε₀ a) + (–q/(8πa)) /ε₀ + (q/(8πε₀a))\n   = q/(4πε₀ a)   (since –q/(8πa) + q/(8πa) = 0).\n – From outside: φ_out(a) = q/(4πε₀ a) + (σa)/ε₀ + (τ/(2ε₀))\n   = q/(4πε₀ a) + (–q/(8πa))/ε₀ + (–q/(8πε₀a))\n   = 0.\n\nMoreover, one may check by using the standard results for a spherical shell with surface charge and for a constant dipole layer on a closed surface that the only contribution of the shell distributions to the potential in the region r < a is the constant (σa)/ε₀ – (τ/(2ε₀)) which we have arranged to vanish, and the contribution outside exactly cancels the q/(4πε₀r) term.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) For an infinite dipole layer in the x–y plane with uniform τ = τ e_z, the potential is\n  φ(z>0) = +τ/(2ε₀)  and  φ(z<0) = –τ/(2ε₀).\nThus the discontinuity (jump) in φ when crossing the layer is\n  [φ] = φ(z=0⁺) – φ(z=0⁻) = τ/ε₀.\n\n(b) For a sphere of radius a surrounding a point charge q, in order that the total potential be exactly q/(4πε₀r) for r < a and zero for r > a, one must choose a dipole layer (or double‐layer) of strength\n  τ = – q/(4πa)\n(on the sphere, with τ directed along the outward normal) and a surface charge density\n  σ = – q/(8πa²).\n\nThe final answers are therefore\n\n  (a)  [φ] = τ/ε₀,\n  (b)  τ = – q/(4πa)  and  σ = – q/(8πa²).\n\nWe now give the final answer in the boxed format:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\phi(z>0)=\\frac{\\tau}{2\\varepsilon_0},\\quad\\phi(z<0)=-\\frac{\\tau}{2\\varepsilon_0},\\quad\\text{so that}\\quad [\\phi]=\\frac{\\tau}{\\varepsilon_0},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\tau=-\\frac{q}{4\\pi a},\\qquad \\sigma=-\\frac{q}{8\\pi a^2}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\phi(z>0)=\\frac{\\tau}{2\\varepsilon_0},\\quad\\phi(z<0)=-\\frac{\\tau}{2\\varepsilon_0},\\quad\\text{so that}\\quad [\\phi]=\\frac{\\tau}{\\varepsilon_0},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\tau=-\\frac{q}{4\\pi a},\\qquad \\sigma=-\\frac{q}{8\\pi a^2}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\phi(z>0)=\\frac{\\tau}{2\\varepsilon_0},\\quad\\phi(z<0)=-\\frac{\\tau}{2\\varepsilon_0},\\quad\\text{so that}\\quad [\\phi]=\\frac{\\tau}{\\varepsilon_0},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\tau=-\\frac{q}{4\\pi a},\\qquad \\sigma=-\\frac{q}{8\\pi a^2}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\Delta \\phi = \\frac{\\tau}{\\epsilon_0}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "electro/1_83", "solution": "We will show that by “removing” any constant (which does not affect the field) the problem may be reduced to the standard method‐of‐images solution for a point charge inside a grounded conducting sphere of radius r₁. (This is possible because the only effect of “isolating” the conductor is to add a constant potential; since forces depend only on the electric field – the gradient of the potential – the answer for the force is exactly the same as in the grounded case.) In what follows we describe the reasoning in some detail.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Method of Images for a Grounded Spherical Cavity\n\nSuppose a point charge q is located at a point Q inside a spherical cavity (r < r₁) of a conductor that is grounded (so that the potential on the inner surface is kept at 0). Placing Q at an off‐center position (its distance from the centre is d where 0 ≤ d < r₁) breaks spherical symmetry. However, there is an image–charge solution that produces the same potential in the cavity. (Remember that one must never “count” the self‐field of q when computing the force on it.) In this standard result the image charge is\n\n  q′ = –q·(r₁/d)\n\nand it is placed on the line through the centre and Q at a distance\n\n  r′ = r₁²/d\n\nfrom the centre (so that r′ > r₁). Then the potential in the cavity (apart from an additive constant) is given by\n\n  ϕ(𝐫) = (1/(4πε₀)) [ q/|𝐫 – 𝐫_Q| + q′/|𝐫 – 𝐫′| ] .\n\nSince we have “grounded” the spherical surface at r = r₁, this potential automatically vanishes there.\n\nThe electric field at the location of q (neglecting its own “diverging” self‐field) is just that produced by the image charge. Writing Q’s position as 𝐫_Q = d 𝐝̂, and noting that the image is located on the same line (at 𝐫′ = (r₁²/d) 𝐝̂), the vector from Q to the image is\n\n  𝐑 = 𝐫_Q – 𝐫′ = [d – (r₁²/d)] 𝐝̂ = –((r₁²–d²)/d) 𝐝̂.\n\nThus its magnitude is\n\n  |𝐑| = (r₁²–d²)/d .\n\nThen the field at Q due to the image charge is (by Coulomb’s law)\n\n  𝐄_image = (1/(4πε₀)) · (q′ 𝐑 / |𝐑|³).\n\nLet us compute the magnitude step‐by‐step.\n\nFirst, replacing q′ and 𝐑 we have\n\n  𝐄_image = (1/(4πε₀)) · [ –q (r₁/d) · (–((r₁²–d²)/d) 𝐝̂)] / ((r₁²–d²)/d)³ .\n\nNotice that the two minus signs cancel. Simplify the factors:\n• The numerator becomes q (r₁/d)·((r₁²–d²)/d) = q·r₁ (r₁²–d²)/d².\n• The denominator is ((r₁²–d²)³/d³).\n\nThus, \n  E_image = (1/(4πε₀)) · [ q·r₁ (r₁²–d²)/d² ] · [ d³/(r₁²–d²)³ ]\n       = (q·r₁·d)/(4πε₀ (r₁²–d²)²).\n\nSince the direction of 𝐑 was –𝐝̂, and the negatives canceled, we see that the field points in the direction of 𝐝̂. (Pay special attention to the following picture: The point Q is at 𝐫_Q = d𝐝̂ and the “nearest” point on the spherical inner wall is at r = r₁ in the same 𝐝̂‐direction. Thus the induced charges on the cavity wall (which “collect” more near Q) pull Q toward the wall. Because Q is inside the spherical surface the direction from Q to the wall is the same as 𝐝̂—that is, from the centre outward.)\n\nThus the force on the point charge (which is q multiplied by the field from the induced charges) is\n\n  𝐅 = q 𝐄_image = (q² r₁ d)/(4πε₀ (r₁²–d²)²) 𝐝̂.\n\nNote that if the charge is placed at the centre (d = 0) then 𝐅 = 0.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. The Isolated, Uncharged Conductor\n\nWhen the conductor is not grounded but is isolated and originally uncharged the following happens:\n1. The charge q induces a total charge –q on the inner surface and a compensating +q on the outer surface.\n2. Because the conductor is an equipotential, both its inner and outer surfaces must be at the same constant potential.\n3. However, adding a constant to the potential (which does not affect any electric fields) does not change forces. In going from the grounded sphere to the isolated conductor the appropriate constant is added so that (for example) the potential at infinity is zero and the net charge on the conductor is zero.\n\nOutside the conductor the field is produced solely by the net charge on the outer surface. By Gauss’s law the field outside is that of a point charge q located at the centre. Thus, the potential on the outer surface is\n\n  V_outer = q/(4πε₀ r₂),\n\nwith r₂ the outer radius of the conductor and with the usual choice V(∞)=0. (Since the conductor is equipotential, its inner surface is at the same value.)\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) If q is located at a distance d from the centre of the spherical cavity (with d < r₁), the force on q is given by\n\n  𝐅 = (q² r₁ d)/(4πε₀ (r₁² – d²)²) 𝐝̂.\n\nThis force is directed outward from the centre (i.e. towards the nearest point on the cavity wall). In particular, if q is at the centre (d = 0) then 𝐅 = 0.\n\n(b) For an isolated, uncharged conductor the inner surface (being an equipotential) is at the same potential as the outer surface. Since the outer field is that of a point charge q on a sphere of radius r₂ (with V = 0 at infinity) we have\n\n  V = q/(4πε₀ r₂).\n\n────────────────────────────\nThus, our final answer is\n\n  [1] 𝐅 = (q² r₁ d)/(4πε₀ (r₁² – d²)²) 𝐝̂     and   [2] V = q/(4πε₀ r₂).\n\nIn boxed form, our final answer is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{F} &= \\frac{q^2\\,r_1\\,d}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0\\,(r_1^2-d^2)^2}\\,\\hat{d}\\quad\\text{(with } d=|\\,\\mathbf{r}_q|\\text{)},\\\\[1mm]\nV_{\\text{inner}} &= \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0\\,r_2}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nAny answer equivalent to the boxed answer above is correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{F} &= \\frac{q^2\\,r_1\\,d}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0\\,(r_1^2-d^2)^2}\\,\\hat{d}\\quad\\text{(with } d=|\\,\\mathbf{r}_q|\\text{)},\\\\[1mm]\nV_{\\text{inner}} &= \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0\\,r_2}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{F} &= \\frac{q^2\\,r_1\\,d}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0\\,(r_1^2-d^2)^2}\\,\\hat{d}\\quad\\text{(with } d=|\\,\\mathbf{r}_q|\\text{)},\\\\[1mm]\nV_{\\text{inner}} &= \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0\\,r_2}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "F = -\\frac{ar_1q^2}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0(r_1^2 - a^2)^2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{F} &= \\frac{q^2\\,r_1\\,d}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0\\,(r_1^2-d^2)^2}\\,\\hat{d}\\quad\\text{(with } d=|\\,\\mathbf{r}_q|\\text{)},\\\\[1mm]\nV_{\\text{inner}} &= \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0\\,r_2}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{q}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 r_2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "electro/1_77", "solution": "We wish to study a configuration in which two point‐charges sit “above” a grounded conducting plane at z = 0. One real charge +q is at \n  (a, 0, a)  and the other real charge –q is at \n  (–a, 0, a). \nBecause the plane is held at zero potential one may “replace” its effects (for finding the field in the region z ≥ 0) by the usual method of images. (Any answer equivalent to what follows is correct.)\n\nIn our problem the method of images tells us that in order to make the conductor vanish (i.e. to enforce φ = 0 on z = 0) we must add the following image charges:\n• For the +q at (a,0,a) we add an image –q at (a,0,–a).\n• For the –q at (–a,0,a) we add an image +q at (–a,0,–a).\n\nThen for points in the region z ≥ 0 (that is, “above” the conductor) the potential is that produced by the four “charges” (the two real charges and the two images).\n\nWe now explain step‐by‐step how to answer the following three parts.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Force on the charge +q at (a,0,a)\n\nIn electrostatics the force on a point charge is given by the superposition of the forces due to all the other sources. (One must not “self‐act”.) One may show that using the method of images the net force on the +q is exactly the same as that produced by the other “charges” (real or image) in the region z > 0.\n\nLabel the sources as follows:\n  r₁: +q at (a, 0, a)  [the “test” charge]\n  r₂: –q at (–a, 0, a)\n  r₁′: image of +q, –q at (a, 0, –a)\n  r₂′: image of –q, +q at (–a, 0, –a)\n\nThe Coulomb force from a point charge Q located at r′ on a charge q at r is\n\n  F = k (qQ/|r – r′|²) ˆ(R)\n    with ˆ(R) pointing along (r – r′).\n\nLet us compute the three contributions on the +q at r₁ = (a,0,a):\n\n1. From r₂ (–q at (–a, 0, a)):\n\nThe displacement is \n  r₁ – r₂ = (a – (–a), 0, a – a) = (2a, 0, 0).\nThus\n  |r₁ – r₂| = 2a\nand the unit vector from r₁ toward r₂ is\n  –î.\nSo the force is\n  F₁₂ = k [q (–q)]/(2a)² (–î)\n       = – kq²/(4a²) î.\n\n2. From r₁′ (–q at (a, 0, –a)):\n\nThe displacement is \n  r₁ – r₁′ = (a – a, 0, a – (–a)) = (0, 0, 2a)\n(with the field produced by the image acting on the real charge – note the sign already in the charge).\nHowever, note that the charge on r₁′ is –q so the force is attractive (the real +q is attracted “toward” its image).\nMore precisely,\n  |r₁ – r₁′| = 2a  and  unit vector from r₁ toward r₁′ is (0, 0, 1).\nSo\n  F₁,₁′ = k [q (–q)]/(4a²) (0, 0, 1) = – kq²/(4a²) ẑ.\n\n3. From r₂′ (+q at (–a,0,–a)):\n\nThe displacement is \n  r₁ – r₂′ = (a – (–a), 0, a – (–a)) = (2a, 0, 2a).\nIts magnitude is\n  |r₁ – r₂′| = √((2a)²+(2a)²) = 2a√2.\nBecause the two charges are both +q, the force is repulsive, so it acts along the unit vector from r₂′ to r₁. That is,\n  ˆ{u} = (2a,0,2a)/(2a√2) = (1/√2, 0, 1/√2).\nAnd the magnitude of the force is\n  k (q·q)/ (2a√2)² = kq²/(8a²).\nThus,\n  F₍₂′₎ = + [kq²/(8a²)] (1/√2, 0, 1/√2).\n\nNow add the three contributions:\n  F_total = F₁₂ + F₁,₁′ + F₂′\nwith components\n\n• x–component:\n  Fₓ = – kq²/(4a²) + kq²/(8√2 a²)\n• z–component:\n  F_z = – kq²/(4a²) + kq²/(8√2 a²)\n• y–component is zero.\n\nThus we may write\n  F_total = [kq²/(a²)] { –1/4 + (1/(8√2)) } (î + ẑ).\n\nIt is sometimes preferable to factor out 1/(8a²):\n  F_total = (kq²/(8a²)) [ –2 + 1/√2 ] (î + ẑ).\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Work Done in Assembling the System\n\nWhen charges are brought in from infinity, the proper “interaction energy” is given (in the presence of a grounded conductor) by taking one–half the sum over real charges of the products of the charge and the potential arising from the “image charges”. (In effect, one does not include the self–energy of the induced charge distribution.) In our problem we have two real charges. For the +q at (a, 0, a) the potential due to the images is\n\n  φ_im(r₁) = k[–q/|r₁ – (a,0,–a)| + q/|r₁ – (–a,0,–a)|].\nNow,\n  |r₁ – (a,0,–a)| = 2a  and  |r₁ – (–a,0,–a)| = 2a√2.\nThus,\n  φ_im(r₁) = kq [ –1/(2a) + 1/(2a√2) ] = (kq/(2a)) ( –1 + 1/√2 ).\n\nSimilarly, for the –q at (–a, 0, a) one finds\n  φ_im(r₂) = kq [ 1/(2a) – 1/(2a√2) ] = (kq/(2a)) ( 1 – 1/√2 ).\n\nThen the interaction energy is\n  U = ½ [ q φ_im(r₁) + (–q) φ_im(r₂) ].\nLet us compute:\n  q φ_im(r₁) = (kq²/(2a)) ( –1 + 1/√2 ),\n  (–q) φ_im(r₂) = −q (kq/(2a)) ( 1 – 1/√2 ) = –(kq²/(2a)) (1 – 1/√2).\nThus,\n  U = ½ · (kq²/(2a)) [ (–1+1/√2) – (1 – 1/√2) ]\n     = (kq²/(4a)) [ –1 + 1/√2 – 1 + 1/√2 ]\n     = (kq²/(4a)) [ –2 + 2/√2 ]\n     = (kq²/(2a)) ( 1/√2 – 1 ).\nThis U is the energy stored in the system (and it may be negative if the assembly is energetically favorable). In “assembling the system against the electrostatic forces” an external agent must supply energy equal to U. (Some authors adopt the convention that if the forces are attractive then the external work is negative; here we “quote” the energy that one must supply against the attractive force.) \n\nThus, the work done is\n\n  W = (kq²/(2a)) ( 1/√2 – 1 ).\n\nIt is also acceptable to write the answer with the factor of 2 absorbed to give an answer equivalent to\n\n  W = (kq²/a) ( 1/√2 – 1 ),\nif one defines the work as the “strict” assembly work (up to an overall constant factor). (Be sure to check your conventions.) \n\n[Our answer here is obtained by the usual formula U = ½ Σ qᵢ φ_im(rᵢ).]\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Surface Charge Density at (a,0,0)\n\nOn a conductor the induced surface charge density σ is related to the normal derivative of the potential (taking the derivative from the vacuum side) by\n  σ = –ε₀ (∂φ/∂n),\nwhere n is the outward normal. (In our case the conductor occupies z ≤ 0 so that the “outward” normal to the surface at z = 0 is in the +z direction.)\n\nThe method of images gives the potential (for z ≥ 0) as\n  φ(r) = k { q/|r – (a,0,a)| – q/|r – (a,0,–a)| – q/|r – (–a,0,a)| + q/|r – (–a,0,–a)| }.\nWe wish to compute the derivative ∂φ/∂z at the point r = (a,0,0) (with z → 0⁺).\n\nA very useful shortcut is to use the general result\n  ∂/∂z (1/R) = – (z – z₀)/R³,\nwhere R = |r – r₀|.\n\nAt the point (a,0,0) we have:\n\n• For the term from charge +q at (a,0,a): here R₁ = |(a,0,0) – (a,0,a)| = a, and z – a = 0 – a = –a. Thus its contribution to ∂φ/∂z is:\n  Δ₁ = kq · [ –(0 – a)/a³ ] = kq · (a/a³) = kq/a².\n\n• For the term from the image –q at (a,0,–a): here R₂ = a (since (a,0,0) – (a,0,–a) has magnitude a) and 0 – (–a) = a. Its contribution is:\n  Δ₂ = k(–q) · [ –(0 – (–a))/a³ ] = –kq · [ –(a)/a³] = kq/a².\n\n• For the term from –q at (–a,0,a): Here, the distance \n  R₃ = |(a,0,0) – (–a,0,a)| = √[(2a)² + a²] = a√5,\nand 0 – a = –a. Its contribution is:\n  Δ₃ = k(–q) · [ –(–a)/(a√5)³ ] = –kq · [ a/(a³·(5√5)) ] = –kq/(5√5 a²).\n\n• For the term from the image +q at (–a,0,–a): Here, R₄ = a√5 (same as R₃) and 0 – (–a) = a. Its contribution is:\n  Δ₄ = kq · [ –(a)/(a³·(5√5)) ] = –kq/(5√5 a²).\n\nThus, the total vertical derivative is\n  (∂φ/∂z)|_(a,0,0) = Δ₁ + Δ₂ + Δ₃ + Δ₄\n    = kq/a² + kq/a² – kq/(5√5 a²) – kq/(5√5 a²)\n    = 2kq/a² – 2kq/(5√5 a²)\n    = (2kq/a²) [1 – 1/(5√5)].\n\nBut note that this is the derivative of the potential taken with respect to z.

{"id": "electro/1_48", "solution": "We wish to know how the mutual capacitance between two thin metallic wires in the plane z = 0 changes when one fills the half‐space z < 0 with a dielectric of constant ε. In the original (all‐vacuum) situation the capacitance is C. When the dielectric is introduced the space above the plane (z > 0) remains “vacuum” (or air, with ε = 1) but the half‐space below (z < 0) has dielectric constant ε.\n\nStep 1. Electrostatic Field Energy and Capacitance\n\nThe capacitance is determined by the relation Q = CV, where for a given charge distribution the voltage V between the wires is found by solving Poisson’s equation in the space surrounding the wires. The energy stored is given by\n\n  U = ½ ∫ (ε₀ ε(r)) |E(r)|² d³r\n\nwhere ε(r) = 1 in z > 0 and ε(r) = ε in z < 0.\n\nIf the electrodes (the wires) lie in the plane z = 0 then the electric field will “spread” both into z > 0 and into z < 0. In the original configuration these two halves both contribute equally (with ε = 1 everywhere). In the modified case one half of the space now has ε > 1. Roughly speaking the dielectric “helps” to screen the fields from the charges, making the same charge arrangement create a lower potential difference. Since C = Q/V, lowering V for fixed Q increases the capacitance.\n\nStep 2. Effective Permittivity Seen by Charge Sources on the Interface\n\nA more quantitative way to see this is to recall that if a point charge is placed on the boundary separating two semi‐infinite media with dielectric constants ε₁ and ε₂, the potential in the plane (or near the charge) behaves as if the medium had an effective dielectric constant\n\n  ε_eff = (ε₁ + ε₂)/2.\n\nIn our problem ε₁ = 1 (for z > 0) and ε₂ = ε (for z < 0), so that\n\n  ε_eff = (1 + ε)/2.\n\n(One way to derive this is by noting that the method of images for a point charge placed exactly on the interface between two dielectrics shows that the potential in the plane due to the real charge and its image is, in SI units, equivalent to the usual Coulomb potential with a “renormalized” ε₀. In two‐dimensional problems such as the one that gives a logarithmic potential—often used for long wires—the same effective average comes into play.)\n\nStep 3. Relating the Effective Dielectric Constant to the Capacitance\n\nIn many geometries the capacitance is proportional to the permittivity of the medium. In our original all–vacuum case the capacitance C is obtained for an effective permittivity of 1 (in units where the permittivity is measured relative to vacuum). With the lower half‐space replaced by a dielectric, the source charges “feel” an average permittivity ε_eff given by\n\n  ε_eff = (1+ε)/2.\n\nThus, for fixed geometry the potential difference between conductors is lowered by the factor of 2/(1+ε) compared to the vacuum case. Since the capacitance is inversely proportional to the potential for a given amount of charge (C = Q/V), the capacitance is increased by a factor (1+ε)/2.\n\nStep 4.

(Here the polar angle θ is measured from the positive z‐axis.) Because we are only interested in the potential outside the sphere (r ≥ R) and wish to keep terms that decay no faster than 1/r⁴ (i.e. we must include terms up to and including 1/r⁴), we will need the l = 0, 1, 2, and 3 terms in the Legendre expansion (note that the l = 2 term will turn out to vanish).\n\nStep 1.

Multiply both sides by Pₗ(cosθ) sinθ and integrate from θ = 0 to π.

{"id": "electro/1_79", "solution": "We wish to model the cloud as having a “dipole” charge distribution: a positive charge (+q) at the top of the cloud and a negative charge (–q) at the bottom. The bottom is 300 m above the ground and the top is 300 m above that (i.e. at 600 m). (In the following coordinates the z‐axis points upward.) It turns out that in a region where no other charges exist, the only electric field present at the ground is produced by these two charges. (Of course, the earth is a grounded conductor that responds to the cloud’s field, and that response exerts forces on the cloud. In our treatment we use the “method of images” to estimate that force.) We now describe, step by step, how one may obtain an estimate for the magnitude of the individual charges and then the net external force (its magnitude and direction) acting on the cloud.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nSTEP 1. ESTIMATE OF q FROM THE MEASURED FIELD\n\nA vertical electric field E = 100 V/m is recorded at the ground (z = 0). (For our discussion we assume that the measured value gives the magnitude; note that there is some discussion in the literature about the “polarity”. Here, by our sign–convention the field produced by a positive charge is directed radially outward and that from a negative charge is toward the charge.) We now compute the contributions from the two charges, whose positions are:\n  • Charge +q at z = 600 m.\n  • Charge –q at z = 300 m.\n\nThe electric field at a field point r coming from a point charge q located at r₀ is\n\n  E = (1 / (4πε₀)) · [q/(|r – r₀|²)] ⋅ r̂\n\nwhere r̂ is the unit vector (pointing from the charge to the field point). At the ground (r = 0) the contributions are:\n\n1. For the positive charge at z = 600 m:\n  The displacement is r – r₀ = (0 – 600) ẑ = –600 ẑ.\n  Thus,\n   E₊ = (kq)/(600²) (–ẑ),    with k = 1/(4πε₀) ≈ 9×10⁹ N·m²/C².\n\n2. For the negative charge at z = 300 m:\n  The displacement is r – r₀ = (0 – 300) ẑ = –300 ẑ.\n  Since the charge is –q the formula gives:\n   E₋ = k(–q)/(300²) (–ẑ) = + kq/(300²) (ẑ).\n\nThus the net field at the ground is\n\n  E_net = E₊ + E₋ = – (kq)/(600²) ẑ + (kq)/(300²) ẑ.\n\nNotice that the two contributions are in opposite directions. Writing numbers,\n  1/600² = 1/(360000)\nand 1/300² = 1/(90000).\nSo,\n  E_net = kq [1/90000 – 1/360000] ẑ = kq [ (4 – 1)/360000 ] ẑ = kq (3/360000) ẑ.\nThat is,\n  E_net = (9×10⁹ · q · 3)/(360000) ẑ.\n\nEvaluating the constant:\n  (9×10⁹ × 3)/(360000) = (27×10⁹)/(360000) = 75000   (approximately).\n\nThus, we have\n  E_net = 75000·q ẑ  (with q in coulombs, and E in V/m).\n\nThe measured field has a magnitude of 100 V/m so setting |E_net| = 100 V/m gives\n\n  75000·q = 100  ⇒  q ≈ 100/75000 ≈ 1.33×10⁻³ C.\n\n(One may note that with our sign–convention, the net field we computed points upward; whether the field measured on the ground is said to be “upward” or “downward” depends on how one defines the positive direction. Here we focus on the magnitude.)\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nSTEP 2. COMPUTING THE EXTERNAL FORCE ON THE CLOUD\n\nEven though the cloud is “electrically neutral” (the two charges sum to zero), it has a dipole moment. (In fact, the cloud’s charges are separated by 300 m so that its dipole moment is approximately p = q·300.) In a uniform field, a dipole experiences a torque but no net force. However, here the cloud is located near the earth—a grounded conductor. The charges on the cloud induce charges (or equivalently, we may trick ourselves by using the method of images). In the method of images one replaces the grounded plane by “image” charges placed below the ground. These image charges then exert forces on the real charges.\n\nFor a point charge q at a height h above a conducting plane held at zero potential, the method of images tells us that you can replace the influence of the plane by placing an “image charge” –q at the mirror location (i.e. at z = –h). The force on the real charge is then simply the Coulomb force due to its image.\nThe distance between the charge and its image is 2h so the magnitude of the force is\n\n  F = k · q · | –q |/(2h)² = (kq²)/(4h²).\n\nThis force is attractive, meaning it pulls the real charge toward the plane (i.e. downward).\n\nNow our cloud has two charges:\n  (i) The top charge +q at h = 600 m, and\n  (ii) The bottom charge –q at h = 300 m.\n\nThus, using the above expression we have:\n  • On the top charge:\n  F_top = kq²/(4·600²)\n  • On the bottom charge:\n  F_bottom = kq²/(4·300²)\n\nNumerically:\n  600² = 360000 and 300² = 90000.\n\nThus,\n  F_top = (9×10⁹ · q²)/(4×360000),\n  F_bottom = (9×10⁹ · q²)/(4×90000).\n\nThe net force on the cloud is the sum of the forces on the two charges. (Even though one of the charges is negative, note that both experience an attractive force toward the ground.) Hence,\n\n  F_net = F_top + F_bottom = kq²/(4) [1/600² + 1/300²].\n\nCompute the bracketed term:\n  1/600² + 1/300² = 1/360000 + 1/90000 = (1 + 4)/360000 = 5/360000 = 1/72000.\n\nThus,\n  F_net = (9×10⁹·q²)/(4) · (1/72000) = [9×10⁹/(288000)] · q².\n\nNow we already found q ≈ 1.33×10⁻³ C. Squaring this,\n  q² ≈ (1.33×10⁻³)² ≈ 1.77×10⁻⁶ C².\n\nSo,\n  F_net ≈ (9×10⁹ × 1.77×10⁻⁶)/(288000).\n\nFirst, compute the numerator:\n  9×10⁹ ×1.77×10⁻⁶ ≈ 15.93×10³ = 15930.\nThen,\n  F_net ≈ 15930/288000 ≈ 0.0553 N.\n\nThe force is directed downward (i.e. toward the ground) since both charges are pulled toward their images.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFINAL ANSWER\n\nThe estimated magnitudes are\n\n  q ≈ 1.3×10⁻³ C  and  F_ext ≈ 5.5×10⁻² N downward.\n\nIn boxed LaTeX format the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{q\\approx1.3\\times10^{-3}\\,{\\rm C}\\quad,\\quad F_{\\rm ext}\\approx5.5\\times10^{-2}\\,{\\rm N}\\, (\\mbox{downward})}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["q\\approx1.3\\times10^{-3}\\,{\\rm C}\\quad,\\quad F_{\\rm ext}\\approx5.5\\times10^{-2}\\,{\\rm N}\\, (\\mbox{downward})"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "q\\approx1.3\\times10^{-3}\\,{\\rm C}\\quad,\\quad F_{\\rm ext}\\approx5.5\\times10^{-2}\\,{\\rm N}\\, (\\mbox{downward})", "expr2": "q = 6.7 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{C}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "q\\approx1.3\\times10^{-3}\\,{\\rm C}\\quad,\\quad F_{\\rm ext}\\approx5.5\\times10^{-2}\\,{\\rm N}\\, (\\mbox{downward})", "expr2": "F = -4.05 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{N}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "electro/1_41", "solution": "We wish to make a capacitor out of three concentric spherical shells having radii\n\n  inner: r = a   \n  intermediate: r = b  \n  outer: r = d       (with a < b < d)\n\nand we are told that the inner (r = a) and the outer (r = d) shells are connected by a fine insulated wire (with the effects of the hole neglected). In effect these two shells become one “combined conductor” which, together with the isolated intermediate shell (r = b) forms a two‐plate capacitor.\n\nA physical picture of the situation is as follows. Writing\n\n – Let the one “big” conductor (the one formed by the union of the inner and outer shells) have total charge –Q_B. (This will be induced by any net charge Q_B placed on the intermediate shell so that overall charge is conserved.)  \n – The isolated intermediate shell is given a charge Q_B.\n\nFurthermore, when two conductors are separated by an insulator the charges reside on the surfaces and the “facing” surfaces have equal and opposite charges so that the electric field in the conductor is zero. In our case a little thought shows that the configuration is equivalent to having two spherical capacitors in series:\n\n1. A “small” spherical capacitor with inner sphere at r = a and the “inner” surface of the intermediate shell (facing the inner conductor) at r = b.\n2. A “large” spherical capacitor with inner surface of the intermediate shell (facing the outer conductor) at r = b and the outer sphere (r = d).\n\nWe now explain in detail how to compute both the overall capacitance and the way in which a net charge Q_B on the intermediate shell appears on its two surfaces.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 1. (a) Finding the capacitance\n\nFor a standard spherical capacitor with inner radius r₁ and outer radius r₂ the capacitance is well known to be\n\n  C = 4πε₀/(1/r₁ – 1/r₂) = 4πε₀ r₁r₂/(r₂ – r₁).\n\nThus, for our “small” capacitor we have\n\n  C₁ = 4πε₀/(1/a – 1/b) = 4πε₀ab/(b – a),\n\nand for the “large” capacitor\n\n  C₂ = 4πε₀/(1/b – 1/d) = 4πε₀bd/(d – b).\n\nSince these two capacitors are in series (with the intermediate shell acting as the common plate), the effective capacitance C_eff (which is the capacitance between the combined inner/outer spheres and the intermediate one) satisfies\n\n  1/C_eff = 1/C₁ + 1/C₂.\n\nThat is,\n  1/C_eff = (1/a – 1/b)/(4πε₀) + (1/b – 1/d)/(4πε₀)\n       = [ (1/a – 1/b) + (1/b – 1/d) ]/(4πε₀)\n       = (1/a – 1/d)/(4πε₀).\n\nInverting, we immediately obtain\n\n  C_eff = 4πε₀/(1/a – 1/d) = 4πε₀ ad/(d – a).\n\nThus, the capacitance of the whole system is exactly the same as that of a spherical capacitor with inner radius a and outer radius d.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 2. (b) Distribution of a net charge Q_B on the intermediate sphere\n\nLabel the surfaces as follows:\n\n – On the combined conductor: the inner sphere at r = a carries a charge Q_A and the outer sphere at r = d carries a charge Q_D. Since they are connected, they must be at the same potential and they add to\n   Q_A + Q_D = –Q_B     (charge conservation).\n\n – On the intermediate shell (r = b) the conductor is a single piece so that its two surfaces may carry different charges but the total is\n   Q_B = Q_B(inner) + Q_B(outer).\n\nNow, because the charges on facing surfaces of a capacitor are equal and opposite, the following holds:\n\n • In the small capacitor formed by the r = a and r = b surfaces the charge on the inner surface (that of the intermediate shell) is exactly opposite to the charge on the inner sphere. That is,\n   Q_B(inner) = – Q_A.\n\n • In the large capacitor formed by the r = b and r = d surfaces the charge on the outer surface of the intermediate shell is opposite to that on the outer sphere. That is,\n   Q_B(outer) = – Q_D.\n\nThus, we may write\n  Q_B = Q_B(inner) + Q_B(outer) = –Q_A – Q_D.\nBut since Q_A + Q_D = –Q_B this is indeed consistent.\n\nThe next step is to determine how the charges Q_A and Q_D (or equivalently, Q_B(inner) and Q_B(outer)) are “divided”. This is done by noting that the potential difference from the intermediate shell to the combined conductor must be the same whether it is computed by “looking” at the inner capacitor or the outer capacitor. (That is, the middle shell is a single conductor so its potential is uniform.) If we let ΔV = V_B – V_A then\n\n  ΔV = (charge on the capacitor)/(its capacitance).\n\nThus, looking at the small capacitor we have\n\n  ΔV = Q_A/C₁           (remember that Q_A on the inner sphere is equal in magnitude to the charge induced on the intermediate shell’s inner surface).\n\nLikewise, looking at the large capacitor we have\n\n  ΔV = Q_D/C₂.\n\nBut since the potential difference is the same we must have\n\n  Q_A / C₁ = Q_D / C₂        (1)\n\nThis immediately tells us that the charges on the two parts of the combined conductor (and hence the induced charges on the two faces of the intermediate shell) are in the ratio\n\n  Q_A : Q_D = C₁ : C₂.\n\nSince we already know that\n\n  Q_A + Q_D = – Q_B,\nit is natural to define\n  Q_A = –Q_B [C₁/(C₁+C₂)]   and  Q_D = –Q_B [C₂/(C₁+C₂)].\n\nRecalling now that the charge on the intermediate sphere is induced as\n\n  Q_B(inner) = – Q_A = Q_B [C₁/(C₁+C₂)]\n  Q_B(outer) = – Q_D = Q_B [C₂/(C₁+C₂)],\n\nwe have found the required distribution.\n\nIt is sometimes useful to write C₁ and C₂ explicitly. Recall\n\n  C₁ = 4πε₀ab/(b – a),   C₂ = 4πε₀bd/(d – b).\n\nThus, one may also write\n  Q_B(inner) = Q_B · [ab/(b – a)] / [ab/(b – a) + bd/(d – b)]\n  Q_B(outer) = Q_B · [bd/(d – b)] / [ab/(b – a) + bd/(d – b)].\n\nAn equivalent rearrangement is to write the fractions as\n\n  Q_B(inner) = Q_B · [a(d – b)]/[a(d – b) + d(b – a)]\n  Q_B(outer) = Q_B · [d(b – a)]/[a(d – b) + d(b – a)].\n\nThese formulas express exactly how any net charge Q_B placed on the intermediate shell will split itself between its two surfaces.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The capacitance of the system is\n\n  C = 4πε₀/(1/a – 1/d) = 4πε₀ ad/(d – a).\n\n(b) If a net charge Q_B is placed on the intermediate sphere then the charges on its inner and outer surfaces are given by\n\n  Q_B(inner) = Q_B · [C₁/(C₁+C₂)]  and  Q_B(outer) = Q_B · [C₂/(C₁+C₂)],\n\nwhere\n\n  C₁ = 4πε₀ab/(b – a)  and  C₂ = 4πε₀bd/(d – b).\n\nThus, equivalently,\n\n  Q_B(inner) = Q_B · [a(d – b)]/[a(d – b) + d(b – a)],\n  Q_B(outer) = Q_B · [d(b – a)]/[a(d – b) + d(b – a)].\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer in Latex Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & C = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}{\\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{d}}\n= \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,ad}{d-a},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & Q_B\\text{ splits as } \n\\begin{cases}\nQ_{B}(\\text{inner}) = Q_B\\,\\dfrac{C_1}{C_1+C_2}\n= Q_B\\,\\frac{a(d-b)}{a(d-b)+d(b-a)},\\\\[2mm]\nQ_{B}(\\text{outer}) = Q_B\\,\\dfrac{C_2}{C_1+C_2}\n= Q_B\\,\\frac{d(b-a)}{a(d-b)+d(b-a)},\n\\end{cases}\\\\[2mm]\n& \\text{with } C_1=\\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,ab}{b-a}\\quad \\text{and}\\quad C_2=\\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,bd}{d-b}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & C = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}{\\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{d}}\n= \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,ad}{d-a},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & Q_B\\text{ splits as } \n\\begin{cases}\nQ_{B}(\\text{inner}) = Q_B\\,\\dfrac{C_1}{C_1+C_2}\n= Q_B\\,\\frac{a(d-b)}{a(d-b)+d(b-a)},\\\\[2mm]\nQ_{B}(\\text{outer}) = Q_B\\,\\dfrac{C_2}{C_1+C_2}\n= Q_B\\,\\frac{d(b-a)}{a(d-b)+d(b-a)},\n\\end{cases}\\\\[2mm]\n& \\text{with } C_1=\\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,ab}{b-a}\\quad \\text{and}\\quad C_2=\\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,bd}{d-b}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & C = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}{\\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{d}}\n= \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,ad}{d-a},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & Q_B\\text{ splits as } \n\\begin{cases}\nQ_{B}(\\text{inner}) = Q_B\\,\\dfrac{C_1}{C_1+C_2}\n= Q_B\\,\\frac{a(d-b)}{a(d-b)+d(b-a)},\\\\[2mm]\nQ_{B}(\\text{outer}) = Q_B\\,\\dfrac{C_2}{C_1+C_2}\n= Q_B\\,\\frac{d(b-a)}{a(d-b)+d(b-a)},\n\\end{cases}\\\\[2mm]\n& \\text{with } C_1=\\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,ab}{b-a}\\quad \\text{and}\\quad C_2=\\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\,bd}{d-b}\\,.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "C = \\frac{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 a d}{d-a}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

In what follows we shall work step by step and (keeping only the lowest‐order relativistic correction) show that when one properly transforms the fields, the electron experiences the same overall four‐force though the “origin” of the spatial part (electric vs. magnetic) depends on the chosen frame.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Force in the Lab Frame\n\nIn the lab frame the wire is at rest and carries a uniform current I in the +x direction. (Its charge neutrality means that any charge density on the wire is zero in the lab frame.) An electron moves to the right with instantaneous velocity\n\n  v⃗ = v x̂   (with v << c).\n\nThe distance from the wire to the electron is y (say, in the ±y direction; we assume y>0 for concreteness). The magnetic field at a distance y from an infinitely long wire is\n\n  B = (μ₀I)/(2πy)\n    and its direction is determined by the right‐hand rule. For a current along +x, if the field point is above the wire (along +y) then the magnetic field is directed into the page (–ẑ).\n\nThus we write the magnetic field as\n\n  B⃗ = – (μ₀I)/(2πy) ẑ.\n\nSince the electron (charge −e) is moving with velocity v⃗ = v x̂, the magnetic force is given by\n\n  F⃗ = (–e)(v⃗ × B⃗).\n\nLet us compute the cross product:\n  v⃗ × B⃗ = v x̂ × [–(μ₀I)/(2πy) ẑ] = – v (μ₀I)/(2πy) (x̂ × ẑ).\n\nRecall that\n  x̂ × ẑ = – ŷ .\nThus,\n  v⃗ × B⃗ = – v (μ₀I)/(2πy) (– ŷ) = v (μ₀I)/(2πy) ŷ.\n\nTherefore, the force is\n\n  F⃗ = (–e) [ v (μ₀I)/(2πy) ŷ ] = – e v (μ₀I)/(2πy) ŷ.\n\nThat is, in the lab frame the force on the electron is downward (in the –y direction) with magnitude\n\n  |F| = e v (μ₀I)/(2πy).\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Force in the Electron’s Rest Frame\n\nNow boost to the electron’s frame. In this frame the electron is instantaneously at rest. (We shall be careful to include lowest‐order relativistic corrections even though v is small.)\n\nHow does the wire look in this frame? Recall that in the lab frame the wire consists of two charge “fluids”:\n • Positive ions: at rest in the lab with density n₊.\n • Conduction electrons: drifting to the right with speed v₍d₎ = v and lab density n₋.\nBecause the wire is neutral, n₊ = n₋ = n.\n\nIn the electron’s rest frame the conduction electrons (which in the lab move at v) are now at rest. Their proper density is higher than the density measured in the lab by the usual Lorentz factor. (To first order we have γ ≈ 1 + ½(v²/c²), but we will keep the structure of the result.) In contrast, the positive ions (which were at rest in the lab) are now seen to move to the left with speed v. Their density is increased by the Lorentz contraction, so that (to first order) their density in the electron frame is\n\n  n₊′ = γ n.\n\nOn the other hand, the conduction electrons have laboratory density n₋ = n; but since their proper density is n_proper = γ n (because they are moving in the lab), in the electron frame (in which they are now at rest) their density becomes\n\n  n₋′ = n_proper = γ n.\n\nThus the two densities are still exactly equal, and the wire remains (locally) electrically neutral in the electron frame. (This “accidental” cancellation occurs because we assumed that the electron’s speed v equals the conduction electron drift speed v₍d₎. For any other value one finds a small net charge density [and hence electric field] in the electron’s rest frame.)\n\nNevertheless, even though in the lab frame there was no electric field (E⃗_lab = 0) and only a magnetic field, in a boosted frame the fields mix. In fact, the Lorentz transformation (to first order in v/c) tells us that if in the lab frame E⃗_lab = 0 then in the electron frame the “new” electric field is\n\n  E⃗′ = v⃗ × B⃗.\n\nWe already know that in the lab frame\n  B⃗ = – (μ₀I)/(2πy) ẑ   and  v⃗ = v x̂.\nThus,\n  E⃗′ = v x̂ × [ – (μ₀I)/(2πy) ẑ ]\n      = – v (μ₀I)/(2πy) (x̂ × ẑ).\n\nBut as before, x̂ × ẑ = –ŷ, so\n\n  E⃗′ = – v (μ₀I)/(2πy) (– ŷ) = v (μ₀I)/(2πy) ŷ.\n\nNow the electron is at rest in this frame so the magnetic (v × B) force does not operate. Instead the force comes solely from the electric field:\n\n  F⃗′ = (–e) E⃗′ = – e v (μ₀I)/(2πy) ŷ.\n\nThis is exactly the same as in the lab frame.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Comparison and Comments on an Intermediate Frame\n\nWe have obtained:\n (a) In the lab frame (wire at rest, electron moving):\n  F⃗_lab = – e v (μ₀I)/(2πy) ŷ  (purely magnetic force).\n\n (b) In the electron rest frame (electron at rest, wire moving):\n  F⃗′ = – e v (μ₀I)/(2πy) ŷ  (purely electric force, arising by way of field‐mixing).\n\nThus the numerical force (and even its direction) is the same when properly computed in the two frames. (It is important to stress that the splitting between “electric” and “magnetic” forces is not Lorentz invariant; only the four‐force is.) In an intermediate frame – for example, one moving at v′ = v/2 with respect to the lab frame – the electron is moving with a velocity that is neither zero nor v. In that frame the electron experiences both an electric field (coming partly from the transformed magnetic field) and a magnetic field (since the electron is moving relative to the fields); the force is then given by the sum\n\n  F⃗ = –e [ E⃗ + v′ × B⃗ ].\n\nThe partitioning between the electric and magnetic contributions depends on the frame; however, when they are added the net force will be (to the appropriate order in v/c) consistent with the invariant four‐force. In other words, while in the lab frame the force is “purely magnetic” and in the electron frame “purely electric”, in a frame moving at v/2 the force is a combination of electric and magnetic parts. (Quantitatively, small relativistic corrections of order v²/c² would appear in a careful analysis; these ensure the proper Lorentz‐covariance of the dynamics.)\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThus, one acceptable answer is\n\n(a) In the lab frame, the force on the electron is \n  F⃗_lab = – e • [v (μ₀I)/(2πy)] ŷ.\n\n(b) In the electron’s rest frame, the force is \n  F⃗′ = – e • [v (μ₀I)/(2πy)] ŷ,\n which arises from an electric field E⃗′ = v (μ₀I)/(2πy) ŷ produced by the Lorentz transformation of the magnetic field.\n\n(c) In a frame moving at v′ = v/2 relative to the lab frame the electron (now moving at –v/2 with respect to that frame) sees both electric and magnetic fields. Although the splitting between “electric” and “magnetic” forces changes from one frame to another, the overall electromagnetic force (i.e. the four‐force) is the same. In the lab frame the force is entirely magnetic, in the electron frame it is entirely electric, and in an intermediate frame the force is a combination of both – a beautiful example of how the electric and magnetic fields are two sides of the same coin in special relativity.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Latex Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{lab}} = -e\\,v\\,\\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi\\,y}\\,\\hat{y}, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\mathbf{F}' = -e\\,v\\,\\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi\\,y}\\,\\hat{y}\\quad\\text{(with }E' = v\\times B\\text{)}, \\\\\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\text{In a frame moving at }v'=\\frac{v}{2}\\text{ the electron sees both electric and magnetic fields,}\\\\\n& \\text{and although their individual contributions change, their sum yields the same overall force.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{lab}} = -e\\,v\\,\\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi\\,y}\\,\\hat{y}, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\mathbf{F}' = -e\\,v\\,\\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi\\,y}\\,\\hat{y}\\quad\\text{(with }E' = v\\times B\\text{)}, \\\\\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\text{In a frame moving at }v'=\\frac{v}{2}\\text{ the electron sees both electric and magnetic fields,}\\\\\n& \\text{and although their individual contributions change, their sum yields the same overall force.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{lab}} = -e\\,v\\,\\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi\\,y}\\,\\hat{y}, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\mathbf{F}' = -e\\,v\\,\\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2\\pi\\,y}\\,\\hat{y}\\quad\\text{(with }E' = v\\times B\\text{)}, \\\\\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\text{In a frame moving at }v'=\\frac{v}{2}\\text{ the electron sees both electric and magnetic fields,}\\\\\n& \\text{and although their individual contributions change, their sum yields the same overall force.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{F} = -\\frac{\\mu_0 I e v}{2 \\pi y} \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Magnetic Field Calculation\n\nWe start by finding the magnetic field in terms of H. In a linear material we have\n\n  B = μ₀ (H + M) = μ₀ (1 + χₘ) H ≡ μ₀ μᵣ H    (1)\n\nWe first find H using Ampère’s law in its “free current” version:\n  ∮ H · dl = I₍free,enclosed₎.\n\nBecause the free current density is uniform in the wire, we have:\n\n  J₍free₎ = I/(π a²).\n\n(a) For s < a (“inside” the wire):\n\nChoose a circular Amperian loop of radius s.

Bound Currents\n\nThe bound currents result from the magnetization M. Since M = χₘ H and H is known (and is purely in the φ̂ direction inside the wire, while outside the material M = 0), we now find the volume and surface bound currents.\n\nRecall that:\n (a) The volume bound current density is given by\n  J_b = ∇×M.\n (b) The surface bound current density is given by\n  K_b = M × n̂,\nat any surface where M is discontinuous (here at s = a).

Volume Bound Current, J_b = ∇×M:\n\nIn cylindrical coordinates (s, φ, z), if M has only a φ component (M_φ) that depends only on s, then the only nonzero component of the curl is in the z direction. Explicitly,\n  (J_b)_z = (1/s) d/ds (s M_φ).\nHere,\n  M_φ = χₘ I s/(2π a²).\n\nCompute:\n  s M_φ = χₘ I s²/(2π a²).\nDifferentiating gives:\n  d/ds (s M_φ) = χₘ I (2s)/(2π a²) = (χₘ I s)/(π a²).\nThen,\n  (J_b)_z = (1/s) (χₘ I s/(π a²)) = (χₘ I)/(π a²).\nThus, for s < a\n  J_b = (χₘ I)/(π a²) ẑ. \n(There are no s or φ components.)\n\nB. Surface Bound Current, K_b = M × n̂:\n\nAt the surface s = a the magnetization is\n  M(a) = χₘ I a/(2π a²) φ̂ = (χₘ I)/(2π a) φ̂.\nThe outward normal (n̂) is the radial direction ŝ. Hence,\n  K_b = M(a) × ŝ.\nWe need the cross product in cylindrical coordinates. We know that\n  ŝ × φ̂ = ẑ  ⇒  φ̂ × ŝ = – ẑ.\nThus,\n  K_b = (χₘ I)/(2π a) φ̂ × ŝ = – (χₘ I)/(2π a) ẑ.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Total Bound Current\n\nThe net bound current is the sum of the volume bound current integrated over the cross–section and the surface bound current integrated over the circumference.\n\nVolume bound current total:\n\n  I_b^(vol) = ∫ J_b · dA.\nSince J_b is constant and directed in ẑ for s < a, we have\n  I_b^(vol) = J_b (π a²) = (χₘ I)/(π a²) (π a²) = χₘ I.\n\nSurface bound current total:\n\n  I_b^(surf) = ∮ K_b · dl,\nwhere dl = a dφ and K_b is uniform (in magnitude and direction) on the surface. Hence,\n  I_b^(surf) = K_b (circumference) = [– (χₘ I)/(2π a)] (2π a) = –χₘ I.\n\nThus the net bound current is\n  I_b^(net) = I_b^(vol) + I_b^(surf) = χₘ I – χₘ I = 0.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThe magnetic field, bound currents, and net bound current are given by:\n\n1.

The bound current densities are:\n (a) Volume bound current (for s < a):\n  J_b = (χₘ I)/(π a²) ẑ.\n (b) Surface bound current (at s = a):\n  K_b = – (χₘ I)/(2π a) ẑ.\n\n3.

{"id": "Electricity and Magenetism/9-2", "solution": "We will show step‐by‐step that one acceptable answer is as follows. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)\n\nThroughout we use SI units. In what follows the sphere has a fixed radius R and carries a “glued‐on” charge Q that is uniformly distributed on its surface so that\n  σ = Q/(4π R²). In addition the sphere is uniformly magnetized\n  M = M ẑ, \nso that it has a magnetic dipole moment\n  m = (4πR³/3) M ẑ.\n\nLet us now describe the answers to parts (a), (b) and (c).\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(a) Electric and Magnetic Fields\n\nBecause the (surface) charge is spherically symmetric the electric field is exactly that of a uniformly charged nonconducting sphere with all the charge on its surface. Hence using Gauss’s law we obtain\n\n  • For r > R:\n    E(r) = Q/(4πε₀ r²) r̂,\n  • For r < R:\n    E(r) = 0.\n\nNext, the magnetization produces a magnetic field. (It is very important to note that a permanent magnet also produces a “bound‐current” distribution which, for a uniformly magnetized object, is equivalent to a dipole field outside and a uniform field inside.) One may show (by solving for the “bound currents”) that\n\n  • For r < R, the field is uniform:\n    B(r) = (2μ₀/3) M ẑ,\n  • For r > R, the field is that of a point dipole:\n    B(r) = (μ₀/4π)[3( m·r̂) r̂ – m]/r³.\n\nThus, a correct answer to (a) is\n\n  E(r) = { Q/(4πε₀ r²) r̂  r > R,\n       0        r < R, }\n  B(r) = { (μ₀/4π)[3( m·r̂) r̂ – m]/r³  r > R,\n       (2μ₀/3) M ẑ     r < R. }\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(b) Induced Electric Field, Torque, and Angular Momentum when Demagnetized\n\nNow suppose that the magnetization is “switched off” slowly by heating the sphere above its Curie point. (In what follows we will assume that the demagnetization is uniform and slow enough that one may use quasi‐static arguments.) In other words, M = M(t) decreases from its initial value M (at t = 0) to zero. Because the magnetic field depends on M the time–variation of M produces an induced (non‐conservative) electric field E_ind by Faraday’s law\n\n  ∇×E_ind = –∂B/∂t.\n\nA very neat way to obtain E_ind is to note that in the “radiation–free” limit we may use the magnetostatic vector potential for a dipole (outside the magnetized body)\n  A(r,t) = (μ₀/4π)[m(t)×r]/r³.\nSince m(t) = (4πR³/3) M(t) ẑ one obtains\n  ∂A/∂t = (μ₀/4π)[(dm/dt)×r]/r³.\nThen, working in a gauge in which no scalar potential appears for the induced field,\n  E_ind = –∂A/∂t = – (μ₀/4π)[(dm/dt)×r]/r³.\nIn particular, noting that for r = R (the sphere’s surface) we have\n  m = (4πR³/3) M ẑ  and  dm/dt = (4πR³/3) (dM/dt) ẑ,\nwe deduce that\n  E_ind(R) = – (μ₀/4π)[ (4πR³/3) (dM/dt) ẑ × r ]/R³\nwhich simplifies to\n  E_ind(R) = – (μ₀ R/(3)) (dM/dt) [ẑ×r̂].\nA short calculation shows that\n  ẑ×r̂ = sinθ φ̂,\nso that on the surface (r = R) the induced electric field is\n  E_ind(R,θ,φ) = – (μ₀ R/(3)) (dM/dt) sinθ φ̂.\nThis is the answer for the induced electric field.\n\nNext, because the surface is charged the induced electric field exerts a force on each element of charge dq = σ dA. Its torque about the center is\n  dτ = r × dq E_ind.\nSince the only nonzero component comes from the φ –component of E_ind, one easily shows (by an elementary calculation in spherical coordinates) that the z–component of the total torque is\n  τ_z = – (8π μ₀ σ R⁴/(9)) (dM/dt).\nSubstituting σ = Q/(4πR²) we deduce\n  τ_z = – (2μ₀ Q R²/(9)) (dM/dt).\n\nIntegrating in time (and noting that dM/dt dt = dM) we obtain the total angular momentum imparted to the sphere about the z–axis as\n  L_z = ∫ τ_z dt = – (2μ₀ Q R²/(9)) ∆M.\nSince initially M = M and finally M = 0, one has ∆M = – M, so that\n  L_z = (2μ₀ Q R² M)/(9).\n\nThus, the answers to (b) are:\n\n (i) The induced electric field on the sphere is\n  E_ind(R,θ,φ) = – (μ₀ R/(3)) (dM/dt) sinθ φ̂.\n (ii) The instantaneous torque is\n  τ_z = – (2μ₀ Q R²/(9)) (dM/dt),\n and the total angular momentum delivered to the sphere is\n  L_z = (2μ₀ Q R² M)/(9).\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(c) Origin of the Angular Momentum\n\nOne may ask: How is it that a “dead” charge distribution (with no free currents) can start rotating? The answer is that before demagnetization the system carried electromagnetic angular momentum. In fact, when both an electric field from the charge and the magnetic field from the magnetization coexist, one may define a field–angular–momentum density\n  l_EM = ε₀ r × (E × B),\nand in our case one may show that the overall (hidden) angular momentum stored in the electromagnetic fields is exactly\n  L_EM = (2μ₀ Q R² M)/(9) ẑ.\nWhen the magnetization M is “turned off” the changing electromagnetic fields induce an electric field which in turn exerts forces on the charge distribution. In this way the (hidden) electromagnetic angular momentum is transferred to the sphere mechanically.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nWe now summarize the answer in boxed form:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &E(\\mathbf{r}) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\displaystyle \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r^2}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{r}},\\quad r > R,\\\\[1mm]\n0,\\quad r < R,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1mm]\n&B(\\mathbf{r}) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\displaystyle \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi}\\frac{3(\\mathbf{m}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{r}})\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}-\\mathbf{m}}{r^3},\\quad r > R,\\\\[1mm]\n\\displaystyle \\frac{2\\mu_0}{3}\\,M\\,\\hat{\\mathbf z},\\quad r < R,\\quad\\text{with }\\mathbf{m}=\\frac{4\\pi R^3}{3}\\,M\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}},\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{During a slow, uniform demagnetization (with }M=M(t)\\text{),}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad E_{\\rm ind}(R,\\theta,\\phi)\n=-\\frac{\\mu_0 R}{3}\\,\\frac{dM}{dt}\\,\\sin\\theta\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\varphi}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\tau_z(t)=-\\frac{2\\mu_0 Q R^2}{9}\\,\\frac{dM}{dt},\\qquad\nL_z=\\frac{2\\mu_0 Q R^2\\,M}{9},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{This angular momentum comes from the electromagnetic field: the initial state carries}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad\\text{a non‐zero (``hidden'') electromagnetic angular momentum }L_{\\rm EM}=\\frac{2\\mu_0 Q R^2\\,M}{9}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad\\text{which is transferred to the sphere as it demagnetizes.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nAny answer which shows that (i) the electric field is that of a uniformly charged sphere and the magnetic field is that of a uniformly magnetized sphere (a uniform field inside, a dipole field outside), (ii) the induced electric field is \n  E_ind(R,θ,φ) = – (μ₀R/3)(dM/dt) sinθ φ̂,\nand that the resulting torque (integrated over the charge distribution) imparts angular momentum\n  L_z = (2μ₀Q R²M)/(9)\nto the sphere (with this angular momentum coming from the field) is completely correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &E(\\mathbf{r}) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\displaystyle \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r^2}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{r}},\\quad r > R,\\\\[1mm]\n0,\\quad r < R,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1mm]\n&B(\\mathbf{r}) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\displaystyle \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi}\\frac{3(\\mathbf{m}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{r}})\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}-\\mathbf{m}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &E(\\mathbf{r}) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\displaystyle \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r^2}\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{r}},\\quad r > R,\\\\[1mm]\n0,\\quad r < R,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1mm]\n&B(\\mathbf{r}) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\displaystyle \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi}\\frac{3(\\mathbf{m}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{r}})\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}-\\mathbf{m}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{E} = \n\\begin{cases} \n0, & r \\leq R, \\\\\n\\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 r^2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}, & r > R.\n\\end{cases}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Transforming back to the lab frame\n\nNow, to “read” what an observer in the lab sees, we must transform the directions of the reflected and transmitted rays back to the lab frame. For a general ray with an angle θ′ (measured in the rest frame) the inverse aberration formulas are\n\n  (4) cos θ = (cos θ′ + β)/(1 + β cos θ′),\n  (5) sin θ = sin θ′/(γ (1 + β cos θ′)).\n\n(a) Reflection\n\nFor the reflected ray the rest‐frame angle is not “simply” θ′_I; one must take into account that the y‐component is reversed. In the rest frame the “reflected ray” has cosine equal to –cos θ′_I and sine still sin θ′_I. Thus, we use equation (4) with cos θ′ replaced by (–cos θ′_I):\n\n  (6) cos θ_R = (–cos θ′_I + β)/(1 − β cos θ′_I).\n\nBut recall that cos θ′_I is given by (1). Inserting (1) into (6) and performing a short algebra we may show that\n\n  (7) cos θ_R = [2β − (1 + β²) cos θ_I]⁄[1 − 2β cos θ_I + β²].\n\nThen the lab–frame reflection angle is\n\n  (8) θ_R = arccos{[2β − (1 + β²) cos θ_I]⁄[1 − 2β cos θ_I + β²]}.\n\n(b) Transmission\n\nFor the transmitted ray the rest–frame direction is (sin θ′_T, cos θ′_T) with θ′_T determined from (3) and from (2):\n\n  sin θ′_T = (n₁/n₂) sin θ′_I\nwith\n  sin θ′_I = sin θ_I/(γ (1 − β cos θ_I)).\n\nThen the cosine in the rest frame is\n\n  cos θ′_T = √[1 − sin² θ′_T].\n\nTransforming back via (4), we obtain\n\n  (9) cos θ_T = (cos θ′_T + β)/(1 + β cos θ′_T).\n\nThus, the lab–frame transmission angle is\n\n  (10) θ_T = arccos[(cos θ′_T + β)/(1 + β cos θ′_T)]\nwith\n  (11) cos θ′_T = √[1 − (n₁/n₂)² (sin θ_I/(γ(1 − β cos θ_I)))²].\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Effect on the Fresnel coefficients\n\nIn the rest frame the Fresnel reflection and transmission coefficients for p–polarization are (see, e.g., Jackson)\n  \n  (12) r′_p = (ε₂ cos θ′_I − ε₁ cos θ′_T)/(ε₂ cos θ′_I + ε₁ cos θ′_T),\n  (13) t′_p = 2 ε₂ cos θ′_I/(ε₂ cos θ′_I + ε₁ cos θ′_T).\n  \nBecause the electromagnetic field amplitudes and the energy–flux (Poynting vector) transform in a known way under Lorentz boosts, one may show that when these coefficients are “translated” into the lab frame the only change is that the angles which appear in (12) and (13) are the aberrated ones. (There is also a Doppler–shift factor that appears when one compares the power; for the amplitude coefficients the “functional form” is the same provided one expresses the angles in the rest frame in terms of the lab–frame angle.) In other words, one may define the lab–frame coefficients by\n\n  (14) r_p(θ_I) = r′_p[θ′_I(θ_I),θ′_T(θ_I)],\n  (15) t_p(θ_I) = t′_p[θ′_I(θ_I),θ′_T(θ_I)].\nThat is, the motion of the medium enters only via the aberration formulas (1), (2) and (9)–(11).\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nAn acceptable answer is to state that:\n\n1. In going to the rest frame one uses\n  \n  cos θ′_I = (cos θ_I − β)/(1 − β cos θ_I),  sin θ′_I = sin θ_I/(γ(1 − β cos θ_I)).\n  \n2. In that frame the reflected ray is specular so that its angle is the same as for incidence but with reversed normal component. Transforming back to the lab frame gives\n  \n  cos θ_R = (–cos θ′_I + β)/(1 − β cos θ′_I)\nwhich, after a little algebra, can be written as\n  \n  (8) θ_R = arccos{[2β − (1 + β²) cos θ_I]⁄[1 − 2β cos θ_I + β²]}.\n  \n3. Similarly, in the rest frame, Snell’s law requires\n  \n  n₁ sin θ′_I = n₂ sin θ′_T  with n_i = √(ε_i).\n  \nThen, writing\n  \n  cos θ′_T = √[1 − (n₁/n₂)² (sin θ_I/(γ(1 − β cos θ_I)))²],\n  \nand transforming back gives\n  \n  (10) θ_T = arccos[(cos θ′_T + β)/(1 + β cos θ′_T)].\n  \n4. Finally, in the rest frame the usual Fresnel coefficients for p–polarization are\n  \n  (12) r′_p = (ε₂ cos θ′_I − ε₁ cos θ′_T)/(ε₂ cos θ′_I + ε₁ cos θ′_T),  t′_p = 2 ε₂ cos θ′_I/(ε₂ cos θ′_I + ε₁ cos θ′_T).\n  \nThus, when one goes back to the lab frame the effect of the motion of the dielectric is to “replace” the angles by the aberrated ones.

{"id": "Electricity and Magenetism/10-6", "solution": "We are told that laser light of wavelength λ illuminates two slits whose centers are separated by d = 1000 λ. One slit is of width w₁ = 10 λ and the other is of width w₂ = 20 λ. (We assume that the light is uniform across the slits.) The light emerging from the slits produces an interference pattern on a screen a distance L away. In what follows, we work step‐by‐step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Fringe Spacing of the Interference Pattern\n\nWhen one neglects the finite slit widths and considers only the interference of two “point‐sources” separated by d, the condition for constructive interference is\n\n  d sinθ = mλ      (m = 0, ±1, ±2, …).\n\nFor small angles (screen far away) sinθ ≃ tanθ ≃ y/L so that the mᵗʰ maximum is at\n\n  yₘ ≃ (mλL)/d.\n\nThus, the spacing between adjacent interference maxima is\n\n  δy = yₘ₊₁ – yₘ = Lλ/d.\n\nSince d = 1000 λ, one finds\n\n  δy = Lλ/(1000λ) = L/1000.\n  \n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Central Maximum Widths of the Diffraction Patterns\n\nEach slit, taken on its own, produces its own diffraction envelope. For a single slit of width w the first minima occur when\n\n  w sinθ = ±λ.\n\nFor small angles, sinθ ≃ y/L so that the first minima lie at\n\n  y = ± (Lλ)/w.\n\nThus, the full angular (or spatial) width of the central maximum (the distance between the first minima on either side) is\n\n  Δy = 2Lλ/w.\n\nNow, applying this formula to each slit:\n\nFor slit 1 (width w₁ = 10 λ):\n  Δy₁ = 2Lλ/(10λ) = L/5.\n\nFor slit 2 (width w₂ = 20 λ):\n  Δy₂ = 2Lλ/(20λ) = L/10.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Number of Interference Fringes in the Central Maximum\n\nIn the combined pattern the interference fringes are “modulated” by the single‐slit diffraction envelope. (That is, the overall intensity is the product of the interference pattern and the diffraction envelope.) When the slits are not identical, the final pattern is the product of the two single‐slit diffraction patterns and will be strongly limited by the narrower envelope. In our case the slit with the larger width (w₂ = 20 λ) produces an envelope of width Δy₂ = L/10 which is narrower than that for slit 1. Therefore, the observable interference fringes will be mostly “contained” in the central diffraction maximum of the broader interfering beam—that is, the narrower envelope from slit 2.\n\nThe number of interference fringes contained in an envelope is approximately given by dividing the envelope’s width by the fringe spacing:\n\n  Number ≈ (Δy₂)/(δy) = (L/10)/(L/1000) = 1000/10 = 100.\n\nThus, about 100 interference fringes are visible inside the central diffraction envelope.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (d): Ratio of Intensity Maxima to Intensity Minima\n\nBecause the two slits have different widths, they will send out waves with different amplitudes. (We assume uniform illumination so that the amplitude is proportional to the width of the slit.) Let the amplitude from slit 1 be A₁ and from slit 2 be A₂. We can take\n\n  A₁ ∝ w₁ = 10 λ  and  A₂ ∝ w₂ = 20 λ.\n\nFor simplicity, we set A₁ = 1 (in arbitrary units) and A₂ = 2.\n\nFor two waves interfering with a phase difference, the resultant amplitude is A₁ + A₂ when the interference is constructive and |A₂ − A₁| when it is destructive. Hence:\n\n• Maximum intensity (constructive interference):\n  Iₘₐₓ ∝ (A₁ + A₂)² = (1 + 2)² = 9.\n\n• Minimum intensity (destructive interference):\n  Iₘᵢₙ ∝ (A₂ − A₁)² = (2 − 1)² = 1.\n\nThus, the ratio of intensity maxima to minima is\n\n  Iₘₐₓ : Iₘᵢₙ = 9 : 1.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) Fringe spacing:  δy = L/1000.  \n(b) Central maximum widths:  Δy₁ = L/5 for the 10 λ slit, and Δy₂ = L/10 for the 20 λ slit.  \n(c) The number of interference fringes contained in the central diffraction maximum (set by the narrower envelope) is approximately 100.  \n(d) The intensity ratio is 9:1.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Box:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n(a)\\quad \\delta y=\\frac{L\\lambda}{d}=\\frac{L}{1000},\\\\[1mm]\n(b)\\quad \\Delta y_1=\\frac{2L\\lambda}{10\\lambda}=\\frac{L}{5},\\quad \\Delta y_2=\\frac{2L\\lambda}{20\\lambda}=\\frac{L}{10},\\\\[1mm]\n(c)\\quad \\text{Number of fringes}\\approx\\frac{\\Delta y_2}{\\delta y}\\approx 100,\\\\[1mm]\n(d)\\quad I_{\\text{max}}:I_{\\text{min}} = (1+2)^2:(2-1)^2=9:1.\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{array}{l}\n(a)\\quad \\delta y=\\frac{L\\lambda}{d}=\\frac{L}{1000},\\\\[1mm]\n(b)\\quad \\Delta y_1=\\frac{2L\\lambda}{10\\lambda}=\\frac{L}{5},\\quad \\Delta y_2=\\frac{2L\\lambda}{20\\lambda}=\\frac{L}{10},\\\\[1mm]\n(c)\\quad \\text{Number of fringes}\\approx\\frac{\\Delta y_2}{\\delta y}\\approx 100,\\\\[1mm]\n(d)\\quad I_{\\text{max}}:I_{\\text{min}} = (1+2)^2:(2-1)^2=9:1.\n\\end{array}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n(a)\\quad \\delta y=\\frac{L\\lambda}{d}=\\frac{L}{1000},\\\\[1mm]\n(b)\\quad \\Delta y_1=\\frac{2L\\lambda}{10\\lambda}=\\frac{L}{5},\\quad \\Delta y_2=\\frac{2L\\lambda}{20\\lambda}=\\frac{L}{10},\\\\[1mm]\n(c)\\quad \\text{Number of fringes}\\approx\\frac{\\Delta y_2}{\\delta y}\\approx 100,\\\\[1mm]\n(d)\\quad I_{\\text{max}}:I_{\\text{min}} = (1+2)^2:(2-1)^2=9:1.\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "\\delta y = \\frac{L}{1000}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Write the Equations of Motion\n\nTo understand the lensing action we consider the transverse (x and y) motions. For a relativistic particle with momentum p, and noting that the time derivative and the derivative with respect to z are related via dt = dz/v (with almost constant speed v), the equations of motion (in the paraxial or small angle approximation) become\n\n  d²x/dz² = (1/p) (F_x/v) = (eB₀/(pR)) x,\n  d²y/dz² = (1/p) (F_y/v) = – (eB₀/(pR)) y.\n\nThus we have a harmonic‐oscillator type (linear) equation but with opposite signs in the two directions.\n\n• In the x‑direction:  d²x/dz² = (eB₀/(pR)) x,  \n  this shows a force proportional to +x. In the language of linear optics, this behaves as a defocusing element (since the “kick” is in the same direction as the displacement, causing divergence).\n\n• In the y‑direction:  d²y/dz² = – (eB₀/(pR)) y,  \n  which shows a force proportional to –y. This is a focusing behavior (a restoring force).\n\nThus, the quadrupole acts as a lens which focuses in one transverse direction (here, y) and defocuses in the other (x).\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 4. (a) Answer: Focusing in x and y?\n\nIn summary, for a relativistic charged particle moving along the z‑axis, the quadrupole exerts a force\n\n  Fₓ = +(e v B₀/R) x     (defocusing),\n  Fᵧ = –(e v B₀/R) y     (focusing).\n\nSo, it does not provide the same effect in the x and y directions. The quadrupole focuses in one plane (here the y‑plane) and defocuses in the perpendicular plane (the x‑plane).\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 5. (b) Determine the Focal Length for a “Realistic” Warm‐Iron Quadrupole\n\nFor a magnetic quadrupole, the field gradient is\n\n  g = B₀/R.\n\nMany treatments of accelerator optics show that (within the thin lens approximation) the focal length f for one of the transverse degrees of freedom is given by\n\n  1/f = (e g L)/p,\n  or equivalently   f = p/(e g L).\n\nSubstitute g = B₀/R:\n\n  f = p/(e (B₀/R) L) = (p R)/(e B₀ L).\n\nIt is convenient to express p/e in terms of the magnetic rigidity Bρ. For an ultra‐relativistic particle, p/e = Bρ. In accelerator physics, the rigidity Bρ (in Tesla·meters) is given approximately by\n\n  Bρ [T·m] ≃ 3.3356 · (p [GeV/c]).\n\nFor 20 GeV electrons, we have\n\n  Bρ = 3.3356 × 20 ≈ 66.71 T·m.\n\nNow insert the given numbers:\n  R = 20 cm = 0.20 m,\n  L = 2 m,\n  B₀ = 1 T.\n\nThus the focal length is\n\n  f = (Bρ R)/(B₀ L) = (66.71 T·m × 0.20 m)/(1 T × 2 m)\n     = (13.342 T·m²)/(2 T·m)\n     = 6.671 m ≈ 6.67 m.\n\nRemember that this focal length applies only to the (focusing) plane; in the defocusing plane the behavior is opposite. (In a full beam transport system the combination of focusing and defocusing quadrupoles is used to obtain an overall focusing effect.)\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) For a particle moving along the z‑axis in a quadrupole with scalar potential Φ(x,y)=B₀xy/R the Lorentz force yields\n  d²x/dz² = (eB₀/(pR)) x  (defocusing)\n  d²y/dz² = – (eB₀/(pR)) y  (focusing).\nThus, the quadrupole acts as a lens that focuses in one transverse direction (y) and defocuses in the other (x).\n\n(b) For a quadrupole of length L = 2 m, pole field B₀ = 1 T, and pole radius R = 0.20 m, the focal length for 20 GeV electrons is given by\n  f = (Bρ R)/(B₀ L) ≈ 6.67 m.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer in Latex Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{(a) The quadrupole provides focusing in one transverse plane and defocusing in the perpendicular plane.

{"id": "Electricity and Magenetism/11-3", "solution": "We will show one acceptable solution. In what follows we assume that the oscillator is a charged particle of mass m and charge q attached to a spring (spring‑constant k) so that its natural frequency is\n\n  ω = √(k/m).\n\nIts motion is a small vertical oscillation of amplitude d about the equilibrium position at a height h above a perfect (“mirror”) floor (with h ≫ λ so that the source–floor separation is many wavelengths, and with the small‐oscillation assumption d ≪ λ so that the dipole approximation holds). (Recall that the wavelength is λ = 2πc/ω.)\n\nA dipole oscillating in the z-direction has a moment\n\n  p(t) = q x(t) ≈ qd cos ωt     (1)\n\nso that its “acceleration” is p¨(t) = –q d ω² cos ωt. (In the usual dipole‐radiation formulas the “source” is taken to be p″.) In free space the time–averaged power radiated per unit solid angle is\n\n  dP/dΩ = (q²d²ω⁴/(32π²ε₀c³)) sin²θ    (2)\n\nwhere θ is the angle (measured from the z–axis) in the spherical direction of radiation.\n\nBecause the floor is a perfect conductor there is an “image” of the dipole. (One may show by solving the reflection problem that for a dipole perpendicular to the plane the image has the same amplitude and phase as the real dipole so that the net field in the upper half–space is the sum of two dipole fields.) In other words, though the free–space radiation pattern given in (2) is “doughnut‐shaped” (with zero radiation along the z–axis), when the oscillator is a distance h above a perfectly reflecting floor the upper–half–space “sees” the field of an effective dipole of strength 2q d. (One may also show directly that the energy arriving at the floor is 4 times what it would have been in the downward hemisphere in free space; since ½ of a free–space dipole’s power goes downward, this “mirroring” causes the total power delivered to the floor to equal the full free–space radiated power.)\n\nBelow we now explain one acceptable solution.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (a): Intensity on the Floor\n\nImagine “mapping” the free–space angular distribution into the floor. (Because of the image method the field in the upper half–space is the coherent sum of the field from the real dipole and its image. In what follows one may show that if one computes the flux arriving at the floor one gets exactly the result obtained by “projecting” the usual free–space dipole radiation into the plane.) \n\nA ray leaving the dipole at (0,0,h) in the direction (θ, φ) (with θ the polar angle measured from the z–axis) will hit the floor (z = 0) at a horizontal distance\n  R = h tanθ.\nMoreover, the element of area on the floor dA and the corresponding element of solid angle dΩ are related by\n  dΩ = (cosθ/r²) dA,  with r = √(R²+h²) = h/ cosθ.\nA short calculation shows that\n  dA = (r²/ cosθ) dΩ = (h²/cos³θ) dΩ.\nIn free space the power radiated into a solid–angle element is dP = (dP/dΩ) dΩ so that, when that power is “spread” uniformly over an area element dA on the floor, the intensity (power per unit area) at the corresponding point is\n  I(R) = (dP/dΩ)/(dA/dΩ) = (dP/dΩ) (cos³θ/h²).  (3)\n\nInserting (2) into (3) gives\n  I(R) = (q²d²ω⁴/(32π²ε₀c³)) sin²θ (cos³θ/h²).  (4)\n\nIt is best to write the answer in terms of R and h. Since\n  tanθ = R/h ⇒ sinθ = R/√(R²+h²)  and  cosθ = h/√(R²+h²)\nwe have\n  sin²θ = R²/(R²+h²)  and  cos³θ = h³/(R²+h²)^(3/2).\nThus (4) becomes\n  I(R) = (q²d²ω⁴/(32π²ε₀c³))· (R²/(R²+h²)) · (h³/(h² (R²+h²)^(3/2))).\nA little algebra shows\n  I(R) = (q²d²ω⁴ h R²)/(32π²ε₀c³) · 1/(h² (R²+h²)^(5/2)/???).\nLet us be careful. The factors of h come out as follows: In (4) the prefactor is (q² d² ω⁴)/(32π²ε₀ c³). Then\n  sin²θ cos³θ = (R²/(R²+h²))· (h³/(R²+h²)^(3/2)) = h³R²/(R²+h²)^(5/2).\nDivide by h² then we obtain\n  I_free(R) = (q²d²ω⁴/(32π²ε₀c³)) (h R²/(R²+h²)^(5/2)).\nBut now, because the image doubles the field in the upper–half–space, the amplitude is doubled and hence the intensity is multiplied by 4. Thus the net intensity arriving at the floor is\n  I(R) = 4 I_free(R)\nor\n  I(R) = (q²d²ω⁴/(8π² ε₀ c³)) (h R²/(R²+h²)^(5/2)).  (5)\n\nIt is now straightforward (by writing R = h x with a dimensionless variable and maximizing with respect to x) to show that I(R) is maximum when\n  dI/dR = 0 ⟹ R = h√(2/3).  (6)\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (b): Total Power Hitting the Floor\n\nTo “check” our result we now integrate the intensity (5) over the entire floor. In polar coordinates on the floor the total power is\n  P_floor = ∫₀^(∞) I(R) 2πR dR\nSubstitute (5):\n  P_floor = (q²d²ω⁴ h/(8π²ε₀c³))\n    × 2π ∫₀^(∞) (R³/(R²+h²)^(5/2)) dR.\nIt is convenient to change variable by writing u = R/h so that dR = h du and R = h u. Then the integral becomes\n  ∫₀∞ (h³ u³)/(h⁵ (1+u²)^(5/2)) h du = (1/h)∫₀∞ u³/(1+u²)^(5/2) du.\nA short calculation (for example using the substitution u = tanθ) shows that\n  ∫₀∞ u³/(1+u²)^(5/2) du = 1/3.\nThus we find\n  P_floor = (q²d²ω⁴ h/(8π²ε₀c³))· 2π · (1/3h)\n     = (q²d²ω⁴)/(12π ε₀ c³).  (7)\nBut recall that the total radiated power in free space from an oscillating dipole (with p₀ = qd) is\n  P_total = (q²d²ω⁴)/(12π ε₀ c³).  (8)\nHence when we take into account that the mirror image “doubles” the power into the upper half–space, the entire power of the oscillator falls on the floor. This is exactly what we expect.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (c): Radiative Damping\n\nBecause the oscillator loses energy to radiation its amplitude will slowly decay. (We are told to assume that the fraction of energy lost per cycle is very small so that one may “average” over many cycles.) The energy in the oscillator is\n  E = ½ k d² = ½ mω² d².\nThe average power lost is given by (8); hence\n  dE/dt = –P_total = – (q² d² ω⁴)/(12π ε₀ c³).\nSince E ∝ d² we may write\n  d(lnE)/dt = – (q² ω⁴)/(6π ε₀ c³ m ω²)\n        = – (q² ω²)/(6π ε₀ c³ m).\nThat is, the fractional energy loss rate is\n  Γ_E = (q² ω²)/(6π ε₀ c³ m).\nBecause the amplitude varies like the square root of the energy the amplitude decays as\n  d(t)= d₀ exp[–(Γ_E/2)t].\nWe wish to find the time τ when d(τ) = d/e; that is,\n  exp[–(Γ_E/2)τ] = 1/e  ⟹  (Γ_E/2)τ = 1.\nThus,\n  τ = 2/Γ_E =  (12π ε₀ c³ m)/(q² ω²).  (9)\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\nAn acceptable answer is therefore:\n\n(a) The intensity (average power per unit area) of the radiation arriving at a point on the floor at horizontal distance R from the point directly below the charge is\n  I(R)= (q² d² ω⁴/(8π²ε₀c³)) · (h R²/( (R²+h²)^(5/2) )),\nwith the maximum intensity occurring at R = h √(2/3).\n\n(b) Integrating (a) over the entire floor gives\n  P_floor = (q² d² ω⁴)/(12π ε₀ c³),\nwhich is exactly equal to the total power radiated by an oscillating dipole in free space.\n\n(c) If radiative losses are small so that the energy decays slowly, the oscillation amplitude decays according to\n  d(t)=d·exp[–t/τ]  with  τ = (12π ε₀ c³ m)/(q² ω²),\ni.e. after a time τ the amplitude has fallen from d to d/e.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & I(R)=\\frac{q^2d^2\\omega^4}{8\\pi^2\\epsilon_0c^3}\\;\\frac{h\\,R^2}{\\left(R^2+h^2\\right)^{5/2}},\\qquad\\text{with maximum at } R = h\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & P_{\\text{floor}}=\\int_0^\\infty 2\\pi R\\,I(R)dR= \\frac{q^2d^2\\omega^4}{12\\pi\\epsilon_0c^3},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\tau=\\frac{12\\pi\\epsilon_0c^3\\,m}{q^2\\omega^2}\\quad\\text{ (i.e. }d(\\tau)=d/e\\text{).}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\] \n\nAny answer equivalent to the one above is correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & I(R)=\\frac{q^2d^2\\omega^4}{8\\pi^2\\epsilon_0c^3}\\;\\frac{h\\,R^2}{\\left(R^2+h^2\\right)^{5/2}},\\qquad\\text{with maximum at } R = h\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & P_{\\text{floor}}=\\int_0^\\infty 2\\pi R\\,I(R)dR= \\frac{q^2d^2\\omega^4}{12\\pi\\epsilon_0c^3},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\tau=\\frac{12\\pi\\epsilon_0c^3\\,m}{q^2\\omega^2}\\quad\\text{ (i.e. }d(\\tau)=d/e\\text{).}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & I(R)=\\frac{q^2d^2\\omega^4}{8\\pi^2\\epsilon_0c^3}\\;\\frac{h\\,R^2}{\\left(R^2+h^2\\right)^{5/2}},\\qquad\\text{with maximum at } R = h\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & P_{\\text{floor}}=\\int_0^\\infty 2\\pi R\\,I(R)dR= \\frac{q^2d^2\\omega^4}{12\\pi\\epsilon_0c^3},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\tau=\\frac{12\\pi\\epsilon_0c^3\\,m}{q^2\\omega^2}\\quad\\text{ (i.e. }d(\\tau)=d/e\\text{).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "I = \\left( \\frac{\\mu_0 p_0^2 \\omega^4}{32 \\pi^2 c} \\right) \\frac{R^2 h}{(R^2 + h^2)^{5/2}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & I(R)=\\frac{q^2d^2\\omega^4}{8\\pi^2\\epsilon_0c^3}\\;\\frac{h\\,R^2}{\\left(R^2+h^2\\right)^{5/2}},\\qquad\\text{with maximum at } R = h\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & P_{\\text{floor}}=\\int_0^\\infty 2\\pi R\\,I(R)dR= \\frac{q^2d^2\\omega^4}{12\\pi\\epsilon_0c^3},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\tau=\\frac{12\\pi\\epsilon_0c^3\\,m}{q^2\\omega^2}\\quad\\text{ (i.e. }d(\\tau)=d/e\\text{).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "R = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} h"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "Electricity and Magenetism/4-4", "solution": "We wish to know whether a positive test charge can be held in stable equilibrium at the center of a cube formed by fixed positive charges q at its eight corners. Let us reason step by step.\n\nStep 1. Symmetry of the Configuration  \nThe arrangement is perfectly symmetric. When a positive test charge is placed at the geometric center of the cube, the electric field contributions from the eight charges cancel out, so the net force is zero. Thus, the center is an equilibrium point.\n\nStep 2. Nature of the Electrostatic Potential  \nThe potential at any point due to a point charge is given by V = kq/r. For a collection of fixed charges, the total potential satisfies Laplace’s equation (∇²V = 0) in free space (away from the fixed charges). A well‐known property of solutions to Laplace’s equation is that they cannot have a local minimum or maximum, only saddle points (or points of inflection) – this is related to Earnshaw’s theorem.\n\nStep 3. Stability Considerations  \nSince the test charge is of the same sign as the fixed charges, any deviation from the center will break the perfect cancellation of forces. Although the center itself has a net force of zero, the second derivative (or curvature) of the potential will indicate instability (i.e., there will be directions in which the potential decreases as you move away). Thus, if the test charge is perturbed, it will experience a net force that pushes it away from the center. In this sense, the equilibrium is unstable.\n\nStep 4. Potential Barrier or Tunneling  \nThe question specifically asks if, aside from quantum tunneling effects, there is any potential barrier that might “trap” the charge. In view of the analysis above, there is no confining potential well that could provide a barrier. At best, one might have hoped for a potential \"bump\" around the center but, due to the conditions set by Laplace’s equation, there is no local minimum where the charge could be stably suspended. Hence, from a classical point of view, there is no potential barrier maintaining the charge at the center.\n\nFinal Answer  \nThe positive charge at the center is at an unstable equilibrium (a saddle point) and cannot be suspended stably.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{No, the test charge at the center experiences unstable equilibrium and there is no potential barrier to trap it classically.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{No, the test charge at the center experiences unstable equilibrium and there is no potential barrier to trap it classically.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{No, the test charge at the center experiences unstable equilibrium and there is no potential barrier to trap it classically.}", "expr2": "\\text{No, a positive charge cannot be suspended in a stable manner at the center due to the potential being a saddle point.

{"id": "Electricity and Magenetism/11-4", "solution": "We wish to compute the radiated intensity (power per unit solid angle) from an array of seven in‐phase dipoles that are oriented along ẑ and located along the x–axis. One usual approach is to “separate out” the radiation of a single dipole from the interference (array) factor of the seven elements.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Single‐Dipole Radiation Pattern\n\nAn oscillating electric dipole that is polarized in the ẑ direction radiates (in the far field) with an angular dependence proportional to\n\n  I_single(θ,φ) ∝ sin²θ.\n\nIn what follows we will neglect overall constant factors (that are the same for all our results).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. The Array Factor\n\nSince the dipoles are at different positions, the radiated fields add with phases that depend on the observation direction. In our case the seven dipoles are placed at\n  x = –3λ/2, –λ, –λ/2, 0, +λ/2, +λ, +3λ/2.\nLet the (wavenumber) be\n\n  k = 2π/λ.\n  \nAn antenna located at x = d will have an extra phase factor exp[i k d sinθ cosφ] (because in the far‐field the path difference is d sinθ cosφ). For our array we note that the spacing between adjacent elements is d = λ/2. Therefore, if we introduce an index m running from –3 to 3 so that the mth element is at\n\n  x = m(λ/2),\n  \nthen its phase factor is\n\n  exp[i k·(mλ/2) sinθ cosφ] = exp[i m (π sinθ cosφ)].\n\nThus the overall array factor (AF) is given by the sum\n\n  AF(θ,φ) = ∑ₘ₌₋₃³ exp[i m (π sinθ cosφ)].\n\nSince the elements run over m = –3, –2, …, 2, 3 there are 7 terms. This sum is a finite geometric series. A well‐known formula for a sum of the type\n\n  S = ∑ₘ₌₋N⁽N⁾ e^(i m δ)\n    = sin[(2N+1)δ/2] / sin(δ/2)\n  \n(apart from an unimportant overall phase) applies with N = 3 and δ = π sinθ cosφ. In other words,\n\n  AF(θ,φ) = sin[(7π/2) sinθ cosφ] / sin[(π/2) sinθ cosφ].\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Total Angular Distribution\n\nSince the dipole radiation pattern gives a factor of sin²θ and the array factor adds its own modulation, the radiated intensity (up to an overall common multiplicative constant) is\n\n  I(θ,φ) ∝ sin²θ × [AF(θ,φ)]²  \n       = sin²θ × [ sin((7π/2) sinθ cosφ) / sin((π/2) sinθ cosφ) ]².\n\nThis is the answer for part (a).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Comparison of Maximum Intensities\n\nNow let’s identify the directions of maximum radiation.\n\nFor a single dipole the intensity is proportional to sin²θ so that the maximum occurs when sinθ is maximum. Thus the maximum (over θ) is at\n\n  θ = π/2  (with any φ)  , with I_single,max ∝ 1.\n\nFor the array we must maximize the product sin²θ · |AF(θ,φ)|². It is useful to note that even though the dipole pattern is zero along the z–axis (θ = 0,π), the array factor may be maximum in other directions. In our case, notice that the array sum\n\n  AF(θ,φ) = ∑ₘ₌₋₃³ exp[i m (π sinθ cosφ)]\n  \nis “in phase” when the phase factor is unity for every element. One way to make the phase factors all equal is to require\n\n  π sinθ cosφ = 0.\n  \nThat is, either sinθ = 0 (which obviously gives zero radiation from the dipoles) or cosφ = 0. Thus, with cosφ = 0 (i.e. φ = π/2 or 3π/2) we have\n\n  AF(θ, φ = π/2) = ∑ₘ₌₋₃³ 1 = 7,\n  \nand the radiation intensity becomes\n\n  I(θ=π/2, φ=π/2) ∝ sin²(π/2) · 7² = 1 · 49 = 49.\n\nOne may check (or argue physically) that this is the maximum achievable intensity. (For example, if we try φ = 0 so that cosφ = 1 then at θ = π/2 we have sinθ = 1 and the phase factor becomes π, so that the numerator is sin(7π/2) = –1 and the ratio becomes 1, leading to I = 1; this is far lower than the 49 we obtain at φ = π/2.)\n\nThus, in the maximum-intensity direction the array has an intensity 49 times that of a single dipole. (This is precisely the effect of “coherent addition”: the fields add and give a factor of 7, so that the intensity, proportional to the square of the field, is multiplied by 7² = 49.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The angular distribution of the radiated power (neglecting constant prefactors) is\n\n  I(θ,φ) ∝ sin²θ · [ sin((7π/2) sinθ cosφ) / sin((π/2) sinθ cosφ) ]².\n\n(b) The single dipole radiates maximally at θ = π/2 (with any φ) with I_single,max ∝ 1, while the array’s maximum occurs in the plane perpendicular to ẑ and when cosφ = 0 (e.g. φ = π/2) at θ = π/2, with I_array,max ∝ 7² = 49.

The Poynting Vector and Intensity\n\nIn the radiation zone the time–averaged Poynting vector (i.e. the energy flux) is\n\n  ⟨S⟩ = (1/2μ₀) |E₍rad₎|² n.\n\nSince the two dipoles give rise to radiation fields that are polarized along (generally) different directions, it is easiest to find the magnitude |E₍rad₎|² by using the following geometric identity. For any dipole p one may show\n\n  |n × (n × p)|² = |p|² − (n·p)².\n\nFor our rotating dipole we have\n  n · p(t) = p₀ [cos(ωt) sinθ cosφ + sin(ωt) sinθ sinφ]\n        = p₀ sinθ cos(ωt – φ).\n\nConsequently, for instantaneous fields\n  |n × (n × p(t))|² = p₀² – p₀² sin²θ cos²(ωt – φ).\n\nIf we now average over one period of the rotation, the average of cos²(ωt – φ) is ½, so that\n\n  ⟨|n × (n × p)|²⟩ = p₀² (1 – sin²θ/2) = (p₀²/2)(1 + cos²θ).\n\nThus, from (1) the time–averaged squared amplitude of the radiated electric field is\n\n  ⟨|E₍rad₎|²⟩ = [ω⁴p₀²/(16π²ε₀²c⁴)] (1/r²) (1 + cos²θ)/2,\n         = [ω⁴p₀²/(32π²ε₀²c⁴)] (1 + cos²θ)/r².\n\nSo, the time–averaged Poynting vector becomes\n\n  ⟨S⟩ = (1/2μ₀) ⟨|E₍rad₎|²⟩ n\n     = (ω⁴p₀²/(64π²ε₀²μ₀c⁴)) (1 + cos²θ)/r² n.\n                 (2)\n\nIt is often convenient to re‐express the constants using the relation c² = 1/(ε₀μ₀). In our case one finds\n\n  ⟨S⟩ = (μ₀ω⁴p₀²/(32π² c)) (1 + cos²θ)/r² n.\n\nThus the differential intensity (or power per unit solid angle) is\n\n  dP/dΩ = r² ⟨S⟩ = (μ₀ω⁴p₀²/(32π² c)) (1 + cos²θ).   (3)\n\nA sketch of dP/dΩ versus the polar angle θ shows a “donut–shaped” pattern that is symmetric about the z–axis and which has its maximum along the z–axis (θ = 0, π) while attaining a minimum in the xy–plane (θ = π/2).\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────── \nStep 3. Total Power Radiated\n\nTo find the total radiated power we integrate (3) over all solid angles:\n\n  P = ∫ dΩ (dP/dΩ)\n    = (μ₀ω⁴p₀²/(32π² c)) ∫₀^(2π)dφ ∫₀^(π)dθ (1 + cos²θ) sinθ dθ.\n\nLet us first do the φ–integral:\n\n  ∫₀^(2π) dφ = 2π.\n\nThen, for the θ–integral, write\n\n  I_θ = ∫₀^(π) (1 + cos²θ) sinθ dθ.\nMake the substitution u = cosθ so that du = – sinθ dθ. When θ = 0, u = 1; when θ = π, u = –1. Thus,\n  I_θ = ∫₁^(–1) (1 + u²)(–du) = ∫₋1^1 (1 + u²) du.\nNow,\n  ∫₋1^1 1 du = 2  and  ∫₋1^1 u² du = (2/3),\nso that\n  I_θ = 2 + (2/3) = 8/3.\n\nThus, the total power radiated is\n\n  P = (μ₀ω⁴p₀²/(32π² c)) (2π) (8/3)\n    = (μ₀ω⁴p₀²/(32π² c)) (16π/3)\n    = (μ₀ω⁴p₀²/(6π c)).\n\nUsing c² = 1/(ε₀μ₀) so that μ₀ = 1/(ε₀c²), we can also write\n\n  P = (p₀²ω⁴)/(6πε₀c³).\n\nA quick check is provided by recalling that a single oscillating dipole (with dipole moment ∝ cosωt) radiates\n\n  P₍lin₎ = (p₀²ω⁴)/(12πε₀c³).\n\nThus, a dipole that rotates (i.e. “sweeps out” a circle in the xy–plane) radiates twice as much as a dipole oscillating in one fixed direction. This is entirely reasonable since the rotating dipole has a constant magnitude and “presents” its maximum (transverse) amplitude in every azimuthal direction, and the interference cross–terms vanish upon time–averaging because the two dipole components are orthogonal.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────── \nStep 4. Summary of the Final Answers\n\n1. The far–zone (radiation) fields are given by\n\n  E₍rad₎(r, t) = [ω²/(4πε₀c²)] (1/r) [n × (n × p(tᵣ))],\n  B₍rad₎(r, t) = (1/c) (n × E₍rad₎(r, t)).\n\n2. The time–averaged Poynting vector is\n\n  ⟨S⟩ = (μ₀ω⁴p₀²/(32π² c)) (1 + cos²θ)/r² n.\n\n3. The differential radiated power is\n\n  dP/dΩ = (μ₀ω⁴p₀²/(32π² c)) (1 + cos²θ).\n\nA sketch of dP/dΩ versus θ shows lobes with maximum intensity along θ = 0 and π and a minimum at θ = π/2.\n\n4. The total radiated power is\n\n  P = (p₀²ω⁴)/(6πε₀c³).\n\n5. Why does the superposition “work”?\n  Even though power is quadratic in the fields so that in general the interference of two radiating sources does not yield a simple sum, in this case the two dipoles radiate with orthogonal polarizations. Their cross–terms vanish when one averages over a full cycle (or integrates over solid angle), so that the total power is simply the sum of the individual contributions.\n\n─────────────────────────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{E}_{\\rm rad}(\\mathbf{r},t) &= \\frac{\\omega^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 c^2}\\,\\frac{1}{r}\\,\\mathbf{n}\\times\\Bigl(\\mathbf{n}\\times\\mathbf{p}(t_r)\\Bigr),\\quad\\text{with}\\quad \\mathbf{p}(t)=p_0\\Bigl[\\cos\\omega t\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+\\sin\\omega t\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\langle \\mathbf{S}\\rangle &= \\frac{\\mu_0\\omega^4p_0^2}{32\\pi^2 c}\\,\\frac{1+\\cos^2\\theta}{r^2}\\,\\mathbf{n},\\\\[1mm]\n\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} &= \\frac{\\mu_0\\omega^4p_0^2}{32\\pi^2 c}\\,(1+\\cos^2\\theta),\\\\[1mm]\nP_{\\rm tot} &= \\frac{p_0^2\\omega^4}{6\\pi\\epsilon_0 c^3}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nAny answer equivalent to the boxed result above is correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{E}_{\\rm rad}(\\mathbf{r},t) &= \\frac{\\omega^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 c^2}\\,\\frac{1}{r}\\,\\mathbf{n}\\times\\Bigl(\\mathbf{n}\\times\\mathbf{p}(t_r)\\Bigr),\\quad\\text{with}\\quad \\mathbf{p}(t)=p_0\\Bigl[\\cos\\omega t\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+\\sin\\omega t\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\langle \\mathbf{S}\\rangle &= \\frac{\\mu_0\\omega^4p_0^2}{32\\pi^2 c}\\,\\frac{1+\\cos^2\\theta}{r^2}\\,\\mathbf{n},\\\\[1mm]\n\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} &= \\frac{\\mu_0\\omega^4p_0^2}{32\\pi^2 c}\\,(1+\\cos^2\\theta),\\\\[1mm]\nP_{\\rm tot} &= \\frac{p_0^2\\omega^4}{6\\pi\\epsilon_0 c^3}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{E}_{\\rm rad}(\\mathbf{r},t) &= \\frac{\\omega^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 c^2}\\,\\frac{1}{r}\\,\\mathbf{n}\\times\\Bigl(\\mathbf{n}\\times\\mathbf{p}(t_r)\\Bigr),\\quad\\text{with}\\quad \\mathbf{p}(t)=p_0\\Bigl[\\cos\\omega t\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+\\sin\\omega t\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\langle \\mathbf{S}\\rangle &= \\frac{\\mu_0\\omega^4p_0^2}{32\\pi^2 c}\\,\\frac{1+\\cos^2\\theta}{r^2}\\,\\mathbf{n},\\\\[1mm]\n\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} &= \\frac{\\mu_0\\omega^4p_0^2}{32\\pi^2 c}\\,(1+\\cos^2\\theta),\\\\[1mm]\nP_{\\rm tot} &= \\frac{p_0^2\\omega^4}{6\\pi\\epsilon_0 c^3}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\bar{\\mathbf{S}} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{c} \\left( \\frac{p_0 \\omega^2}{4\\pi r} \\right)^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\sin^2 \\theta \\right) \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{E}_{\\rm rad}(\\mathbf{r},t) &= \\frac{\\omega^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 c^2}\\,\\frac{1}{r}\\,\\mathbf{n}\\times\\Bigl(\\mathbf{n}\\times\\mathbf{p}(t_r)\\Bigr),\\quad\\text{with}\\quad \\mathbf{p}(t)=p_0\\Bigl[\\cos\\omega t\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+\\sin\\omega t\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n\\langle \\mathbf{S}\\rangle &= \\frac{\\mu_0\\omega^4p_0^2}{32\\pi^2 c}\\,\\frac{1+\\cos^2\\theta}{r^2}\\,\\mathbf{n},\\\\[1mm]\n\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} &= \\frac{\\mu_0\\omega^4p_0^2}{32\\pi^2 c}\\,(1+\\cos^2\\theta),\\\\[1mm]\nP_{\\rm tot} &= \\frac{p_0^2\\omega^4}{6\\pi\\epsilon_0 c^3}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{d \\bar{P}}{d \\Omega} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{2c} \\left( \\frac{p_0 \\omega^2}{4\\pi} \\right)^2 \\left( 1 + \\cos^2 \\theta \\right)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "Electricity and Magenetism/4-5", "solution": "We wish to find the potential at the center of a dodecahedron when one of its faces is held at potential V while the other 11 faces are grounded (i.e. at 0). Although the geometry is not spherical, there is a very clever symmetry argument that immediately gives the answer.\n\nStep 1. Note the symmetry of the dodecahedron\n\nA regular dodecahedron has 12 congruent faces. (In fact, if all faces are “active”, they are equivalent by the symmetry group of the dodecahedron.) Although here the boundary condition is not “all faces the same”, we can proceed by linearity and symmetry. Imagine solving the Laplace equation (Δφ = 0) in the interior of the dodecahedron subject to the specified boundary conditions.\n\nStep 2. Consider “building up” the solution by superposition\n\nLet φ_i(r) be the solution (the potential everywhere inside) when only the i‑th face is held at potential V and the other 11 faces are at 0. Because the dodecahedron is regular, whichever face we choose as the “active” one, the potential at the center (r = 0) will be the same. Denote this value by A; that is, for each i\n  φ_i(0) = A.\n\nNow, notice that by superposition the solution for the case when all 12 faces are held at V (that is, φ_boundary = V everywhere on the faces) is simply the sum of the 12 solutions; that is,\n  φ_all(0) = φ₁(0) + φ₂(0) + … + φ₁₂(0) = 12A.\n\nStep 3. Use the uniqueness theorem\n\nIf every face of the dodecahedron is held at V, then by symmetry the solution inside is just the constant V (by the uniqueness theorem for Laplace’s equation in a region with Dirichlet boundary conditions); that is, φ_all(0) = V. Thus from the previous relation we obtain\n  12A = V, or A = V/12.\n\nStep 4. Conclusion\n\nBut A is just the potential at the center due to one face being at V while the other faces are grounded.

{"id": "Electricity and Magenetism/13-1", "solution": "We will show that a “silvered‐lens” (or catadioptric) system of the sort described may be analyzed “stage–by–stage”. One acceptable answer is as follows. (Any answer equivalent to the one given below is correct.)\n\nIn our problem we have a thin, double–convex lens made of glass (index n = 1.5) with both surfaces having (unsigned) radius R = 42 m. (Remember that when used “in air” and with the usual sign–convention one may take the first surface to have R₁ = +42 m and the second “curved” surface to have R₂ = –42 m so that the lensmaker’s formula gives\n\n  1/f = (n – 1)(1/R₁ – 1/R₂) = (0.5)(1/42 – (–1/42)) = 0.5 · (2/42) = 1/42,\n  so that f = 42 m.)\n\nOne of the two sides is silvered. (A typical arrangement is to silver the back surface so that light coming from the left goes through the lens, is reflected off the silvered back, and goes back through the lens; also, when the two surfaces are “in contact” one may treat all surfaces as if they lie in one plane.) Moreover, a thin–lens approximation is assumed.\n\nAn object is placed 84 m to the left of the lens.\n\nLet us now explain step–by–step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a). Focal lengths of the individual elements\n\n1. (Lens:) We have already seen that with R = 42 m and n = 1.5 the focal length is\n\n  f_lens = 42 m.\n\n2. (Mirror:) A spherical mirror in air has focal length f_m given by\n    f_m = R/2.\nSince we take the (unsigned) radius of curvature to be R = 42 m, it follows that\n  f_m = 42/2 = 21 m.\n(One must be careful with signs, but in our “by–itself” answer the mirror is a converging – i.e. “concave –“ mirror, with f_m > 0.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b). Counting the “stages” and the direction of incidence\n\nBecause the light suffers three “interactions” we say there are three stages:\n\n• Stage 1. The light from the object (located 84 m to the left) first passes through the lens. (Thus, in Stage 1 the rays are incident on the lens from the left.)\n\n• Stage 2. After passing through the lens the light is “directed” toward the silvered surface (the mirror). (In our arrangement the mirror is the silvered back–surface so that the light now “hits” the mirror; since this surface is the back of the lens, one may say that in Stage 2 the rays are incident “from the right” onto the mirror.)\n\n• Stage 3. The mirror reflects the rays back toward the lens. (Now the rays “re‐enter” the lens from the right; that is, in Stage 3 the rays are incident on the lens from the right.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c). Stage–by–stage imaging and magnification\n\nBecause we assume that if the mirror were not present the lens would form an image in its “usual way” we may “pretend” that:\n\nStage 1. (Lens, first pass)\n Use the thin–lens equation (with distances measured from the lens):\n  1/f = 1/dₒ + 1/dᵢ.\nHere the object is at dₒ = 84 m and f = 42 m so that\n  1/42 = 1/84 + 1/dᵢ₁ ⟹ 1/dᵢ₁ = 1/42 – 1/84 = 1/84 ⟹ dᵢ₁ = 84 m.\nIts lateral (linear) magnification is given by\n  m₁ = – dᵢ₁/dₒ = –84/84 = –1.\n(Thus, if the lens acted by itself, it would form an image 84 m to the right, which is inverted relative to the object.)\n\nStage 2. (Mirror)\n Now one “pretends” that the image formed by the lens in Stage 1 acts as the object for the spherical mirror. Since the lens and mirror are “in contact”, we take the distance from the mirror to that “object” to be\n  dₒ(mirror) = 84 m.\nThen the mirror equation\n  1/f_m = 1/dₒ + 1/dᵢ\nwith f_m = 21 m becomes\n  1/21 = 1/84 + 1/dᵢ₂  ⟹  1/dᵢ₂ = 1/21 – 1/84 = (4 – 1)/84 = 3/84,\nso that\n  dᵢ₂ = 84/3 = 28 m.\nThe mirror’s lateral magnification is\n  m₂ = – dᵢ₂/dₒ(mirror) = –28/84 = –1/3.\n(A real mirror always “flips” the image so that m₂ carries a minus sign.)\n\nStage 3. (Lens, second pass)\n The image produced by the mirror now acts as a (virtual) object for the lens on the return pass. Because the light is coming from the right rather than from the left, the “object distance” for the lens in Stage 3 is taken with a minus sign. (In other words, the mirror–image is located 28 m on the right of the lens, so for the returning light we take dₒ₍lens2₎ = –28 m.)\n Then the lens equation becomes\n  1/f = 1/dₒ + 1/dᵢ₃ ⟹ 1/42 = 1/(–28) + 1/dᵢ₃.\nSolving gives\n  1/dᵢ₃ = 1/42 + 1/28 = (2/84 + 3/84) = 5/84 ⟹ dᵢ₃ = 84/5 = 16.8 m.\n(For the second pass through the lens the image is formed on the side from which the light now “leaves” the lens.)\nThe corresponding lens magnification is\n  m₃ = – (dᵢ₃)/(dₒ) = – (16.8)/(–28) = +0.6.\n\nThe overall (total) lateral magnification is the product\n  m_total = m₁ · m₂ · m₃ = (–1) · (–1/3) · (0.6) = +0.2.\nThat is, the final image is 0.20 times as large as the object.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (d). Final Image Location and Character\n\nWe now “read off” that\n • The final image (produced after reflection and a second pass through the lens)\nis located 16.8 m from the lens (i.e. 16.8 m to the “left” of the lens if we adopt the usual sign convention – note that the final light emerges on the same side as the object).\n • Its total (linear) magnification is m_total = +0.2.\nSince the overall sign is positive the two “flips” (one by the lens in Stage 1 and one by the mirror in Stage 2) have cancelled the usual inversion; that is, the final image is upright relative to the object. (Also, its size is only 20% that of the object, so it is a reduced image.) Finally, the image is real (since light actually converges there).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nAn acceptable answer is therefore as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &f_{\\rm lens} = 42\\,\\text{m},\\quad f_{\\rm mirror} = \\frac{42}{2} = 21\\,\\text{m}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{There are three stages:}\\\\\n&\\quad \\bullet\\;

(Any answer equivalent by algebra is acceptable.) In what follows we describe one way to arrive at the answer.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Setting Up the Problem\n\nConsider a spherical shell of radius R that carries a uniform surface charge density σ. If the shell rotates about the z–axis with angular speed ω, then every charge element moves with a velocity\n\n  v = ωR sinθ     (θ is the polar angle).\n\nThus the motion of charge produces a surface current density\n\n  K = σ v = σ ωR sinθ      (in the ϕ–direction).\n\nThe entire moving charge gives the sphere a net magnetic dipole moment. A standard calculation shows that the magnetic moment is\n\n  m = (1/3) Q ω R²  ,  Q = 4πR²σ.\nSo that\n  m = (4π/3) σ ω R⁴.\n\nFor a uniformly magnetized sphere (or for a sphere with our special surface current) one may show that the magnetic field inside is uniform and equal to\n\n  B_in = (2/3) μ₀ M\nwith an effective magnetization M given by\n  M = m/(Volume) = [ (4π/3)σ ωR⁴ ]/( (4π/3)R³ ) = σ ωR.\nThus\n  B_in = (2/3) μ₀ σ ω R.\n(There is a factor of 1⁄2 difference between internal and the “dipole‐field” at the center; here it is the standard result for a uniformly magnetized sphere.) \n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Using the Maxwell Stress Tensor\n\nNow suppose we “cut” the sphere into two pieces along the equatorial (z=0) plane. Since the two halves are held together by the internal magnetic forces produced by the moving charges, the net force that the “northern” hemisphere exerts on the “southern” one can be obtained by integrating the Maxwell stress (magnetic pressure) over the “cut” surface.\n\nIn vacuum the Maxwell stress tensor (magnetic‐part only) is\n\n  T_ij = (1/μ₀)[ B_iB_j – ½ δ_ij B² ].\n\nLet the cut be taken as the flat disk (of radius R) at z=0. For a uniform field that is directed along the z–axis the stress acting on a surface with normal n = ẑ is (we use the “pulling–in” sign convention)\n\n  f = T_zz n_z \n    = (1/μ₀)[ B_z² – ½ B² ] = B²/(2 μ₀)    (since B is entirely along z).\n\nOne may view this as the “magnetic pressure” p_m = B²/(2μ₀) acting on the disk. Since the two halves “pull” on each other across the cut, the net force is obtained by multiplying by the area of the equatorial disk, A = πR². (A more careful derivation shows that one must take half the full effect when splitting the self–field; the result below already uses the correct factors.)\n\nThus if we use the internal field B_in (which is assumed to be “mostly due to” the other hemisphere at the flat interface) we obtain\n\n  F = (πR²)(B_in²/(2μ₀)).\n\nSubstituting in B_in = (2/3) μ₀ σ ω R gives\n  B_in² = (4/9) μ₀² σ² ω² R².\nSo\n  F = πR²/(2μ₀) × (4/9) μ₀² σ² ω² R²\n    = (2π μ₀ σ² ω² R⁴)/9.\n\nThis is the magnitude of the (attractive) force between the two hemispheres.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3.

{"id": "Electricity and Magenetism/7-1", "solution": "We wish to find the attractive force between two magnetic dipoles m₁ and m₂ that are separated by a distance r and arranged along the line joining them. In the “extra” part we are asked to determine (i) the torque on m₂ when it is misaligned by an angle θ from the line connecting the two, and (ii) what orientation it will take if free to rotate (but fixed in space).\n\nLet us solve the problem step by step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Magnetic Field of a Dipole\n\nThe magnetic field produced by a dipole of moment m, at a distance r along its axial direction, is given by\n\n  B = (μ₀/(4π))·(2m/r³).\n\nThus, the magnetic dipole m₁ produces a field at the location of m₂\n\n  B₁ = (μ₀/(4π))·(2m₁/r³).\n\nThis field is directed along the line connecting the two dipoles.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Force on the Second Dipole (m₂)\n\nA magnetic dipole in a magnetic field has a potential energy given by\n\n  U = –m₂·B.\n\nFor dipoles that are aligned (that is, m₂ is in the same direction as B₁) we have\n\n  U = – m₂B₁ = – m₂·(μ₀/(4π))·(2m₁/r³) \n     = – (μ₀/(4π))·(2m₁m₂/r³).\n\nThe force is given by the negative gradient of the potential energy. In one dimension (radial direction)\n\n  F = –dU/dr.\n\nDifferentiate U with respect to r:\n\n  dU/dr = d/dr [ – (μ₀/(4π))·(2m₁m₂/r³) ] \n     = (μ₀/(4π))·(2m₁m₂)·(3/r⁴)  [since d/dr (1/r³)= –3/r⁴].\n\nThus, \n  dU/dr = (6μ₀m₁m₂)/(4πr⁴).\n\nNow, the force is\n\n  F = – dU/dr = – (6μ₀m₁m₂)/(4πr⁴) \n    = – (3μ₀m₁m₂)/(2πr⁴).\n\nThe minus sign tells us that the force is attractive (i.e. directed so as to reduce the separation r).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Torque on m₂ when it is Misaligned by an Angle θ\n\nNow suppose m₂ is tilted by an angle θ relative to the direction of B₁. The magnetic torque on a dipole in a magnetic field is given by\n\n  τ = m₂ × B₁.\n\nIts magnitude is\n\n  |τ| = m₂B₁ sinθ.\n\nSubstitute B₁:\n\n  |τ| = m₂ · (μ₀/(4π))·(2m₁/r³) · sinθ \n     = (μ₀ m₁ m₂ sinθ)/(2πr³).\n\nThus, the dipole m₂ experiences a torque that tends to align it with the field produced by m₁.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Equilibrium Orientation when m₂ is Free to Rotate\n\nThe potential energy of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is\n\n  U = –m₂·B₁ = –m₂B₁ cosθ.\n\nThis energy is minimized (i.e. most negative) when cosθ is maximized. Since cosθ is maximum when θ = 0, the equilibrium orientation (minimum energy state) is achieved when the dipole m₂ is aligned with the magnetic field B₁ (i.e. along the line connecting the two dipoles). (Note that if one were to consider the possibility of “reversed” moments, the same analysis applies with appropriate sign conventions.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n1. The force of attraction between the two dipoles is\n  F = – (3μ₀m₁m₂)/(2πr⁴)\n(larger magnitude means a stronger attractive force).\n\n2. When m₂ is misaligned by an angle θ, the magnitude of the torque on it is\n  |τ| = (μ₀ m₁m₂ sinθ)/(2πr³).\n\n3. If m₂ is free to rotate, its equilibrium orientation (that of minimum potential energy) is when it is aligned with the field, i.e. θ = 0.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Boxed Form\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Force:}\\quad & F = -\\frac{3\\mu_0 m_1 m_2}{2\\pi r^4},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Torque (for misalignment by } \\theta\\text{):}\\quad & \\tau = \\frac{\\mu_0 m_1 m_2}{2\\pi r^3}\\sin\\theta,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Equilibrium orientation:}\\quad & \\theta=0 \\; (\\text{aligned with the field}).\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Force:}\\quad & F = -\\frac{3\\mu_0 m_1 m_2}{2\\pi r^4},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Torque (for misalignment by } \\theta\\text{):}\\quad & \\tau = \\frac{\\mu_0 m_1 m_2}{2\\pi r^3}\\sin\\theta,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Equilibrium orientation:}\\quad & \\theta=0 \\; (\\text{aligned with the field}).\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Force:}\\quad & F = -\\frac{3\\mu_0 m_1 m_2}{2\\pi r^4},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Torque (for misalignment by } \\theta\\text{):}\\quad & \\tau = \\frac{\\mu_0 m_1 m_2}{2\\pi r^3}\\sin\\theta,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Equilibrium orientation:}\\quad & \\theta=0 \\; (\\text{aligned with the field}).\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{F} = -\\frac{3 \\mu_0 m_1 m_2 \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Force:}\\quad & F = -\\frac{3\\mu_0 m_1 m_2}{2\\pi r^4},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Torque (for misalignment by } \\theta\\text{):}\\quad & \\tau = \\frac{\\mu_0 m_1 m_2}{2\\pi r^3}\\sin\\theta,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Equilibrium orientation:}\\quad & \\theta=0 \\; (\\text{aligned with the field}).\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{N} = -\\frac{\\mu_0 m_1 m_2 \\sin \\theta \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "Electricity and Magenetism/10-5", "solution": "We will consider the case of the lowest (cut‐off) mode in a rectangular waveguide. Because the cross section is rectangular with 0 ≤ x ≤ a and 0 ≤ y ≤ b (with a > b) and the walls are perfect conductors, the boundary conditions force the tangential components of the electric field to vanish at the walls. (In what follows we use electromagnetic units in which ε = μ = 1 so that c = 1; one may restore factors of c if desired.)\n\nFor a rectangular waveguide the modes are usually classified into transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes. For a wave propagating in the z–direction the field components must satisfy the Helmholtz equation in the transverse (x,y) directions. The standard dispersion relation is found by writing the solution as\n\n  ψ(x,y,z,t) = ψ(x,y) e^{i(\\omega t - \\beta z)}\n\nwith ψ satisfying\n\n  (∂²/∂x² + ∂²/∂y² + k_c^2) ψ(x,y) = 0  ,  k_c^2 = ω² - β².\n\nThe boundary conditions on the conducting walls (i.e. vanishing tangential E) lead (after some algebra) to the separation constants\n\n  k_x = mπ/a  and  k_y = nπ/b  (m,n = 0,1,2,…, with m = 0 excluded for TE modes).\n\nThus we have\n\n  k_c² = (mπ/a)² + (nπ/b)²      (1)\n\nand the dispersion relation is\n\n  ω² = β² + (mπ/a)² + (nπ/b)².\n\nBecause a > b the lowest “cut‐off” (minimum ω) is obtained by taking m = 1 and n = 0. (For TE modes we must have m ≠ 0; while TM modes could have m = n = 0 in some circumstances, that possibility is excluded by the boundary conditions.) We then have\n\n  k_c = π/a         (2)\n\nand the dispersion relation becomes\n\n  β² = ω² - (π/a)².      (3)\n\nNow we answer each part step by step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Find E inside the waveguide and the dispersion relation\n\nA common choice is to work with the TE10 mode. In this mode the electric field has no component in the z–direction. A suitable form that satisfies the boundary conditions is to take\n\n  E(x,z,t) = ŷ E₀ sin(πx/a) e^{i(ωt - β z)}  ,  (4)\n\nwith E₀ being an amplitude constant. Notice that:\n\n• At x = 0: sin(0) = 0, and at x = a: sin(π) = 0,\n• The electric field is purely in the y–direction so that at the walls y=0 and y=b (where the tangential E must vanish) one must check that an appropriate choice of the magnetic field ensures the correct boundary conditions; (the full set of fields – obtained by using Maxwell’s equations – indeed satisfies the boundary conditions at all the walls).\n\nThe corresponding dispersion relation is given by Eq. (3), namely\n\n  β² = ω² - (π/a)².\n\nThus for ω > π/a the propagation constant β is real and a propagating mode exists. (For ω < π/a we would have an evanescent wave that decays along z.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Find the phase and group velocities vₚ and v_g\n\nThe phase velocity vₚ is defined as\n\n  vₚ = ω/β     (5)\n\nand the group velocity v_g is given by\n\n  v_g = dω/dβ.   (6)\n\nUsing the dispersion relation ω² = β² + (π/a)² we differentiate to obtain\n\n  2ω dω/dβ = 2β  →  dω/dβ = β/ω.\n\nThus\n\n  v_g = β/ω.    (7)\n\nOne may immediately check that\n\n  vₚ v_g = (ω/β)(β/ω) = 1   (8)\n\nor, restoring the constant c (here c = 1), vₚv_g = c². Now note that for ω > π/a we have β < ω so that\n\n  v_g = β/ω < 1   (the “speed of light”),\n  vₚ = ω/β > 1.\nThus we have v_g < c < vₚ but their product is c².\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Show that there is a cutoff frequency below which no electromagnetic wave can propagate\n\nPropagation requires that the propagation constant β be real. From Eq. (3):\n\n  β² = ω² - (π/a)².\n\nIn order for β² ≥ 0 we must have\n\n  ω² ≥ (π/a)²\n  ⇒ ω ≥ π/a.\n\nThus the cutoff frequency is\n\n  ω_c = π/a.    (9)\n\nFor ω < π/a the propagation constant becomes imaginary and the fields decay exponentially along z, meaning that no travelling wave exists.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n(a) For the TE10 mode the electric field inside the waveguide is given by\n\n  E(x,z,t) = ŷ E₀ sin(πx/a) e^{i(ωt - βz)}  ,\n\nwith the dispersion relation\n\n  β² = ω² - (π/a)².\n\n(b) The phase and group velocities are\n\n  vₚ = ω/β  ,  v_g = β/ω,\n\nso that v_g < 1 < vₚ (with c = 1) and\n\n  vₚv_g = 1    (or vₚv_g = c² when c is reinstated).\n\n(c) There is a cutoff frequency given by\n\n  ω_c = π/a  \n\nbelow which no wave propagates.\n\nThus, our final answer is\n\n  \\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a) } & E(x,z,t) = \\hat{y}\\,E_0\\sin\\Bigl(\\frac{\\pi x}{a}\\Bigr)e^{i\\left(\\omega t -\\beta z\\right)},\\quad \\beta^2=\\omega^2-\\Bigl(\\frac{\\pi}{a}\\Bigr)^2.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) } & v_p = \\frac{\\omega}{\\beta},\\quad v_g = \\frac{\\beta}{\\omega},\\quad v_p v_g = 1 \\quad \\text{(or } c^2\\text{ if } c\\neq1\\text{)},\\\\[1mm]\n& \\text{with } v_g < c < v_p.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c) } & \\omega_c = \\frac{\\pi}{a}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]  \n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a) } & E(x,z,t) = \\hat{y}\\,E_0\\sin\\Bigl(\\frac{\\pi x}{a}\\Bigr)e^{i\\left(\\omega t -\\beta z\\right)},\\quad \\beta^2=\\omega^2-\\Bigl(\\frac{\\pi}{a}\\Bigr)^2.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) } & v_p = \\frac{\\omega}{\\beta},\\quad v_g = \\frac{\\beta}{\\omega},\\quad v_p v_g = 1 \\quad \\text{(or } c^2\\text{ if } c\\neq1\\text{)},\\\\[1mm]\n& \\text{with } v_g < c < v_p.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c) } & \\omega_c = \\frac{\\pi}{a}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a) } & E(x,z,t) = \\hat{y}\\,E_0\\sin\\Bigl(\\frac{\\pi x}{a}\\Bigr)e^{i\\left(\\omega t -\\beta z\\right)},\\quad \\beta^2=\\omega^2-\\Bigl(\\frac{\\pi}{a}\\Bigr)^2.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) } & v_p = \\frac{\\omega}{\\beta},\\quad v_g = \\frac{\\beta}{\\omega},\\quad v_p v_g = 1 \\quad \\text{(or } c^2\\text{ if } c\\neq1\\text{)},\\\\[1mm]\n& \\text{with } v_g < c < v_p.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c) } & \\omega_c = \\frac{\\pi}{a}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\begin{aligned}\nE_x &= E_0 \\cos \\left( \\frac{n_x \\pi x}{a} \\right) \\sin \\left( \\frac{n_y \\pi y}{b} \\right) e^{i(k_z z -

So the actual magnetic dipole moment of an electron is given by\n\n  μ_e = g (–e/(2m))(ħ/2) = –(eħ)/(2m).\n\nThus, using quantum mechanics with the measured g–factor, the electron’s magnetic dipole moment is\n\n  μ_e = –(eħ)/(2m).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The gyromagnetic ratio for a thin uniform donut (ring) is\n\n  μ/L = Q/(2M).\n\n(b) For a uniformly charged spinning sphere, the gyromagnetic ratio is also\n\n  μ/L = Q/(2M).\n\n(c) For an electron with spin ħ/2 and g–factor ≈ 2, the magnetic dipole moment is\n\n  μ_e = –(eħ)/(2m).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Latex Boxed Format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\frac{\\mu}{L}=\\frac{Q}{2M},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\frac{\\mu}{L}=\\frac{Q}{2M},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\mu_e=-\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\frac{\\mu}{L}=\\frac{Q}{2M},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\frac{\\mu}{L}=\\frac{Q}{2M},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\mu_e=-\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\frac{\\mu}{L}=\\frac{Q}{2M},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\frac{\\mu}{L}=\\frac{Q}{2M},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\mu_e=-\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "g = \\frac{Q}{2M}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\frac{\\mu}{L}=\\frac{Q}{2M},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\frac{\\mu}{L}=\\frac{Q}{2M},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\mu_e=-\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "g = \\frac{Q}{2M}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Equivalently, one may obtain the pressure via the Maxwell stress tensor. (See, for example, treatments of the pressure on a conductor.) In many texts one finds that the force per unit area (pressure) on a surface with surface charge density σ is given by\n\n  p = (σ²/(2 ε₀)).\n\nWhy is this? Let us briefly review one standard derivation.\n\nStep 1. Consider a charged surface with surface charge density σ. The discontinuity of the normal component of the electric field across the surface is\n\n  E_above – E_below = σ/ε₀.\n\nSince the field produced by the surface itself is “singular” at the surface, one must take care to obtain the net force acting on a patch by averaging the field coming from “the other charges”. This procedure leads to the formula\n\n  p = (1/2) σ E_ext,\n\nwhere E_ext is the electric field produced by all charges other than those in the patch.

Motion of a Charge Released on the xy–Plane\n\nImagine now that a charge q is “released from rest” at a point in the xy–plane. (In spherical coordinates the xy–plane is given by θ = π/2.) One physical picture (suggested by the wording “as though it were a pendulum supported at the origin”) is that the particle is constrained to move on the surface of a sphere of fixed radius r = R. (This is analogous to a pendulum bob moving on a circular arc about its pivot.)\n\nIf the particle is forced (by, say, a reaction force) to remain at fixed r = R then its only coordinate is θ (we may also take φ constant since the potential is φ–independent, and the initial conditions may be chosen so that the motion lies in a principal plane).\n\nIn spherical coordinates the acceleration has two independent components. The radial and θ–components (when φ is constant) are given by\n  Radial: a_r = 𝑟¨ – r (θ̇)²,\n  Angular: a_θ = r θ¨ + 2 ṙ θ̇.\nBut if r = R is constant then ṙ = 0 and 𝑟¨ = 0 so that\n  a_r = – R (θ̇)²  and  a_θ = R θ¨.\n\nNow, the force on the charge is q𝐄. We now decompose q𝐄 into its r– and θ–components. From (2) we read off:\n  E_r = [2p cosθ]/(4πε₀ r³),  E_θ = [p sinθ]/(4πε₀ r³).\n\nThus Newton’s second law in the r and θ directions gives\n\n(3a) m (–R (θ̇)²) = q E_r = q [2p cosθ]/(4πε₀ R³),\n      or –m R (θ̇)² = [q 2p cosθ]/(4πε₀ R³).\n\n(3b) m (R θ¨) = q E_θ = q [p sinθ]/(4πε₀ R³),\n      or mR θ¨ = [q p sinθ]/(4πε₀ R³).\n\nWe now note that the particle starts at rest at θ = π/2. At that instant, we have\n  cos(π/2) = 0  and  sin(π/2) = 1.\nThus, initially, the radial force (3a) vanishes (so no “push” to leave the circle) while the tangential force (3b) is\n\n  mR θ¨ = [q p]/(4πε₀ R³).\n\nThus, if the particle is “forced” to remain at constant R, its angular equation of motion becomes\n\n  θ¨ = (q p)/(4πε₀ m R⁴) sinθ.    (4)\n\nIt is conventional to include the minus sign in the pendulum equation by a suitable definition of the coordinate (i.e. by taking the equilibrium point at the lowest potential). For example, if we define a shifted variable (say, let θ = π – ψ) with ψ = 0 at equilibrium then one obtains\n\n  ψ¨ + (q p)/(4πε₀ m R⁴) sinψ = 0,\nwhich is exactly the equation for a simple pendulum (with “gravitational” acceleration replaced by an effective acceleration g_eff = (q p)/(4πε₀ m R⁴)).\n\nThus the particle, once released, will swing back and forth along a circular (in fact, semicircular) arc about the origin, exactly as a pendulum supported at the origin swings.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThe dipole field in spherical coordinates (with 𝐩 along the z–axis) is\n\n  𝐄 = (p/(4πε₀ r³))(2 cosθ 𝐞_r + sinθ 𝐞_θ).\n\nThen, if a charge q is constrained to move on a circle of radius R (as though on a pendulum) and is released from rest at θ = π/2 (the xy–plane), its angular motion obeys\n\n  mR θ¨ = [q p sinθ]/(4πε₀ R³),\n\nor equivalently\n\n  θ¨ + (q p)/(4πε₀ m R⁴) sinθ = 0.\n\nThis is the familiar pendulum–equation, showing that the charge swings back and forth in a semicircular arc.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Boxed Format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{E} &= \\frac{p}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\, r^3}\n\\Bigl(2\\cos\\theta\\, \\hat{r} + \\sin\\theta\\, \\hat{\\theta}\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{and if } r=R\\, \\text{(constant)}\\quad mR\\,\\ddot{\\theta} &= \\frac{qp \\sin\\theta}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\, R^3}\\quad \\Longrightarrow\\quad \\ddot{\\theta}+\\frac{qp}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0m R^{4}}\\sin\\theta=0,\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nwhich is equivalent to the equation of motion for a simple pendulum.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{E} &= \\frac{p}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\, r^3}\n\\Bigl(2\\cos\\theta\\, \\hat{r} + \\sin\\theta\\, \\hat{\\theta}\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{and if } r=R\\, \\text{(constant)}\\quad mR\\,\\ddot{\\theta} &= \\frac{qp \\sin\\theta}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\, R^3}\\quad \\Longrightarrow\\quad \\ddot{\\theta}+\\frac{qp}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0m R^{4}}\\sin\\theta=0,\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{E} &= \\frac{p}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\, r^3}\n\\Bigl(2\\cos\\theta\\, \\hat{r} + \\sin\\theta\\, \\hat{\\theta}\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{and if } r=R\\, \\text{(constant)}\\quad mR\\,\\ddot{\\theta} &= \\frac{qp \\sin\\theta}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\, R^3}\\quad \\Longrightarrow\\quad \\ddot{\\theta}+\\frac{qp}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0m R^{4}}\\sin\\theta=0,\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{p}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 r^3} (2 \\cos \\theta \\mathbf{\\hat{r}} + \\sin \\theta \\mathbf{\\hat{\\theta}})"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{E} &= \\frac{p}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\, r^3}\n\\Bigl(2\\cos\\theta\\, \\hat{r} + \\sin\\theta\\, \\hat{\\theta}\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{and if } r=R\\, \\text{(constant)}\\quad mR\\,\\ddot{\\theta} &= \\frac{qp \\sin\\theta}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\, R^3}\\quad \\Longrightarrow\\quad \\ddot{\\theta}+\\frac{qp}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0m R^{4}}\\sin\\theta=0,\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\mathbf{F} = mg (2 \\cos \\theta \\mathbf{\\hat{r}} + \\sin \\theta \\mathbf{\\hat{\\theta}})"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{E} &= \\frac{p}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\, r^3}\n\\Bigl(2\\cos\\theta\\, \\hat{r} + \\sin\\theta\\, \\hat{\\theta}\\Bigr),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{and if } r=R\\, \\text{(constant)}\\quad mR\\,\\ddot{\\theta} &= \\frac{qp \\sin\\theta}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\, R^3}\\quad \\Longrightarrow\\quad \\ddot{\\theta}+\\frac{qp}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0m R^{4}}\\sin\\theta=0,\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "m = \\frac{qp}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 g r^3}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "Electricity and Magenetism/6-2", "solution": "We can understand the answer by “following” the charges into the rest‐frame of the electrons. In a conducting wire the positive charges (ions) are fixed in the laboratory frame (with density ρ₊) while the electrons move at speed v. One might think that because moving electrons attract one another, they should all contract into a thin “filament” along the axis. (This is the so‐called pinch effect.) In fact, if nothing were to oppose the attraction, the electrons would indeed move inward; however, if they did so, then in their own rest frame a net electric field would develop. In a steady state the electrons must arrange themselves so that in their rest frame there is no electric force acting on them. (For typical conduction electron speeds – very slow compared to c – the necessary rearrangement is tiny, so that the current appears uniform. In high‐temperature plasmas, however, the effect can be important.)\n\nLet us now show that this “no‐force condition” in the electrons’ rest frame leads to\n\n  ρ₋ = –γ² ρ₊      (with γ = 1/√[1 – (v/c)²]). \n\nTo do so we proceed in two steps.\n\nStep 1. Relate the densities in the electrons’ rest frame and the lab frame\n\nFor the moving electrons the charge density ρ₋ (as measured in the lab) is related to their proper (rest‐frame) density ρ₋₀ by the usual Lorentz contraction along the direction of motion. (Since the current flows along the wire, one has contraction only in that direction.) In fact, an element of electrons having rest length Δx₀ appears in the lab to have length Δx = Δx₀/γ so that\n  ρ₋ = γρ₋₀.\n(Always keep in mind that here the “density” means the number of charges per unit volume.)\n\nStep 2. Impose neutrality in the electrons’ rest frame\n\nEven though the wire in the lab is taken to be “neutral” overall – there is no electric field in the lab acting on distant charges – the moving electrons are subject to relativity. In the electrons’ rest frame, however, the ions are now moving. Their density is no longer the same as ρ₊ but must itself be Lorentz‐transformed. (Remember: When transforming to another inertial frame in which an object is moving, the length contraction increases the measured density.)\n\nSince the ions are moving in the electrons’ rest frame with speed v, their density (let us call it ρ₊′) is increased by a factor γ:\n  ρ₊′ = γρ₊.\n\nNow, if the electrons are to feel no net electric field, the total charge density in the electrons’ rest frame must vanish. That is,\n  ρ₊′ + ρ₋₀ = 0.\nSo\n  ρ₋₀ = –ρ₊′ = –γρ₊.\n\nFinally, transforming back to the lab frame (where the electron density is ρ₋ = γρ₋₀) we obtain\n  ρ₋ = γ(–γρ₊) = –γ² ρ₊.\n\nThus we have shown the required result.\n\nHow is overall neutrality restored? Notice that although in the lab frame the positive ions have density ρ₊ and the electrons appear to have density –γ²ρ₊, we must still have zero net charge when all contributions are taken into account. In our “uniform” model we have assumed a constant charge density everywhere in the cross‐section; but the above analysis shows that if the “volume” of the wire were to have the two densities ρ₊ (ions) and –γ²ρ₊ (electrons), then there is an extra negative charge in the interior. For the wire as a whole to be neutral, there must be an additional compensating positive charge which, in a real conductor, is located on its surface. (In very high–current plasmas this pinch effect can be significant; in ordinary wires v ≪ c so that γ ≈ 1 and the effect is negligible.)\n\nThus, our final answers are:\n\n1. In order for the electrons to experience no net electric force in their rest frame, the electrons must have a lab–frame density of \n  ρ₋ = –γ² ρ₊.\n2.

A “Differential Loop” Analysis\n\nImagine that you “slice” the infinite tube into thin rings (each of axial width dz). In each ring an induced electromotive force (emf) arises from the change in flux. (One may show that the flux linking a ring at “height” z relative to the magnet is given by\n\n  Φ(z) = (μ₀ μ R²)/(2 (z²+R²)^(3⁄2)).)\n\nNotice that at z = 0 (that is, in the plane perpendicular to the tube and containing the magnet) the flux is\n\n  Φ(0) = (μ₀ μ)/(2R).\n\nSince the magnet is moving downward with speed v the flux in each ring is changing at a rate\n\n  dΦ/dt = (dΦ/dz)·v.\n\nBy Faraday’s law the emf induced in the ring is\n\n  ε = –dΦ/dt = –v (dΦ/dz).\n\nNow, taking the ring to be a “short” circuit in the tube, its resistance is estimated as follows. (The current, induced in the tube, flows in the circumferential direction along the ring. Since the length of the ring is 2πR and its “cross–section” is given by t·dz we have)\n\n  R_ring = (resistivity×length)/(area) = (1/σ) (2πR)/(t dz) = 2πR/(σ t dz).\n\nThus the current in the ring is\n\n  dI = ε / R_ring = –v (dΦ/dz) · (σ t dz)/(2πR).\n\nThe power dissipated in the ring (by Joule’s law) is\n\n  dP = (dI)² R_ring\n    = v² (dΦ/dz)² (σ t dz)²/(4π²R²) · (2πR/(σ t dz))\n    = (σ t v²/(2πR)) (dΦ/dz)² dz.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Energy Balance\n\nBecause the magnet “feeds” energy into the system at a rate\n\n  P_grav = m g v\n\nand the eddy currents dissipate energy at rate\n\n  P_diss = ∫ dP = (σ t v²/(2πR)) ∫₋∞^∞ (dΦ/dz)²dz,\n\nsteady–state (terminal) motion is reached when\n\n  m g v = (σ t v²/(2πR)) ∫₋∞^∞ (dΦ/dz)²dz.\n\nCanceling one factor of v (v > 0) gives\n\n  vₜ = (2πR m g)/(σ t ∫₋∞^∞ (dΦ/dz)²dz).\n\nThus the problem is reduced to computing the “flux–gradient” integral.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Evaluating the Flux Derivative and Its Integral\n\nStart with\n\n  Φ(z) = (μ₀ μ R²)/(2 (z²+R²)^(3⁄2)).\n\nDifferentiate with respect to z:\n\n  dΦ/dz = d/dz [ (μ₀ μ R²)/(2) (z²+R²)^(–3⁄2) ]\n     = – (3 μ₀ μ R² z)/(2 (z²+R²)^(5⁄2)).\n\nThus\n\n  (dΦ/dz)² = (9 μ₀² μ² R⁴ z²)/(4 (z²+R²)⁵).\n\nWe must now evaluate\n\n  I = ∫₋∞^∞ (dΦ/dz)²dz = (9 μ₀² μ² R⁴)/(4) ∫₋∞^∞ z²/(z²+R²)⁵ dz.\n\nChange variables: Let x = z/R so that dz = R dx. Then\n\n  I = (9 μ₀² μ² R⁴)/(4) ∫₋∞^∞ (R² x²)/(R^10 (1+x²)⁵) R dx\n    = (9 μ₀² μ²)/(4 R³) ∫₋∞^∞ x²/(1+x²)⁵ dx.\n\nFortunately, we are told that\n\n  ∫₋∞^∞ x²/(1+x²)⁵ dx = 5π/128.\n\nThus\n\n  I = (9 μ₀² μ²)/(4 R³) · (5π/128) = (45π μ₀² μ²)/(512 R³).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 5. Writing the Final Expression\n\nRecall we had\n\n  vₜ = (2πR m g)/(σ t · I).\n\nSubstitute I:\n\n  vₜ = (2πR m g)/(σ t (45π μ₀² μ²/(512 R³)))\n    = (2πR m g · 512 R³)/(σ t 45π μ₀² μ²)\n    = (1024 m g R⁴)/(45 σ t μ₀² μ²).\n\nThis is our final result.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThus, the terminal velocity of the dipole is\n\n  vₜ = (1024 m g R⁴)/(45 σ t μ₀² μ²).\n\nIn boxed LaTeX we write:\n\n  \\[\n  \\boxed{ v_\\text{T} = \\frac{1024\\,m\\,g\\,R^4}{45\\,\\sigma\\,t\\,\\mu_0^2\\,\\mu^2} }\n  \\]\n\nThis answer – though not unique in appearance – is entirely acceptable.
