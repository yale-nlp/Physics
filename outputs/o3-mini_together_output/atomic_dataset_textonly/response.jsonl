{"id": "atomic/1-41", "solution": "We shall analyze each case by writing down the effective spin‐Hamiltonian and then evaluating its eigenenergies. In both cases the hyperfine (or “spin–spin”) interaction takes the form\n\n  H = (constant) × (spin–dot–spin).\n\nThe eigenvalues then depend on the total spin formed by coupling the two constituents.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nPart (a): Hyperfine splitting in the hydrogen atom\n\nThe ground state of the hydrogen atom contains an electron (spin S = ½) and a proton (spin I = ½). Their hyperfine interaction is given by the Fermi contact term\n\n  H_hfs = A (I · S).\n\nWe may conveniently rewrite I · S in terms of the total angular momentum F = I + S. In general,\n  I · S = ½ [F² – I² – S²].\n\nSince I = S = ½ we have\n  I² = S² = ¾  and  F² = F(F + 1)\nwith F taking the values F = 1 (triplet) and F = 0 (singlet).\n\nNow, calculate the expectation values:\n1. For F = 1:\n  I · S = ½ [1(1 + 1) – ¾ – ¾] = ½ [2 – 1.5] = ½ (0.5) = +0.25.\n  Thus, E(F = 1) = A·(+0.25).\n\n2. For F = 0:\n  I · S = ½ [0(0 + 1) – ¾ – ¾] = ½ [0 – 1.5] = –0.75.\n  Thus, E(F = 0) = A·(–0.75).\n\nIf the hyperfine constant A is positive (as it is for atomic hydrogen), we see that\n  E(F = 0) < E(F = 1).\n\nIn a level diagram these appear as:\n\n         ↑ Higher Energy\n       -----------------  F = 1 (triplet)\n       -----------------  F = 0 (singlet)\n         ↓ Lower Energy\n\nThus the electron–proton pair with parallel spins (F = 1) lies higher in energy than that with antiparallel spins (F = 0). The energy difference is\n\n  ΔE = E(F = 1) – E(F = 0) = A.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nPart (b): Splitting in the hydrogen molecule (H₂)\n\nFor the H₂ molecule the electrons form a singlet state (bonding orbital) and thus the electronic part is symmetric. The two protons (each with spin I = ½) can combine to form either a triplet (total nuclear spin I_N = 1, “ortho‐hydrogen”) or a singlet state (I_N = 0, “para‐hydrogen”). There exists an effective interaction between the nuclear magnetic moments (sometimes referred to as an indirect or J‐coupling mediated by the electrons) of the form\n\n  H = J (I₁ · I₂).\n\nUsing again the identity\n  I₁ · I₂ = ½ [I_N² – I₁² – I₂²],\nand noting that I₁² = I₂² = ¾, we obtain:\n\n1. For nuclear triplet (I_N = 1):\n  I₁ · I₂ = ½ [1(1 + 1) – ¾ – ¾] = ½ [2 – 1.5] = +0.25.\n  Energy: E(triplet) = J·0.25.\n\n2. For nuclear singlet (I_N = 0):\n  I₁ · I₂ = ½ [0(0 + 1) – ¾ – ¾] = ½ (–1.5) = –0.75.\n  Energy: E(singlet) = J·(–0.75).\n\nIf the coupling constant J is positive (as is typically the case), then the singlet state has lower energy and the triplet state is higher by an amount ΔE given by\n\n  ΔE = E(triplet) – E(singlet) = J (0.25 – (–0.75)) = J.\n\nThus, in H₂ the nuclear spin triplet (ortho‐hydrogen) is higher in energy than the nuclear spin singlet (para‐hydrogen).\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer\n\n(a) In the hydrogen atom ground state the hyperfine Hamiltonian H = A (I · S) gives energies E(F = 1) = +A/4 for the triplet (parallel spins) and E(F = 0) = –3A/4 for the singlet (antiparallel spins). Thus, the triplet F = 1 state lies at a higher energy.\n\n(b) In the hydrogen molecule, using the effective nuclear spin–spin interaction H = J (I₁ · I₂), one finds energies E(I_N = 1) = +J/4 for the triplet (ortho‐hydrogen) and E(I_N = 0) = –3J/4 for the singlet (para‐hydrogen). Therefore, the nuclear spin triplet state is higher in energy.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{(a) The F = 1 (triplet) state lies higher than the F = 0 (singlet) state. \\quad (b) The nuclear spin triplet (ortho) state lies higher than the singlet (para) state.}} \\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{(a) The F = 1 (triplet) state lies higher than the F = 0 (singlet) state. \\quad (b) The nuclear spin triplet (ortho) state lies higher than the singlet (para) state.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{(a) The F = 1 (triplet) state lies higher than the F = 0 (singlet) state. \\quad (b) The nuclear spin triplet (ortho) state lies higher than the singlet (para) state.}", "expr2": "\\text{triplet } F = 1 \\text{ is an excited state and singlet } F = 0 \\text{ is the ground state}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "atomic/2-35", "solution": "We will treat each part step‐by‐step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPart (a): Why heavy nuclei are α‐radioactive but stable against neutron emission\n\n1. Energy Considerations.  \n • In heavy nuclei the total binding energy per nucleon is high, but the competing effects of the strong nuclear force (a short‐range attractive force) and the long‐range Coulomb repulsion (between many protons) conspires so that the overall binding of an α–particle cluster (two protons and two neutrons) is relatively high. This cluster is “preformed” inside the nucleus with a binding energy near that of a free α–particle.  \n • Thus if the energy (Q–value) produced by the decay into the daughter nucleus and an α–particle is positive, then the α–decay can proceed by quantum tunneling through the Coulomb barrier.  \n\n2. Neutron–Emission Stability.  \n • A single neutron, in contrast, does not experience Coulomb repulsion and its “barrier” is only the overall depth of the nuclear potential well.  \n • In heavy nuclei, the neutron separation energy (the amount of energy needed to remove a neutron) is generally positive (i.e. the neutron is bound). If the separation energy were negative (unstable with respect to neutron emission) the decay would proceed “promptly” because there is no Coulomb barrier.  \n • That neutron emission does not occur means that although the nucleus is “uncomfortable” (excess Coulomb energy) and can tunnel out an α–cluster (where the Q–value exceeds the energy required to overcome the Coulomb barrier via tunneling), the removal of a single neutron does not lower the total energy enough to allow spontaneous emission.\n\nThus, heavy nuclei can “afford” to emit an α–particle (which releases more energy by converting a tightly bound cluster into a free α–particle) while leaving behind a daughter with lower Coulomb repulsion, whereas neutron emission is energetically unfavourable.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPart (b): Methods and Arguments to Determine Nuclear Radii\n\nSeveral independent methods have been developed:\n\n1. Electron Scattering.  \n • High–energy electrons are scattered off nuclei. The measured diffraction (form-factor) pattern depends on the charge distribution, from which a charge radius can be deduced.  \n • This method is model–independent and gives a precise value for the “charge radius” of the nucleus.\n\n2. Proton and Hadron Scattering.  \n • Elastic scattering of protons (or other hadrons) also probes the nuclear matter distribution. The analysis of scattering angles and differential cross sections yields an estimate of the nuclear “matter radius.”\n\n3. Muonic Atom Spectroscopy.  \n • When a muon (heavier than an electron) is captured in an atomic orbit, its wavefunction extends deeply into the nuclear region. X–ray transition energies in such muonic atoms are very sensitive to the nuclear charge distribution and thus give precise nuclear radii.\n\n4. Empirical Systematics.  \n • The simple formula R = R₀A^(1/3) (with R₀ ≃ 1.2–1.3 fm) is well supported by experimental data. This scaling results from the approximately constant nuclear density.\n\nThus, a combination of scattering experiments, spectroscopy (especially of muonic atoms) and global systematics provides our understanding of nuclear sizes.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPart (c): Properties that Identify a System of Nucleons in its Lowest Energy State; Nonclassical Properties\n\nA system of nucleons in its ground state is characterized by:\n\n1. Discrete Energy Levels and Shell Structure.  \n • Nucleons occupy quantized energy levels governed by a nuclear mean–field potential (as in the shell model).  \n • The arrangement of these levels leads to “magic numbers” where extra binding (and stability) is observed.\n\n2. Quantum Numbers.  \n • The minimum energy configuration is identified by its total angular momentum, parity, isospin, etc.  \n • Pauli’s exclusion principle forces nucleons into higher orbits even if they would be classically expected to “fall” into the deepest part of a potential.\n\n3. Pairing Effects.  \n • Nucleons tend to pair (particularly like–nucleons) which provides extra binding (pairing energy) and leads to an even–odd effect in nuclear properties.\n • This phenomenon is purely quantum–mechanical in origin.\n\n4. Collective Effects.  \n • In many nuclei, especially those away from closed–shell configurations, collective motions (such as rotational and vibrational states) emerge whose quantized nature has no classical analogue.\n • Superfluidity (or nuclear pairing correlations resulting in a superconducting character of the nuclear fluid) is a nonclassical property of the ground state.\n\nThus the lowest energy state (ground state) shows many nonclassical features such as a quantized shell structure, pairing correlations, and collective excitations, none of which can be explained by classical physics.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPart (d): Explaining the Variation of Fission Cross Sections in Thermal vs. Fast Neutron Induced Fission\n\nLet us note the main observations:\n • For thermal neutrons (low energy), the fission cross section for uranium isotopes shows a strong sensitivity to the nuclear structure. In the table, isotopes with odd–number of neutrons (e.g. 231U, 233U, 235U) have large fission cross sections, whereas some even–even nuclei (e.g. 234U and 236U) have negligible cross section.\n • For fast neutrons (high energy), the fission cross sections are nearly all of the order of a few barns and the pronounced even–odd periodicity disappears.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Thermal Neutron Fission.  \n • At low (thermal) energies, the formation of a compound nucleus is strongly influenced by nuclear structure details.  \n • Pairing effects (a nonclassical phenomenon) in even–even nuclei tend to increase the fission barrier because paired nucleons generate extra binding. Therefore, even–even isotopes can have high fission barriers making them less sensitive to the low excess energy provided by a thermal neutron.  \n • Odd–mass isotopes (with an unpaired nucleon) may have lower effective fission barriers, enhancing the probability of fission, hence the large fission cross sections observed.\n • In addition, resonances in the compound nucleus (which occur at low energy) can enhance the cross section for isotopes with favorable level structure.\n\n2. Fast Neutron Fission.  \n • With fast neutrons, the excitation energy imparted is large enough that the detailed pairing and shell effects are “washed out.”  \n • The compound nucleus is formed at a high excitation energy; thus, the fission barrier is effectively overcome irrespective of subtle differences in nuclear structure arising from the pairing interaction.\n • Therefore, the fission cross sections become relatively small and similar (only a few barns) across different isotopes, with the even–odd effects being much less pronounced.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Summary\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\textbf{(a)}\\quad \\text{Heavy nuclei are } \\alpha\\text{–radioactive because a preformed } \\alpha\\text{–cluster (a very tightly bound quartet of nucleons) }\\\\\n\\quad \\text{can tunnel through the Coulomb barrier when the } Q\\text{–value is positive.

{"id": "atomic/1-12", "solution": "We will show that when a single‐electron atom (ignoring spin) in a central potential is placed in the external weak potential\n\n  V₍pert₎ = A x² + B y² – (A + B)z²\n\nthe l = 1 (degenerate) level (with basis functions proportional to x, y, z multiplied by a common radial function f(r)) splits into three levels with shifts proportional to A, B, and –(A+B) respectively. In addition, for each one the expectation value of L_z vanishes.\n\nLet us work through the steps.\n\n———————————————————————————————\nStep 1. Write the unperturbed l = 1 wave functions\n\nSince the angular part for l = 1 is three‐fold degenerate we can choose a convenient real basis,\n  ψₓ(r) = x f(r),\n  ψ_y(r) = y f(r),\n  ψ_z(r) = z f(r).\nHere f(r) is the (common) radial function (which we will assume is properly normalized together with the x, y, and z factors).\n\n———————————————————————————————\nStep 2. Evaluate the matrix elements of V₍pert₎\n\nIn first‐order perturbation theory the energy shift for a state ψ is\n  ΔE = ⟨ψ | V₍pert₎ | ψ⟩.\nFor our wave functions we need to evaluate integrals of the form\n  I₍α²₎ := ∫ d³r [α f(r)]² (α²),\nwhere α represents x, y or z. Because f(r) is spherically symmetric the angular integrals imply that\n  ⟨x²⟩ = ⟨y²⟩ = ⟨z²⟩ ≡ J,\nwith J a common positive constant. (More precisely, one finds J = (1/3)⟨r²⟩ for the appropriate normalized f(r).) Also, the cross‐terms like ∫ d³r f(r)² x² y² vanish if they connect different basis states (or vanish by symmetry).\n\nThus the energy shift for a ψ = (α x + β y + γ z) f(r) is\n  ΔE = A α² J + B β² J – (A + B)γ² J.\nIn the special cases where the eigenfunction is one of our basis functions we get:\n • For ψₓ(r) = x f(r): Here α = 1 and β = γ = 0 so that\n  ΔEₓ = A J.\n • For ψ_y(r) = y f(r): Here β = 1 so that\n  ΔE_y = B J.\n • For ψ_z(r) = z f(r): Here γ = 1 so that\n  ΔE_z = – (A + B) J.\nSince J is a common, positive factor we often quote only the relative factors of A, B, and –(A + B).\n\nThus the splitting of the l = 1 level is into three levels (up to an overall multiplicative factor J):\n  ΔEₓ ∝ A, ΔE_y ∝ B, ΔE_z ∝ –(A+B).\n\nA sketch of the energy level diagram would show three levels with these relative energy shifts.\n\n———————————————————————————————\nStep 3. Expectation value of L_z in each eigenstate\n\nThe z component of angular momentum is given by\n  L_z = –iħ (x∂ᵧ – y∂ₓ).\nNotice that the eigenfunctions we have chosen (namely, x f(r), y f(r), and z f(r)) are all real. One may show that if a state is real, then for an operator that is purely imaginary (as L_z is) the expectation value vanishes. (You can also check explicitly that for ψₓ(r) = x f(r):\n  ⟨L_z⟩ = ∫ d³r [x f(r)] (–iħ (x∂ᵧ – y∂ₓ))[x f(r)]\n      = 0,\nfor essentially the same reason that cross‐terms in the integrals vanish by symmetry.)\nThus, for each of our eigenfunctions (which are the energy eigenstates to first order) one obtains\n  ⟨L_z⟩ = 0.\n\nNote: One might also choose to form complex combinations so that the states are eigenstates of L_z (namely Y₁,±₁ and Y₁,0). However, our chosen eigenfunctions are the ones that diagonalize the perturbation V₍pert₎ since the potential is given in Cartesian coordinates; and in these states, the expectation value of L_z remains zero.\n\n———————————————————————————————\nFinal Answer\n\n(a) The l = 1 level splits into three levels with first‐order energy shifts (up to a common positive factor J) given by\n  ΔEₓ ∝ A  (for ψₓ = x f(r)),\n  ΔE_y ∝ B  (for ψ_y = y f(r)),\n  ΔE_z ∝ –(A+B)  (for ψ_z = z f(r)).\nA sketch of the energy diagram would have these three levels at heights proportional to A, B, and –(A+B).\n\n(b) The expectation value of L_z in each level is zero; that is,\n  ⟨L_z⟩ = 0 for each eigenstate.\n\n———————————————————————————————\nFinal Answer in Latex Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\Delta E_x = A\\,J,\\quad \\Delta E_y = B\\,J,\\quad \n\\Delta E_z = - (A+B)\\,J,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\langle L_z\\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{for each level.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\Delta E_x = A\\,J,\\quad \\Delta E_y = B\\,J,\\quad \n\\Delta E_z = - (A+B)\\,J,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\langle L_z\\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{for each level.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\Delta E_x = A\\,J,\\quad \\Delta E_y = B\\,J,\\quad \n\\Delta E_z = - (A+B)\\,J,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\langle L_z\\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{for each level.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "E_2 - 12(A + B)a^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\Delta E_x = A\\,J,\\quad \\Delta E_y = B\\,J,\\quad \n\\Delta E_z = - (A+B)\\,J,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\langle L_z\\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{for each level.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "E_2 + \\frac{3}{2}(3A + 5B)a^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\Delta E_x = A\\,J,\\quad \\Delta E_y = B\\,J,\\quad \n\\Delta E_z = - (A+B)\\,J,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\langle L_z\\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{for each level.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "E_2 + \\frac{3}{2}(5A + 3B)a^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\Delta E_x = A\\,J,\\quad \\Delta E_y = B\\,J,\\quad \n\\Delta E_z = - (A+B)\\,J,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\langle L_z\\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{for each level.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\langle L_z \\rangle = 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-15", "solution": "We begin by noting that the Stern–Gerlach (SG) device used here is sensitive only to the z–component of the magnetic moment (or spin). That is, it “measures” μz (or S₍z₎), and its inhomogeneous field deflects the particles upward if μz is positive and downward if μz is negative. However, depending on the initial polarization of the beam, the beam entering the SG magnet may already be an eigenstate of S₍z₎ or a non‐eigenstate (i.e. a coherent superposition) when expressed in the S₍z₎ basis.\n\nLet’s analyze the four cases step by step.\n\n────────────────────────────\nPart (a): Pattern of Splitting\n\n(1) Case (i): Beam polarized along +z direction\n\nA beam prepared in the spin state |+z⟩ is an eigenstate of S₍z₎ with eigenvalue +ħ/2. When such a beam enters the SG apparatus, every particle has μz positive, and the force (which is proportional to μz) acts in one direction (say, upward). Therefore, the beam is not split at all; only a single beam appears.\n\n────────────────────────────\n(2) Case (ii): Beam polarized along +x direction\n\nRecall that the state polarized along the x–axis is given by\n  |+x⟩ = (1/√2)[|+z⟩ + |–z⟩].\n\nIn this superposition, the coefficients for |+z⟩ and |–z⟩ have equal magnitude. Therefore, when a beam in this state enters the SG apparatus (which “measures” S₍z₎), each particle is found with 50% probability to be in the |+z⟩ state and 50% probability to be in the |–z⟩ state. Consequently, the beam splits into two beams of equal intensity—one deflected upward (μz positive) and one deflected downward (μz negative).\n\n────────────────────────────\n(3) Case (iii): Beam polarized along +y direction\n\nSimilarly, the state polarized along +y is written in the S₍z₎ basis as\n  |+y⟩ = (1/√2)[|+z⟩ + i|–z⟩].\n\nAgain, the absolute values of the coefficients for |+z⟩ and |–z⟩ are equal. Thus, an SG apparatus that measures S₍z₎ will also yield a 50/50 split into an upward beam and a downward beam.\n\n────────────────────────────\n(4) Case (iv): Beam unpolarized\n\nAn “unpolarized” beam is a statistical mixture in which half the particles are in the state |+z⟩ and half in |–z⟩, with no phase relationship between them. The SG apparatus will simply separate these two populations. Hence, one obtains two beams of equal intensity, one corresponding to μz positive and the other to μz negative.\n\n────────────────────────────\nSummary of (a):\n\n• (i) +z polarized: single (upward) beam.  \n• (ii) +x polarized: two beams (upward and downward) in equal intensities.  \n• (iii) +y polarized: two beams (upward and downward) in equal intensities.  \n• (iv) Unpolarized: two beams (upward and downward) in equal intensities.\n\n────────────────────────────\nPart (b): Distinguishing the Cases with 50/50 Splitting\n\nThe cases (ii), (iii), and (iv) all produce a 50/50 splitting in the z–direction. However, they differ in the quantum mechanical information contained in the beam:\n\n• In cases (ii) and (iii) the beam is in a coherent superposition of |+z⟩ and |–z⟩ (with relative phases 0 and π/2 respectively).  \n• In case (iv) the beam is an incoherent (random) mixture of |+z⟩ and |–z⟩.\n\nOne can design a further experiment to reveal these differences. Here are two approaches:\n\n1. Using a Second SG Apparatus Oriented Along Another Axis\n\n a. For instance, after the first SG apparatus (which splits the beam along z), recombine the two split beams coherently (i.e. without destroying the phase relation). Then send the recombined beam into a second SG apparatus oriented along the x–axis (or y–axis).\n\n b. If the original beam was prepared in the pure state |+x⟩, the recombined beam will still carry the coherence needed to yield a deterministic outcome (namely, all particles emerging in the “+x” channel). In contrast, if the state is an incoherent mixture (unpolarized) or a different pure state (like |+y⟩), the result of a subsequent x–measurement will be probabilistic. (For example, the |+y⟩ state, when expressed in the x–basis, is again an equal-amplitude superposition, and the incoherent mixture cannot yield a definite result.)\n \n2. Interference Experiments\n\n a. One may try to recombine the two spatially separated beams (from the SG apparatus) interferometrically. Only when the two beams are in a coherent superposition (as in cases (ii) and (iii)) can well‐defined interference fringes be observed.  \n b. An incoherent mixture (case (iv)) will not produce interference fringes because the relative phase between the |+z⟩ and |–z⟩ components is random.\n\nThus, by selecting an appropriate second measurement—either with another SG apparatus oriented along a different direction or by setting up an interference experiment that recombines the split beams—one can discriminate between a pure state (which has a definite phase between |+z⟩ and |–z⟩ components) and an unpolarized or incoherent state.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n(a) \n (i) A beam polarized along +z gives one deflected (e.g. upward) beam (since it is an eigenstate of S₍z₎).  \n (ii) A beam polarized along +x (|+x⟩ = (1/√2)[|+z⟩ + |–z⟩]) splits into two beams of equal intensity (one upward, one downward).  \n (iii) A beam polarized along +y (|+y⟩ = (1/√2)[|+z⟩ + i|–z⟩]) also splits equally into two beams.  \n (iv) An unpolarized beam (an equal incoherent mixture of |+z⟩ and |–z⟩) yields a 50/50 split into two beams.\n\n(b) Although cases (ii), (iii), and (iv) all yield a 50/50 split when measuring S₍z₎, they differ in coherence (the pure states |+x⟩ and |+y⟩ have definite phase relationships between |+z⟩ and |–z⟩ components, unlike an incoherent mixture). One can distinguish them by, for example, recombining the two z–split beams (using suitable magnetic fields that preserve phase) and then performing a subsequent measurement along a different direction (e.g. the x– or y–axis) or setting up an interference experiment. For a coherent state (like |+x⟩), the subsequent measurement will yield a definite result (say, all particles in the +x channel), while an incoherent mixture will still give a probabilistic (50/50) result. Such additional experiments can thus differentiate between pure states polarized along differing directions and an unpolarized beam.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Latex\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) } \\\\\n\\quad \\text{(i) A beam polarized along } +z \\text{ is deflected as a single beam (all particles have } \\mu_z > 0\\text{).} \\\\\n\\quad \\text{(ii) A beam polarized along } +x \\text{ (with } |+x\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\,|+z\\rangle+|-z\\rangle]\\text{) splits into two beams equally,} \\\\\n\\quad \\quad \\text{one deflected upward and one downward.} \\\\\n\\quad \\text{(iii) A beam polarized along } +y \\text{ (with } |+y\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\,|+z\\rangle+i|-z\\rangle]\\text{) also splits into two equal beams.} \\\\\n\\quad \\text{(iv) An unpolarized beam (an equal mixture of } |+z\\rangle \\text{ and } |-z\\rangle) \\text{ yields a 50/50 split.} \\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) Although (ii), (iii), and (iv) produce identical splitting in a S}_{z}\\text{ measurement,} \\\\\n\\quad \\text{the pure states in (ii) and (iii) have coherent phase relationships (i.e., are coherent superpositions)} \\\\\n\\quad \\text{while (iv) is an incoherent mixture.

{"id": "atomic/2-32", "solution": "We begin by noting that the strong (nuclear) force is assumed to be identical for all nucleon–nucleon pairs. That is, if we “turn off” all other ingredients, a proton–proton, neutron–neutron, or proton–neutron pair would interact exactly the same way. In nature, however, there are two other important ingredients in nuclei:\n\n1. There is a repulsive Coulomb force between protons.\n2. There is an “asymmetry” or “Pauli” effect that favors having roughly equal numbers of neutrons and protons when other effects are balanced.\n\nLet’s now explain the two parts of the question step by step.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 1. Why are light nuclei nearly equal mixtures of protons and neutrons?\n\nFor relatively light nuclei the number of protons is small so that the Coulomb repulsion among them is weak. In this situation, the dominant attractive interaction is the strong force, which (by our assumption) is identical for proton–proton (aside from Coulomb corrections), neutron–neutron, and proton–neutron pairs. In addition, the Pauli exclusion principle and the energy cost associated with imbalance (the asymmetry energy in the liquid drop picture) favor nearly equal numbers of neutrons and protons. Thus, both the energetics of the strong force and the asymmetry energy naturally lead to nearly equal numbers of protons and neutrons.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 2. Why do heavy nuclei have many more neutrons than protons?\n\nIn heavy nuclei the number of protons becomes large, and the repulsive Coulomb force (which acts only between protons) becomes very significant. If there were as many protons as neutrons, the repulsive Coulomb energy would destabilize the nucleus enormously. The remedy is to “dilute” the protons by adding extra neutrons. Neutrons interact just as strongly as protons via the nuclear force but do not contribute to the Coulomb repulsion. In this way the extra neutrons help to hold the nucleus together by increasing the overall attractive (nuclear) binding without making the Coulomb repulsion worse. Minimizing the total energy of the nucleus thus requires a notable excess of neutrons in heavy nuclei.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 3. Why is the energy needed to remove a proton (the “separation energy”) roughly the same as that needed to remove a neutron in light nuclei, yet higher for a proton than for a neutron in heavy nuclei?\n\nIn a light nucleus the Coulomb energy is small. Thus, when you remove a nucleon, whether it is a proton or a neutron, you lose almost the same amount of attractive nuclear binding. (There is almost no extra energy associated with the Coulomb force.) Therefore, the energy required to “unbind” either species is roughly the same.\n\nIn a heavy nucleus the situation is different. First, stable heavy nuclei “choose” to have more neutrons so that the remaining protons are fewer and the overall Coulomb repulsion is reduced. Even so, the individual protons “feel” a strong repulsive barrier at the edge of the nucleus (the Coulomb barrier). Although it might seem that the Coulomb repulsion would make it easier to remove a proton, the situation is subtle because the overall binding energy (as determined by the balance of all energy terms in the nucleus) is such that protons occupy lower (more deeply bound) energy levels in the optimum (stable) configuration. In effect, the nucleus arranges itself so that the binding “loss” when a proton is removed is slightly larger than when a neutron is removed. (Also, when you remove a proton you affect the Coulomb energy in the remaining nucleus, and the changes in the asymmetry energy further favor a neutron-rich configuration.) Moreover, a proton escaping from a heavy nucleus must overcome the Coulomb barrier on its way out, so that, dynamically speaking, it is “harder” to remove even if the binding energies are close.\n\nThus, the extra Coulomb effects in heavy nuclei not only force the nucleus to be neutron-rich but also result in a situation in which the effective “separation energy” for a proton is higher than that for a neutron.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer\n\nFor light nuclei, with few protons, the Coulomb repulsion is negligible and the nuclear force (being charge‐independent) binds protons and neutrons equally, so stable nuclei have nearly equal numbers and the energy to remove either type is about the same. In heavy nuclei, by contrast, the large proton–proton Coulomb repulsion forces the nucleus to be neutron rich (to maximize binding while minimizing repulsion), and the extra Coulomb barrier makes it energetically more costly to remove a proton than a neutron.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{For light nuclei, negligible Coulomb repulsion leads to nearly equal binding energies for neutrons and protons.

(Since both 2S and 1S have even parity, the dipole matrix element between them would vanish.) Instead, the 2S state decays via a two‑photon process, which is of higher order.\n\nHowever, if small parity‐violating forces mix in a little bit of the 2P state (l = 1, odd parity) with coefficient ε, the state can be written as\n\n  Ψ(n = 2, j = 1/2) = Ψ_s(n = 2, j = 1/2, l = 0) + ε Ψ_p(n = 2, j = 1/2, l = 1).\n\nNow the 2P component has the proper parity to connect to the 1S state by an E1 transition.

{"id": "atomic/2-33", "solution": "We begin by noting that a heavy nucleus can lower its energy and become more stable by emitting a cluster of nucleons. Experiments show that the emission of an α–particle (a helium-4 nucleus) is by far the most common process: why is that the case?\n\nStep 1. Energy Release (Q–value):\n\n(a) In an α–decay process the energy (Q–value) released is comparatively large. This is because the α–particle has an exceptionally high binding energy per nucleon (approximately 7 MeV per nucleon), so that when it is separated from the parent nucleus, the difference in binding energy (between the parent nucleus and the daughter plus the α–particle) is significant. In other words, the formation of a very strongly bound α–particle yields a larger Q–value compared to the emission of a proton, deuteron, or triton, whose binding energies are lower and where the rearrangements of nucleons in the daughter nucleus are less favorable. For fission, although energy is released, the division of the nucleus into two heavy fragments tends not to have as large a Q–value per nucleon as the formation of the α particle. Thus, the net energy benefit is maximized in α–decay.\n\nStep 2. Coulomb Barrier:\n\n(b) The emitted charged particle must tunnel through the Coulomb barrier created by the repulsion between the positively-charged fragment and the daughter nucleus. For α–decay, the combination of moderate charge (Z = 2) and the short range (small radius) of the tightly bound α–particle mean that the effective Coulomb barrier that must be overcome is relatively “thin” compared to what would be faced by, say, fission (in which the two large fragments repel each other very strongly) or even proton–emission where the energy release is typically lower. While one might think that a single proton (Z = 1) would have an easier time tunneling, the energetics are not in its favor: the Q–value for proton emission is usually much smaller – and there is generally not a favorable preformation of an isolated proton in the nuclear medium (in contrast to the preformation of an α–cluster). In addition, emission of heavier clusters like deuterons or tritons is disfavored both because they are less strongly bound than an α–particle and because their effective tunneling barrier (owing to their larger mass and charge distribution) turns out to be less amenable to tunneling.\n\nHence, in summary:\n\n• (a) The energy release is high for α–decay because an α–particle is a very stable, tightly bound cluster. This large Q–value makes the process exothermic and energetically favorable.\n\n• (b) The Coulomb barrier to be penetrated is effectively lower for an α–particle than for the breakup processes leading to the emission of a proton, deuteron, or triton, or for the large-scale rearrangement required for fission. Also, the high pre-formation probability of the α–cluster within the nucleus improves the tunneling probability, making the decay much more likely.\n\nThus, both the energetics (greater Q–value) and the tunneling probability (due to a relatively lower Coulomb barrier and higher cluster preformation probability) favor α–decay over other possible modes.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Alpha decay is favored because the tightly bound alpha particle release a large energy (high Q-value) and, despite its charge, it must tunnel through a relatively thinner Coulomb barrier compared to the alternatives (individual protons, deuterons, tritons, or larger fragments from fission).}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Alpha decay is favored because the tightly bound alpha particle release a large energy (high Q-value) and, despite its charge, it must tunnel through a relatively thinner Coulomb barrier compared to the alternatives (individual protons, deuterons, tritons, or larger fragments from fission).}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Alpha decay is favored because the tightly bound alpha particle release a large energy (high Q-value) and, despite its charge, it must tunnel through a relatively thinner Coulomb barrier compared to the alternatives (individual protons, deuterons, tritons, or larger fragments from fission).}", "expr2": "\\text{Energy release factor: }\\alpha\\text{-decay energies } > 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Alpha decay is favored because the tightly bound alpha particle release a large energy (high Q-value) and, despite its charge, it must tunnel through a relatively thinner Coulomb barrier compared to the alternatives (individual protons, deuterons, tritons, or larger fragments from fission).}", "expr2": "\\text{Coulomb barrier factor: }\\mathcal{G}\\text{ for fission is larger, } \\text{lower probability of penetration compared to } \\alpha\\text{-decay}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "atomic/2-34", "solution": "We can understand the striking difference between α–radioactivity and proton–radioactivity by looking at the energetics and barrier–penetration probabilities in a quantitative way.\n\nStep 1. The Role of Q–values\n\nFor an unstable nucleus to emit a particle, the process must be energetically allowed; in other words, the Q–value must be positive. In heavy nuclei (say, around A ≈ 210–250) the Q–value for α–emission is typically in the range of about 4–9 MeV. In contrast, the one–proton separation energy for heavy nuclei is usually positive (of order 5–10 MeV) so that the nucleus is bound with respect to proton emission. (Only when a nucleus lies beyond the proton–drip line does Q_p become positive, and such nuclei occur among much lighter, highly proton–rich species.) Thus, for heavy nuclei the energy release in removing an α–particle (which is “preformed” in the nucleus, see next step) is much more favorable than that for removing a single proton.\n\nStep 2. Preformation Factors: Coherence of the α–Particle\n\nThe α–particle is a very strongly bound cluster (its binding energy is about 28 MeV for 4 nucleons) and there is evidence that in many heavy nuclei an α–cluster is “preformed” inside the parent nucleus. This means that the nucleus “prefers” to group two protons and two neutrons together, reducing the effective barrier width for the tunnelling process. By contrast, the emission of a single proton must remove an individual nucleon from the Fermi sea where no special preformation occurs. So even if energetically allowed, the probability (preformation factor) for a single proton to “pop out” is very small.\n\nStep 3. Tunnelling Through the Coulomb Barrier\n\nOnce the particle to be emitted is “preformed”, its escape from the nucleus is hindered by the Coulomb barrier. The tunnelling probability, T, may be estimated (in a very simplified picture) as \n  T ~ exp(–2G),\nwith the Gamow factor G given approximately by\n\n  G = (2/ħ)√(2μ) ∫₍r₁₎^(r₂) √(V(r) – Q) dr.\n\nHere μ is the reduced mass, and V(r) is the Coulomb potential. For a charged particle the dominant part of V(r) is the Coulomb repulsion. The important parameters are the product of charges Z₁Z₂ and the available decay energy Q. For α–decay the product is (2·Z_d) where Z_d is the charge of the daughter nucleus, while for proton emission it is just (1·Z_d).\n\nNow, although the Coulomb barrier height for an α–particle is higher than that for a single proton – roughly estimated by taking the Coulomb potential at the nuclear surface using\n\n  V_C ≈ (Z_particle Z_d e²) / R  ,\n\nwith R ≈ 1.2 A^(1/3) fm, so that for a heavy nucleus (say, A ≈ 210, R ≈ 7 fm) we have:\n  V_C(α) ≈ (2 Z_d e²) / R  and  V_C(p) ≈ (1 Z_d e²) / R;\nthe crucial point is that the α–emission Q–value is typically several MeV larger than what would be available for proton emission from heavy nuclei (which typically are not proton–unbound). Moreover, when one writes the Gamow exponent approximately, one finds that it depends roughly as\n\n  G ~ (Z_particle Z_d) / √Q.\n\nFor α–decay this factor is roughly G₍α₎ ∝ (2Z_d)/√Q_α, for proton–decay G_p ∝ (Z_d)/√Q_p. Even though the factor 2 in the numerator makes the Coulomb barrier “taller” for the α–particle, the fact that Q_α is appreciable (say, Q_α ~5 MeV) and that the α–particle is preformed (so that the effective mass parameter is that of the 4–nucleon system) means that the exponential tunnelling probability is not extremely small. In contrast, for the proton the Q–value in heavy nuclei is normally negative (or if barely positive, maybe only a few hundred keV), and no preformation factor assists it. In effect the Gamow factor for proton emission from heavy nuclei becomes very large, leading to an exponentially small tunnelling probability.\n\nStep 4. Summary and Final Comparison\n\nThus, we arrive at the following points:\n• For heavy nuclei the Q–value for α–emission is relatively large (a few MeV positive) because of the extra binding energy of the α–particle. In contrast, for proton emission the nucleus is typically bound, and only nuclei very far from stability (among light, proton–rich nuclei) have positive Q‐values.\n• The α–particle is a strongly bound, preformed cluster of two protons and two neutrons. This preformation increases the probability that an α cluster exists near the surface, ready to tunnel out. For a single proton there is no such preformation.\n• The tunnelling probability is governed by an exponential, exp(–2G), with G being larger if the effective product of charges is larger or if Q is smaller. For α–decay, although the Coulomb factor is larger (due to the charge 2 on the α–particle), the Q–value is sufficiently high and the preformation factor is non–negligible. For proton emission in heavy nuclei, both the energetic conditions (negative or very low Q) and absence of a cluster effect conspire to render the tunnelling probability extremely small.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\nHeavy nuclei can readily decay by α–emission because they have sufficiently high Q–values and a significant preformation probability for the α–cluster, so tunnelling through the Coulomb barrier is feasible. In contrast, proton emission in heavy nuclei is essentially suppressed because (a) the proton separation energy remains positive (the nucleus is energetically stable against proton emission), and (b) even if proton emission were energetically allowed, the tunnelling probability is exponentially small due to both a lower Q–value and the absence of a preformed proton cluster. \n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{α–radioactivity is common because heavy nuclei have a positive Q–value for emitting a preformed, strongly-bound α–particle, while proton emission is suppressed both energetically and by a very small tunnelling probability.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{α–radioactivity is common because heavy nuclei have a positive Q–value for emitting a preformed, strongly-bound α–particle, while proton emission is suppressed both energetically and by a very small tunnelling probability.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{α–radioactivity is common because heavy nuclei have a positive Q–value for emitting a preformed, strongly-bound α–particle, while proton emission is suppressed both energetically and by a very small tunnelling probability.}", "expr2": "E_d > 0 \\text{ for } \\alpha\\text{-decay (for } A \\geq 150\\text{); } -\\varepsilon < 0 \\text{ for proton-decay}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Lifetime in the Rest Frame and Gamma Factor\n\nThe natural lifetime (in the particle rest frame) is given by\n\n  τ₀ = ħ/Γ.\n\nIn natural units (using MeV and s):\n\n• Use ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻²² MeV·s.  \n• Convert Γ = 63 keV = 0.063 MeV.\n\nThus,\n  τ₀ = (6.582 × 10⁻²² MeV·s) / (0.063 MeV) ≈ 1.044 × 10⁻²⁰ s.\n\nNext, we require the Lorentz boost factor γ. The total energy in the lab is\n\n  E₍lab₎ = √(p²c² + m²c⁴).\n \nSince p ≫ m (100 GeV versus 3.097 GeV) we have E₍lab₎ ≈ 100 GeV. Thus\n\n  γ = E₍lab₎ / m₍J/ψ₎ ≈ 100 GeV / 3.097 GeV ≈ 32.3.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. (a) Mean Distance Traveled in the Laboratory\n\nIn the lab frame the lifetime is dilated by γ:\n\n  τ₍lab₎ = γ τ₀ ≈ 32.3 × 1.044 × 10⁻²⁰ s ≈ 3.37 × 10⁻¹⁹ s.\n\nSince the average decay distance is\n\n  L = β c τ₍lab₎, \n\nand for such a highly relativistic particle β ≈ 1, we have\n\n  L ≈ c τ₍lab₎ ≈ (3.00 × 10⁸ m/s) × (3.37 × 10⁻¹⁹ s)\n      ≈ 1.01 × 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n\nThus, the J/ψ travels about 0.1 nanometers on average before decaying.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 3. (b) Energy of the Decay Electron in the Laboratory (Symmetric Decay)\n\nIn the rest frame of the J/ψ the two decay products have equal energy (since the decay is into two particles and electron masses are negligible compared to 1.55 GeV):\n  E*ₑ = m₍J/ψ₎/2 ≈ 3.097 GeV/2 ≈ 1.5485 GeV.\n\nNow we want a configuration where in the lab the two electrons come out with equal energies. In a two‐body decay the electrons will be back‐to‐back in the J/ψ rest frame. Their energies in the lab depend on the emission angle with respect to the boost direction. Let θ* be the angle in the J/ψ rest frame relative to the boost direction. The Lorentz transformation of energy gives\n\n  E₍lab₎ = γ (E*ₑ + β p*ₑ cosθ*),\n\nwith p*ₑ ≈ E*ₑ (since mₑ is negligible). For the two electrons we have one going at angle θ* and the other at (π – θ*), which yield energies\n\n  E₁ = γ (E*ₑ + β E*ₑ cosθ*) and E₂ = γ (E*ₑ - β E*ₑ cosθ*).\n\nFor these to be equal we must have cosθ* = 0; that is, the electrons must be emitted perpendicular to the boost in the particle’s rest frame. Then\n  E₍lab₎ = γ E*ₑ ≈ 32.3 × 1.5485 GeV ≈ 50 GeV.\n\nThus, the decay electron (and positron) each have about 50 GeV in the lab frame.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 4. (c) Laboratory Angle of the Electron\n\nIn the rest frame, for this symmetric configuration the electron’s momentum is purely transverse to the boost. Under Lorentz transformation the components transform as follows:\n • Longitudinal (parallel) component: p₍∥₎ = γ ( p* cosθ* + βE* ).  \n • Transverse component: p₍⊥₎ = p* sinθ*.\n\nSince here cosθ* = 0 and sinθ* = 1, we have:\n  p₍∥₎ = γ β E*ₑ, and p₍⊥₎ = E*ₑ.\n\nThe laboratory angle θ₍lab₎ between the electron’s momentum and the boost (J/ψ) direction is given by\n\n  tanθ₍lab₎ = p₍⊥₎ / p₍∥₎ = E*ₑ / (γ β E*ₑ) = 1/(γβ).\n\nWith β very nearly 1, we have\n\n  tanθ₍lab₎ ≈ 1/32.3 ≈ 0.031,\n  θ₍lab₎ ≈ 0.031 rad  (which is about 1.8°).\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) Mean laboratory decay distance:\n  L ≈ 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁰ m;\n\n(b) Laboratory energy of each decay electron:\n  Eₑ ≈ 50 GeV;\n\n(c) Laboratory angle (with respect to the J/ψ direction) of the electron:\n  θ ≈ 0.031 rad (≈ 1.8°).\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Box:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad L &\\approx 1.0\\times10^{-10}\\,\\text{m}, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad E_e &\\approx 50\\,\\text{GeV}, \\\\\n\\text{(c)}\\quad \\theta_{\\text{lab}} &\\approx 0.031\\,\\text{rad}\\ (\\approx 1.8^\\circ).\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad L &\\approx 1.0\\times10^{-10}\\,\\text{m}, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad E_e &\\approx 50\\,\\text{GeV}, \\\\\n\\text{(c)}\\quad \\theta_{\\text{lab}} &\\approx 0.031\\,\\text{rad}\\ (\\approx 1.8^\\circ).\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad L &\\approx 1.0\\times10^{-10}\\,\\text{m}, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad E_e &\\approx 50\\,\\text{GeV}, \\\\\n\\text{(c)}\\quad \\theta_{\\text{lab}} &\\approx 0.031\\,\\text{rad}\\ (\\approx 1.8^\\circ).\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "1.012 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad L &\\approx 1.0\\times10^{-10}\\,\\text{m}, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad E_e &\\approx 50\\,\\text{GeV}, \\\\\n\\text{(c)}\\quad \\theta_{\\text{lab}} &\\approx 0.031\\,\\text{rad}\\ (\\approx 1.8^\\circ).\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "50.024 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad L &\\approx 1.0\\times10^{-10}\\,\\text{m}, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad E_e &\\approx 50\\,\\text{GeV}, \\\\\n\\text{(c)}\\quad \\theta_{\\text{lab}} &\\approx 0.031\\,\\text{rad}\\ (\\approx 1.8^\\circ).\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "1.77^\\circ"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-1", "solution": "We start by considering what “putting the contents of a physics library on a very smooth postcard” truly implies. The idea is that an enormous amount of information has been encoded at a very high density on a surface that is smooth (almost “featureless” to the unaided eye). For the information to be stored in such a compressed form, the encoding must be done at a microscopic—indeed, perhaps even an atomic—level.\n\nNow, an electron microscope does have enough resolution to see details at the nanometer or even (with advanced techniques) atomic scale. However, there are several important issues to address:\n\n1. Area versus Resolution: Although an electron microscope can resolve very fine details over a very small field of view, the area of a postcard is huge relative to an atomic scale image. Imaging an entire postcard at atomic resolution would require many, many individual high-resolution scans and then a perfect alignment and stitching process. This is not only time‐consuming but technically very challenging.\n\n2. Contrast and Encoded Data: Electron microscopes work by detecting variations in electron scattering that result from differences in the material’s composition, density, or structure. If the encoding process has been adjusted to pack an enormous amount of digitally “readable” information on the postcard (say, by different patterns at the atomic level), the contrast differences might be very subtle. It would then be a challenge to reliably decipher which patterns encode which information. In other words, even if you can image the surface, you’d need to know precisely how to interpret each minute variation in the image as “data” corresponding to the library content.\n\n3. Practical Read-Out Limitations: Even if one assumed that every bit of information was encoded in a way visible by an electron microscope, the process of reading all of it would be highly impractical. The scanning electron microscope (or transmission electron microscope) typically operates on small regions at a time. Scanning an entire postcard at the correct resolution and then processing the data into ‘readable’ text or images would be an overwhelming task.\n\n4. Non-Destructive Reading: Electron microscopes, especially at high resolution, might require conditions (like high vacuum and potentially even beam-induced damage) that are not ideal for delicate, high-density data storage. A specimen prepared for electron microscopy usually undergoes procedures that might alter the atomic arrangement unless extra care is taken.\n\nIn summary, while an electron microscope theoretically has the resolution to see features at the scale that might be used to encode dense information, it alone is not sufficient to “read” a postcard that holds the entire physics library. You would need additional technology and a very clever encoding/decoding scheme that adapts the raw image data into the memorable information (text, images, formulas, etc.). Also, the scanning, data stitching, and interpretation challenges make it impractical to use an electron microscope as a reader for such hyper-dense storage.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{No. An electron microscope, while able to resolve atomic-scale features, cannot practically decode the enormous, densely encoded information on a postcard without an elaborate, specialized readout system.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{No. An electron microscope, while able to resolve atomic-scale features, cannot practically decode the enormous, densely encoded information on a postcard without an elaborate, specialized readout system.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{No. An electron microscope, while able to resolve atomic-scale features, cannot practically decode the enormous, densely encoded information on a postcard without an elaborate, specialized readout system.}", "expr2": "\\text{Yes, it will be readable with an electron microscope.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

In what follows we shall denote\n\n  • For a proton and 4 pions, the minimal (rest) mass is\n    Mₓ = mₚ + 4 m_π   (since at threshold the pions are produced at rest relative to the proton).\n\nWe now use the invariant Mandelstam variable s which is the square of the total 4‐momentum. In the laboratory frame one proton (the target) is at rest and the projectile has total energy E. (We use “total energy” meaning the relativistic energy which includes the rest energy.) Thus\n  s = (p_projectile + p_target)² = mₚ² + mₚ² + 2mₚ E = 2mₚ (E + mₚ).\n\nAt threshold the final state is produced with zero relative kinetic energy in the overall center‐of‐mass. Then the total energy (in the cm frame) is just the sum of the rest masses of the two final “clusters.”\n\nBelow we describe the three cases.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Reaction 1 (Target dissociates)\n\nReaction 1 (target dissociates) is\n  p + p → p + (p + 4π).\nHere the projectile remains intact (with mass mₚ) and the target dissociates to an excited system of mass Mₓ = mₚ + 4 m_π.\n\nThus, the threshold condition is\n\n  √s_thresh = mₚ + (mₚ + 4 m_π) = 2 mₚ + 4 m_π.\n\nBut we already have\n  s = 2 mₚ (E + mₚ).\n\nThus, at threshold:\n  √[2 mₚ (E + mₚ)] = 2 mₚ + 4 m_π.\nSquaring both sides, we have\n  2 mₚ (E + mₚ) = (2 mₚ + 4 m_π)².\nLet us expand the right‐hand side:\n  (2mₚ + 4m_π)² = 4mₚ² + 16 mₚ m_π + 16 m_π².\nThus,\n  E + mₚ = [4mₚ² + 16 mₚ m_π + 16 m_π²] / (2 mₚ)\n      = 2mₚ + 8 m_π + (16 m_π²)/(2 mₚ)\n      = 2mₚ + 8 m_π + (8 m_π²)/mₚ.\nThen,\n  E_thresh = (E + mₚ) − mₚ = mₚ + 8 m_π + (8 m_π²)/mₚ.\n\nNow substitute the numbers:\n  mₚ = 0.938 GeV, m_π = 0.140 GeV.\nFirst, 8 m_π = 8 × 0.140 = 1.12 GeV.\nNext, m_π² = (0.140)² = 0.0196 GeV² and so, (8 m_π²)/mₚ = (8 × 0.0196)/0.938 ≃ 0.1568/0.938 ≃ 0.167 GeV.\nThus,\n  E_thresh ≃ 0.938 + 1.12 + 0.167 ≃ 2.225 GeV.\nThis is the answer for (a).\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Reaction 1 (Projectile dissociates)\n\nNow consider reaction 1 when it is the projectile that “diffractively dissociates.” That reaction is written as\n\n  p + p → (p + 4π) + p.\nIn this case the excited system (with mass Mₓ = mₚ + 4 m_π) comes from the projectile, but the final state still consists of two bodies:\n  – one of mass Mₓ = mₚ + 4 m_π,\n  – one of mass mₚ.\nThus the threshold condition in the cm‐frame is\n  √s_thresh = (mₚ + 4 m_π) + mₚ = 2 mₚ + 4 m_π,\nwhich is identical to the previous case. Since the invariant s is the same function in the lab (s = 2 mₚ (E + mₚ)), the same algebra holds and we obtain\n\n  E_thresh = mₚ + 8 m_π + (8 m_π²)/mₚ\nnumerically E_thresh ≃ 2.225 GeV.\nSo the answer for (b) is the same as (a).\n(Notice that although the lab distributions of momenta differ, the minimal beam energy requirement is determined by s, which is the same in both cases.)\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Reaction 2 (Both protons dissociate)\n\nNow consider reaction 2:\n  p + p → (p + 4π) + (p + 4π).\nHere both protons dissociate so that each excited system has the same minimal mass\n  Mₓ = mₚ + 4 m_π.\nThus the threshold condition in the center‐of‐mass is\n\n  √s_thresh = (mₚ + 4 m_π) + (mₚ + 4 m_π) = 2 mₚ + 8 m_π.\nSince in the lab s = 2 mₚ (E + mₚ), we set\n  √[2 mₚ (E + mₚ)] = 2 mₚ + 8 m_π.\nSquaring, we have\n  2 mₚ (E + mₚ) = (2 mₚ + 8 m_π)².\nExpanding the right‐hand side gives\n  (2 mₚ + 8 m_π)² = 4 mₚ² + 32 mₚ m_π + 64 m_π².\nThus,\n  E + mₚ = [4 mₚ² + 32 mₚ m_π + 64 m_π²] / (2 mₚ)\n      = 2 mₚ + 16 m_π + (64 m_π²)/(2 mₚ)\n      = 2 mₚ + 16 m_π + (32 m_π²)/mₚ.\nThen the threshold beam energy is\n  E_thresh = (E + mₚ) – mₚ = mₚ + 16 m_π + (32 m_π²)/mₚ.\nSubstitute the numbers:\n  16 m_π = 16 × 0.140 = 2.24 GeV.\n  m_π² = 0.0196 GeV², so (32 m_π²)/mₚ = (32 × 0.0196) / 0.938 ≃ (0.6272)/0.938 ≃ 0.669 GeV.\nTherefore,\n  E_thresh ≃ 0.938 + 2.24 + 0.669 ≃ 3.847 GeV.\nThat is the answer for (c).\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) For reaction 1 with target dissociation, the threshold beam energy is\n  E = mₚ + 8 m_π + (8 m_π²)/mₚ ≃ 2.23 GeV.\n\n(b) For reaction 1 with projectile dissociation, one obtains the same threshold:\n  E ≃ 2.23 GeV.\n\n(c) For reaction 2 (both protons dissociate) the threshold beam energy is\n  E = mₚ + 16 m_π + (32 m_π²)/mₚ ≃ 3.85 GeV.\n\nWe now give the final answers in boxed LaTeX:\n  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n(a)\\; E &= m_p + 8\\,m_\\pi + \\frac{8\\,m_\\pi^2}{m_p} \\approx 2.23\\;\\text{GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n(b)\\; E &= m_p + 8\\,m_\\pi + \\frac{8\\,m_\\pi^2}{m_p} \\approx 2.23\\;\\text{GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n(c)\\; E &= m_p + 16\\,m_\\pi + \\frac{32\\,m_\\pi^2}{m_p} \\approx 3.85\\;\\text{GeV}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n(a)\\; E &= m_p + 8\\,m_\\pi + \\frac{8\\,m_\\pi^2}{m_p} \\approx 2.23\\;\\text{GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n(b)\\; E &= m_p + 8\\,m_\\pi + \\frac{8\\,m_\\pi^2}{m_p} \\approx 2.23\\;\\text{GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n(c)\\; E &= m_p + 16\\,m_\\pi + \\frac{32\\,m_\\pi^2}{m_p} \\approx 3.85\\;\\text{GeV}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n(a)\\; E &= m_p + 8\\,m_\\pi + \\frac{8\\,m_\\pi^2}{m_p} \\approx 2.23\\;\\text{GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n(b)\\; E &= m_p + 8\\,m_\\pi + \\frac{8\\,m_\\pi^2}{m_p} \\approx 2.23\\;\\text{GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n(c)\\; E &= m_p + 16\\,m_\\pi + \\frac{32\\,m_\\pi^2}{m_p} \\approx 3.85\\;\\text{GeV}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "E = 2.225 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n(a)\\; E &= m_p + 8\\,m_\\pi + \\frac{8\\,m_\\pi^2}{m_p} \\approx 2.23\\;\\text{GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n(b)\\; E &= m_p + 8\\,m_\\pi + \\frac{8\\,m_\\pi^2}{m_p} \\approx 2.23\\;\\text{GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n(c)\\; E &= m_p + 16\\,m_\\pi + \\frac{32\\,m_\\pi^2}{m_p} \\approx 3.85\\;\\text{GeV}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "E = 2.225 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n(a)\\; E &= m_p + 8\\,m_\\pi + \\frac{8\\,m_\\pi^2}{m_p} \\approx 2.23\\;\\text{GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n(b)\\; E &= m_p + 8\\,m_\\pi + \\frac{8\\,m_\\pi^2}{m_p} \\approx 2.23\\;\\text{GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n(c)\\; E &= m_p + 16\\,m_\\pi + \\frac{32\\,m_\\pi^2}{m_p} \\approx 3.85\\;\\text{GeV}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "E = 3.847 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

In this case each proton has the same energy, say E′, so that\n\n  s = (p₁ + p₂)² = (E′ + E′)² – (p⃗_1 + p⃗_2)².\n\nSince the momenta are equal and opposite, p⃗_1 + p⃗_2 = 0, hence\n  s = (2E′)² = 4E′².\n\nAt threshold the total energy must equal the rest energy of the final state:\n  2E′ = 2mₚ + M    (8)\nThus,\n  E′ = mₚ + M/2    (9)\n\nSo in the symmetric case each proton must have energy\n  E_min (each beam) = mₚ + M/2,\nwith a kinetic energy of\n  K = (M/2).\n\nFinal Answers:\n\nFor a fixed–target collision, the minimum lab energy of the moving proton is\n\n  E_min = mₚ + 2M + (M²/(2mₚ))   \n  (in which the kinetic energy is K = 2M + M²/(2mₚ)).\n\nFor a head–on collision (equal velocities), each proton must have energy\n\n  E_min = mₚ + M/2   \n  (with kinetic energy K = M/2).\n\nThus, in summary, we state our final answers in a boxed form:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) Fixed target: } E_{\\text{min}} = m_p + 2M + \\frac{M^2}{2m_p}\\quad \\text{(total energy; kinetic energy }K=2M+\\frac{M^2}{2m_p}\\text{)}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b) Colliding beams: } E_{\\text{min}} = m_p + \\frac{M}{2}\\quad \\text{(for each proton; }K=\\frac{M}{2}\\text{)}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) Fixed target: } E_{\\text{min}} = m_p + 2M + \\frac{M^2}{2m_p}\\quad \\text{(total energy; kinetic energy }K=2M+\\frac{M^2}{2m_p}\\text{)}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b) Colliding beams: } E_{\\text{min}} = m_p + \\frac{M}{2}\\quad \\text{(for each proton; }K=\\frac{M}{2}\\text{)}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) Fixed target: } E_{\\text{min}} = m_p + 2M + \\frac{M^2}{2m_p}\\quad \\text{(total energy; kinetic energy }K=2M+\\frac{M^2}{2m_p}\\text{)}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b) Colliding beams: } E_{\\text{min}} = m_p + \\frac{M}{2}\\quad \\text{(for each proton; }K=\\frac{M}{2}\\text{)}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "E_p = m_p + 2M + \\frac{M^2}{2m_p}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-6", "solution": "We must remember that a measured line width is rarely as narrow as the “natural” (lifetime) width because several physical processes tend to “smear” the line. In a hot, dense plasma with a non‐uniform magnetic field, several mechanisms contribute. Let us discuss these one by one and then illustrate one with an order‐of‐magnitude calculation.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Discuss the Broadening Mechanisms\n\n1. Natural (or lifetime) broadening:\n  Any excited state has a finite lifetime (τ) and so, by the energy–time uncertainty principle, the emitted photon has an intrinsic energy (and hence wavelength) uncertainty ΔE ~ ℏ/τ. This gives a “natural” line width which is normally very small.\n\n2. Thermal Doppler broadening:\n  Because the ions have a thermal spread (with temperature given by kT = 20 eV), each emitter has a velocity relative to the observer. The Doppler effect shifts the wavelength by an amount proportional to the velocity. In a Maxwellian distribution the spread in the velocities leads to a broadening Δλ_D which (to order‐of‐magnitude) is given by \n    Δλ_D ≅ (λ₀/c)v_th\n  with the one‐dimensional thermal speed v_th ≅ √(2kT/m). This is very often the dominant broadening in hot plasmas.\n\n3. Collisional (or pressure) broadening:\n  At high density (here n ~ 10²⁴ m⁻³) the frequent collisions between ions (and with electrons) perturb the energy levels. This leads to additional broadening, usually via a “collision‐induced” uncertainty in the phase of the emitting state.\n\n4. Zeeman broadening:\n  In the presence of a magnetic field (here up to B = 1 T) the energy levels split into several Zeeman components. If the magnetic field is nonuniform (or if there is an ensemble of ions in slightly different B fields), then the resulting line is a blend of many components, effectively broadening the observed line.\n\nThus, even if the natural width is extremely narrow, the thermal motion, density effects, and magnetic field (Zeeman) effects can easily make the observed width Δλ much larger.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Order‐of‐Magnitude Estimate for Doppler Broadening\n\nWe now choose thermal Doppler broadening as an example to calculate Δλ. For an ion of mass m and temperature T, the thermal speed is\n\n  v_th = √(2kT/m).\n\nFor carbon-12, we take the mass as\n\n  m ≈ 12 u ≈ 12 · 1.66×10⁻²⁷ kg ≈ 2×10⁻²⁶ kg.\n\nThe ion temperature is given via kT = 20 eV. Converting to joules:\n\n  kT ≈ 20 eV × 1.6×10⁻¹⁹ J/eV ≈ 3.2×10⁻¹⁸ J.\n\nThus,\n\n  v_th ≈ √((2×3.2×10⁻¹⁸ J)/(2×10⁻²⁶ kg))\n      = √( (6.4×10⁻¹⁸)/(2×10⁻²⁶) )\n      = √(3.2×10⁸) m/s\n      ≈ 1.8×10⁴ m/s.\n\nThe Doppler shift for a single emitter is then (to lowest order for v ≪ c):\n\n  Δλ/λ ≅ v/c    or   Δλ ≅ (λ₀/c) v_th.\n\nUsing λ₀ = 500 nm = 500×10⁻⁹ m and c ≈ 3×10⁸ m/s:\n\n  Δλ ≅ (500×10⁻⁹ m / 3×10⁸ m/s) × (1.8×10⁴ m/s)\n     ≅ 500×10⁻⁹ m × 6×10⁻⁵ \n     ≅ 3×10⁻¹¹ m.\n\nThus, the order-of-magnitude width due to thermal Doppler broadening is about 3×10⁻¹¹ m.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n(a) The observed transition line may be significantly broadened by several mechanisms:\n  • Natural (lifetime) broadening,\n  • Thermal Doppler broadening (due to the ions’ thermal velocity spread),\n  • Collisional (or pressure) broadening (due to the high density),\n  • Zeeman broadening (because the nonuniform magnetic field causes varying energy shifts).\n\n(b) Taking thermal Doppler broadening as an example, with v_th ≈ √(2kT/m) ≈ 1.8×10⁴ m/s, one obtains\n  Δλ ≈ (λ₀/c) v_th ≈ 500×10⁻⁹ m × (1.8×10⁴/3×10⁸) ≈ 3×10⁻¹¹ m.\n\nThe final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Delta\\lambda \\sim 3 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{m} \\quad \\text{(due to thermal Doppler broadening)}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\Delta\\lambda \\sim 3 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{m} \\quad \\text{(due to thermal Doppler broadening)}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\Delta\\lambda \\sim 3 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{m} \\quad \\text{(due to thermal Doppler broadening)}", "expr2": "\\Gamma_D = 2 \\, \\text{cm}^{-1}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Let the electron be at rest, so its four‐momentum is P_e,i = (m, 0).\n• The photon’s four‐momentum is P_γ = (E, Ê), where Ê is the momentum vector (magnitude E).\n\nIf the electron were to absorb the photon completely, the final particle is just an electron of mass m with some momentum p.\n\nEnergy conservation gives:  \n  m + E = E_final  (1)\n\nMomentum conservation gives:  \n  0 + E = p_final  (2)\n\nFor a free electron, its energy and momentum satisfy:\n  E_final² = p_final² + m².  \nPlugging (1) and (2) in:  \n  (m + E)² = E² + m².  \nExpanding the LHS:  \n  m² + 2mE + E² = E² + m²,  \nso we are left with:  \n  2mE = 0.  \nSince m > 0 and E > 0 (nonzero photon energy), this yields a contradiction.  \n\nThus, a free electron cannot absorb a photon fully because energy and momentum cannot both be conserved.  \nSo, process (a) is impossible.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nProcess (b): A single photon in empty space is transformed into an electron and a positron.\n\nLet the photon have four‐momentum P_γ = (E, p⃗) with |p⃗| = E in units where c = 1. For pair production, suppose that the electron and positron (each of mass m) have four‐momenta P_e and P_pos. Conservation of four‐momentum requires:  \n  P_γ = P_e + P_pos.\n\nThe invariant mass squared of the photon is zero:  \n  P_γ² = 0.\n\nOn the other hand, the electron and positron have rest mass m and are on-shell:\n  P_e² = m²,  P_pos² = m².\n\nSince energy–momentum is conserved, the invariant mass of the final state is:  \n  (P_e + P_pos)² = P_e² + 2P_e · P_pos + P_pos² = 2m² + 2P_e · P_pos.\n\nThis must equal 0 (the invariant mass squared of the initial state). That is,  \n  2m² + 2P_e · P_pos = 0 ⟹ P_e · P_pos = –m².\n\nHowever, since the dot product of two time-like four‐vectors (with positive energies) cannot be less than –m² (in fact, for physical momenta it must be positive if the particles are moving in the same time direction), there is no solution that satisfies this condition. In more practical terms, with only one photon there is no other body to take up the extra momentum, so energy‐momentum conservation forbids the process. In practice, pair production is seen near a nucleus that can recoil and provide the necessary momentum balance.  \n\nThus, process (b) is impossible in free space.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nProcess (c): A fast positron and a stationary electron annihilate, producing only one photon.\n\nIn usual electron–positron annihilation, two photons are produced so that one can conserve momentum (the two photons can go off in different directions, balancing momentum while still giving the correct total energy). Let’s check the case with only one photon.\n\nLet the electron be at rest with four‐momentum P_e = (m, 0) and the positron have four‐momentum P_pos = (E, p⃗), where E > m. The total initial four‐momentum is:  \n  P_initial = P_e + P_pos = (m + E, p⃗).\n\nThe final state consists of one photon with four‐momentum P_γ = (E_γ, p⃗_γ). For the photon, E_γ = |p⃗_γ|. Conservation of four‐momentum implies:  \n  E_γ = m + E  and  p⃗_γ = p⃗.\n\nNow consider the invariant mass squared of the initial state:\n  P_initial² = (m + E)² – |p⃗|².\nBut p⃗ is nonzero (because the positron is fast), so clearly (m+E)² – |p⃗|² > 0 (the system has nonzero invariant mass).\nOn the other hand, the photon’s invariant mass is zero, i.e.,  \n  P_γ² = 0.\n\nThus, conservation of the invariant mass is violated because one cannot have a massless photon resulting from an initial state with nonzero invariant mass.

{"id": "atomic/1-8", "solution": "We can describe each of these effects or rules as follows:\n\n(a) Auger effect  \nWhen an inner-shell electron is removed from an atom (creating a vacancy), an electron from a higher energy level may drop down to fill the hole. The energy released in this transition can be transferred not as a photon but instead to another electron, which is then ejected from the atom. This ejected electron is called an Auger electron. In short, the Auger effect is a radiationless de-excitation process that competes with X‐ray fluorescence.\n\n(b) Anomalous Zeeman effect  \nWhen an atom is placed in a magnetic field, its electronic energy levels split. In the “normal” Zeeman effect (for states with zero spin), the splitting is into equally spaced components. However, many atoms have unpaired electron spins; therefore the total angular momentum is a combination of orbital and spin moments. The anomalous Zeeman effect refers to the more complicated and generally unequal splitting patterns that occur in such cases when spin–orbit coupling is taken into account.\n\n(c) Lamb shift  \nThe Lamb shift is a small difference in energy between two levels (specifically, the 2S₁/₂ and 2P₁/₂ levels of hydrogen) that are predicted to be degenerate in the Dirac theory. It arises due to quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects such as vacuum fluctuations (vacuum polarization) and the electron’s self-energy. These subtle corrections are critical tests of QED.\n\n(d) Landé interval rule  \nThe Landé interval rule provides a way to predict the spacing between consecutive levels in a multiplet produced by spin–orbit coupling. It states that the energy separation between two successive levels (with angular momentum quantum numbers J and J – 1) is proportional to the larger value of J. In mathematical terms, if the splitting constant is A, then the spacing is A·J. This rule is very helpful in analyzing fine structure multiplets.\n\n(e) Hund’s rules for atomic levels  \nHund’s rules are empirical guidelines used to determine the order of the energy levels (terms) arising from a given electron configuration in an atom:\n 1. For a given configuration, the term with the highest total spin S (i.e., maximum multiplicity) lies lowest in energy.  \n 2. For terms having the same total spin S, the term with the largest total orbital angular momentum L has lower energy.  \n 3. For a given term (fixed S and L), if the subshell is less than half filled the level with the smallest total angular momentum J is lowest in energy, while if it is more than half-filled the level with largest J lies lowest.\n  \nThus, the above succinctly describes each effect or rule.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a) Auger effect: } &\\text{After an inner-shell vacancy is filled by an outer electron, the released energy ejects a second electron (the Auger electron) rather than being emitted as an X-ray.} \\\\\n\\text{(b) Anomalous Zeeman effect: } &\\text{The splitting of atomic energy levels in a magnetic field that involves electron spin, leading to uneven (non-equal) splitting patterns.} \\\\\n\\text{(c) Lamb shift: } &\\text{A small QED-induced energy difference (notably between the 2S}_{1/2}\\text{ and 2P}_{1/2}\\text{ levels in hydrogen) due to vacuum fluctuations and self-energy corrections.} \\\\\n\\text{(d) Landé interval rule: } &\\text{In a multiplet, the energy separation between levels with quantum numbers }J\\text{ and }J - 1\\text{ is proportional to }J. \\\\\n\\text{(e) Hund's rules: } &\\text{Empirical rules for ordering atomic levels: (1) maximum total spin S is lowest in energy;

{"id": "atomic/3-34", "solution": "We are told that in the reaction\n\n  K⁻ + p → Λ⁰ + π⁺ + π⁻\n\none sees a resonance (called Y₁*) in the Λ⁰π invariant‐mass spectrum near 1385 MeV (with a width of about 50 MeV). In a separate set of events the Λ⁰π⁻ spectrum shows the same resonance. This tells us that the Y₁* decays into Λ⁰π (with different charges). Let us analyze what one may deduce from the data.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Determine Strangeness, Hypercharge, and Isospin\n\n1. Strangeness:  \n • The Λ⁰ is a strange baryon with S = –1 (and no net pion strangeness).  \n • Since the initial resonance decays into a Λ⁰ (S = –1) plus a pion (S = 0), the Y₁* must have S = –1.\n\n2. Hypercharge:  \n • Hypercharge (Y) is defined (in the baryon sector) as Y = B + S.  \n • Here B (baryon number) = 1 and S = –1, so Y = 1 – 1 = 0.\n\n3. Isospin:  \n • The fact that one sees both Λ⁰π⁺ and Λ⁰π⁻ final states, i.e. two different charge combinations, requires that the decaying state must have non‐zero isospin.  \n • In fact, these two channels are consistent with the three charge states of an isospin triplet, I = 1, even though not all charge states are necessarily observed in that particular reaction.  \n • (Indeed, the well‐known Σ*(1385) has I = 1.)\n\nThus, for Y₁* we have:  \n Strangeness S = –1,  \n Hypercharge Y = 0,  \n Isospin I = 1.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Possible Spin and Parity Assignments\n\nThe hint tells us that the intrinsic parities of the decay products are:\n\n  P(Λ⁰) = +  P(π⁺) = –\n\nand we are told that the Λ⁰ and π⁺ emerge in a relative p state, i.e. an orbital angular momentum L = 1.\n\n1. Spin Considerations:  \n • The Λ⁰ is a spin ½ baryon and the pion is spin 0.  \n • In the decay, the total angular momentum J is found by vector addition of the Λ⁰ spin (½) and the relative orbital angular momentum (L = 1).  \n • The allowed values are:  \n  J = |L – ½|, L + ½ → i.e., J = ½ or 3/2.\n\n2. Parity Considerations:  \n • The overall parity of a two-particle state is given by  \n  P_total = P(Λ⁰) P(π⁺)(–1)^L  \n • With P(Λ⁰) = +, P(π⁺) = –, and L = 1, we have  \n  P_total = (+)(–)(–1)^1 = (–)(–1) = +.  \n • Therefore, the resonance has intrinsic parity +.\n\nThus, from the p-wave decay into Λ⁰π⁺ we deduce that the possible spin assignments for Y₁* are J = ½ or J = 3/2, and that its intrinsic parity is positive, i.e. Jᴾ = ½⁺ or 3/2⁺. (In practice the Σ*(1385) is known to have J = 3/2⁺.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Other Strong Decay Modes\n\nSince Y₁* (with S = –1 and I = 1) is a hyperon resonance (essentially the Σ*(1385)) it will decay via the strong interaction. Apart from the observed Λ⁰π decay mode, one should consider other channels that conserve the relevant quantum numbers.\n\n1. The most obvious alternative is decay into Σπ:  \n • Note that the Σ baryons (with S = –1) have masses around 1190 MeV, and adding a pion (≈ 140 MeV) gives a threshold near 1330 MeV, which is below 1385 MeV.  \n • This decay, Y₁* → Σ + π, is seen experimentally with a branching ratio of roughly 10–15% (with the dominant decay mode being Λπ).  \n • Various charge combinations are possible (Σ⁺π⁰, Σ⁰π⁺, Σ⁻π⁺, etc.) in the isospin scheme.\n\n2. Decay into NK:  \n • The nucleon-kaon channel (N + K) is also in principle allowed by quantum numbers (B = 1, S = 0 for the nucleon and S = +1 for the kaon) but note that the threshold is approximately m(N) + m(K) ≈ 940 MeV + 495 MeV ≈ 1435 MeV, which is higher than 1385 MeV.  \n • Thus, this channel is kinematically forbidden for Y₁*.\n\nSo, the only additional strong decay mode expected is into the Σπ channel.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n(a) The Y₁* must have strangeness S = –1, hypercharge Y = 0 (since Y = 1 + (–1)) and isospin I = 1.  \n\n(b) In its decay into Λ⁰ (spin ½) and π (spin 0) in a relative p wave (L = 1), angular momentum conservation allows for J = ½ or 3/2. Moreover, the overall parity is  \n P = P(Λ⁰) P(π) (–1)^L = (+)(–)(–1) = +, so Y₁* has intrinsic parity +.\n\n(c) In addition to the observed Λπ decay, one expects that Y₁* can decay into Σπ (with various charge combinations) since the threshold for Σ (∼1190 MeV) plus π (∼140 MeV) is lower than 1385 MeV. The NK channel is kinematically not allowed.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) } S=-1,\\quad Y=0, \\quad I=1.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) } \\text{Possible spins: } J=\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ or } \\frac{3}{2},\\quad \\text{with intrinsic parity } +.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c) } \\text{Other allowed strong decays are into } \\Sigma\\pi \\text{ channels (with the NK channel forbidden by kinematics).}\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) } S=-1,\\quad Y=0, \\quad I=1.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) } \\text{Possible spins: } J=\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ or } \\frac{3}{2},\\quad \\text{with intrinsic parity } +.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c) } \\text{Other allowed strong decays are into } \\Sigma\\pi \\text{ channels (with the NK channel forbidden by kinematics).}\n\\end{array}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) } S=-1,\\quad Y=0, \\quad I=1.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) } \\text{Possible spins: } J=\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ or } \\frac{3}{2},\\quad \\text{with intrinsic parity } +.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c) } \\text{Other allowed strong decays are into } \\Sigma\\pi \\text{ channels (with the NK channel forbidden by kinematics).}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "S(Y_1^{*}) = -1, \\quad Y(Y_1^{*}) = 0, \\quad I(Y_1^{*}) = 1, \\quad I_3(Y_1^{*}) = 1"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) } S=-1,\\quad Y=0, \\quad I=1.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) } \\text{Possible spins: } J=\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ or } \\frac{3}{2},\\quad \\text{with intrinsic parity } +.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c) } \\text{Other allowed strong decays are into } \\Sigma\\pi \\text{ channels (with the NK channel forbidden by kinematics).}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "J_{Y_1^*} = \\{1/2, 3/2\\}, \\quad P(Y_1^*) = +1"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) } S=-1,\\quad Y=0, \\quad I=1.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b) } \\text{Possible spins: } J=\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ or } \\frac{3}{2},\\quad \\text{with intrinsic parity } +.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c) } \\text{Other allowed strong decays are into } \\Sigma\\pi \\text{ channels (with the NK channel forbidden by kinematics).}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "Y_1^{*} \\to \\Sigma\\pi"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/4-23", "solution": "We wish to know for which kinetic energies T of an incident π⁺ beam it is kinematically possible that one of the decay products (the μ⁺) comes out “backward” in the lab frame. (Here “backward” means that its momentum in the lab is in the direction opposite to the π⁺’s momentum.)\n\nThe decay is\n\n  π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\nwith\n  m₍π₎c² = 139.57 MeV,\n  m₍μ₎c² = 105.66 MeV,\n  m₍ν₎c² = 0.\n\nBecause the neutrino is massless, the two‐body decay (in the π rest frame) has fixed energies and momenta. In the π rest frame we denote quantities with an asterisk. Energy and momentum conservation give\n\n  E*₍μ₎ = (m₍π₎² + m₍μ₎²)/(2m₍π₎),\n  p*₍μ₎ = (m₍π₎² – m₍μ₎²)/(2m₍π₎).\n\nIt is straightforward to check that numerically\n  p*₍μ₎ ≈ (139.57² – 105.66²)/(2×139.57) ≈ 29.8 MeV\nand\n  E*₍μ₎ ≈ (139.57² + 105.66²)/(2×139.57) ≈ 109.8 MeV.\n\nNow, in the lab frame the π⁺ beam has kinetic energy T so that its energy is\n\n  E₍π₎ = T + m₍π₎\n\nand its momentum is\n\n  p₍π₎ = √[(T + m₍π₎)² – m₍π₎²] = √[T² + 2m₍π₎T].\n\nThe π⁺ is moving, so the decay products are boosted. If a μ⁺ is emitted in the π rest frame at an angle θ (measured relative to the π⁺’s direction of motion) then a Lorentz boost along the π direction takes its energy and momentum into the lab as\n\n  E₍μ₎ = γ (E*₍μ₎ + βp*₍μ₎cosθ)\n  p₍μ,∥₎ = γ (p*₍μ₎cosθ + βE*₍μ₎)\n\nwhere\n\n  β = p₍π₎/(T + m₍π₎)  and  γ = 1/√(1 – β²).\n\nFor the μ⁺ to be seen going “backward” in the lab, its lab momentum component along the π direction must be negative, i.e.\n\n  p₍μ,∥₎ = γ (p*₍μ₎cosθ + βE*₍μ₎) < 0.\n\nSince γ > 0, this inequality is equivalent to\n\n  p*₍μ₎ cosθ + βE*₍μ₎ < 0   (1)\n\nIn the π rest frame the emission is isotropic so cosθ can vary between –1 and +1. For a given π beam energy (i.e. a given β) there will be some directions (some values of cosθ) for which (1) can be satisfied. However, in order for any angle to work there must be at least one physically allowed value of cosθ; the most “backward‐emitted” μ⁺ (in the lab) comes from the extreme case cosθ = –1. So a necessary condition is that even for cosθ = –1 the muon comes out with negative momentum. That is, we require\n\n  p*₍μ₎ (–1) + βE*₍μ₎ < 0  →   – p*₍μ₎ + βE*₍μ₎ < 0  →  βE*₍μ₎ < p*₍μ₎    (2)\n\nIn other words, the lab speed of the π (or rather β = p₍π₎/(T + m₍π₎)) must be less than the ratio\n\n  p*₍μ₎/E*₍μ₎.\n\nLet us compute that ratio explicitly. We have\n\n  p*₍μ₎ = (m₍π₎² – m₍μ₎²)/(2m₍π₎)\n  E*₍μ₎ = (m₍π₎² + m₍μ₎²)/(2m₍π₎).\n\nThus,\n\n  p*₍μ₎/E*₍μ₎ = (m₍π₎² – m₍μ₎²)/(m₍π₎² + m₍μ₎²).\n\nPlug in the numbers:\n  m₍π₎² ≈ (139.57)² ≈ 19477 (MeV)²\n  m₍μ₎² ≈ (105.66)² ≈ 11166 (MeV)².\n\nThen\n\n  p*₍μ₎/E*₍μ₎ ≈ (19477 – 11166)/(19477 + 11166) = 8311/30643 ≈ 0.271.\n\nThus the condition (2) becomes\n\n  β < 0.271.\n\nRecall β for the π⁺ in the lab is\n\n  β = p₍π₎/(T + m₍π₎) = √(T² + 2m₍π₎T)/(T + m₍π₎).\n\nSo the condition becomes\n\n  √(T² + 2m₍π₎T)/(T + m₍π₎) < 0.271.\n\nWe now wish to solve this inequality for T. It is convenient to solve for the equality (finding the maximum T at which a backward μ⁺ is still kinematically allowed). That is, set\n\n  √(T² + 2m₍π₎T)/(T + m₍π₎) = 0.271.   (3)\n\nSquare both sides to obtain\n\n  (T² + 2m₍π₎T)/(T + m₍π₎)² = 0.271².\n\nA useful algebraic trick is to express T in terms of m₍π₎ in a way that allows an easy solution. However, one can also solve (3) directly. Notice that the left‐side of (3) is just the velocity β of the π in the lab. Hence we can write the condition for the π beam’s kinetic energy T as\n\n  β = √(T² + 2m₍π₎T)/(T + m₍π₎) < 0.271.\n\nIt is easier (and instructive) to solve (3) for T symbolically. Write (3) as\n\n  √(T² + 2m₍π₎T) = 0.271 (T + m₍π₎).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n  T² + 2m₍π₎T = 0.271² (T + m₍π₎)².\n\nDefine β₀ ≡ 0.271 and write β₀² = (m₍π₎² – m₍μ₎²)²/(m₍π₎² + m₍μ₎²)² (which numerically is ≈0.0734). Then\n\n  T² + 2m₍π₎T = β₀² [T² + 2m₍π₎T + m₍π₎²].\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n  T² + 2m₍π₎T – β₀²T² – 2β₀²m₍π₎T – β₀² m₍π₎² = 0,\n\nor\n\n  (1 – β₀²)T² + 2m₍π₎(1 – β₀²)T – β₀² m₍π₎² = 0.\n\nDivide through by (1 – β₀²) (which is ≠ 0):\n\n  T² + 2m₍π₎T – [β₀²/(1 – β₀²)] m₍π₎² = 0.\n\nThis is a quadratic in T. Its positive solution is\n\n  T = –m₍π₎ + m₍π₎ √(1 + β₀²/(1 – β₀²))\n     = m₍π₎ (√(1/(1 – β₀²)) – 1).\n\nSince β₀² = 0.0734, we have\n\n  1/(1 – β₀²) = 1/0.9266 ≈ 1.079,\n  √(1.079) ≈ 1.0383.\n\nThus\n\n  T₍max₎ ≈ m₍π₎ (1.0383 – 1) = m₍π₎ (0.0383).\n\nWith m₍π₎ = 139.57 MeV we find\n\n  T₍max₎ ≈ 139.57 × 0.0383 ≈ 5.35 MeV.\n\nTo summarize, a μ⁺ can only be observed going backward in the lab if the π⁺ is moving slowly enough that its speed β satisfies β < p*₍μ₎/E*₍μ₎ ≈ 0.271. This in turn requires that the kinetic energy of the π⁺ satisfy\n\n  T < T₍max₎ ≈ 5.35 MeV.\n\nFor T = 0 (π⁺ at rest) the muon is emitted isotropically in the π rest frame, so some muons go “backward” (in the lab) automatically. For larger T up to about 5.35 MeV, although the boost tends to push decay products forward, there still exist angles (with cosθ sufficiently negative) such that the μ⁺ emerges with negative (backward) lab momentum. But if T exceeds approximately 5.35 MeV, then for every decay the μ⁺ ends up moving in the lab with a forward component, and no backward μ⁺ is possible.\n\nThus the range of T for which some μ⁺ can be seen going backward is\n\n  0 ≤ T < 5.35 MeV.\n\nWe can now present the final answer.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{ T < m_{\\pi}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{m_{\\pi}^2-m_{\\mu}^2}{m_{\\pi}^2 + m_{\\mu}^2}\\right)^2}}- 1\\right) \\approx 5.35\\,\\text{MeV} }\n\\]", "final_answers": ["T < m_{\\pi}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{m_{\\pi}^2-m_{\\mu}^2}{m_{\\pi}^2 + m_{\\mu}^2}\\right)^2"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "T < m_{\\pi}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{m_{\\pi}^2-m_{\\mu}^2}{m_{\\pi}^2 + m_{\\mu}^2}\\right)^2", "expr2": "T_\\pi \\leq 5.44 \\text{ MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Here, C is the charge‐conjugation operator and I₂ is the second component of the isospin operator. In words, G‐parity is the product of the charge‐conjugation operator and a 180° rotation in isospin space. It was introduced by Gell‐Mann and collaborators to provide a quantum number that is conserved by strong interactions even for charged (non–self–conjugate) states. (For neutral states one could use C parity alone, but for charged states one needs a more general operator; G–parity fills that need.)\n\nLet’s now work through its action on some well–known mesons.\n\nStep 1. Pions\n\nThe three pions form an isospin triplet (I = 1).

The average CMB photon energy is about 0.001 eV. In such a head–on collision (with the photon approaching from the opposite direction to the proton’s motion), relativistic Doppler boosting brings the photon to a much higher energy in the proton rest frame.\n\nLet’s denote by ε the energy of the photon in the “lab” frame (here, the cosmic rest frame), with\n  ε = 0.001 eV.\nRecall that\n  1 eV = 10⁻⁶ MeV → ε = 10⁻³ × 10⁻⁶ MeV = 10⁻⁹ MeV.\nIf the proton has a relativistic factor γ and velocity β (in units where c = 1), then a head–on collision gives a photon energy in the proton rest frame of\n  E′_γ = γ (1 + β) ε.\nFor ultrarelativistic protons, β ≃ 1, so that\n  E′_γ ≃ 2γ ε.\nThe reaction (γ + p → π⁰ + p) can occur if the photon in the proton rest frame reaches the threshold energy we computed in (a), namely about 145 MeV.

These interactions cause them to lose energy efficiently as they travel through space. Therefore, even if very-high-energy cosmic rays are produced in distant sources, protons with energies above this threshold will lose energy over cosmological distances.

Then the lab time is\n\n  t_lab = (3.0×10⁻³ m)/(0.9957 × 3.0×10⁸ m/s)\n      ≈ 3.0×10⁻³ / (2.9871×10⁸)\n      ≈ 1.003×10⁻¹¹ s.\n\n4. Now, using the time dilation relation to find the proper time:\n\n  τ_proper = t_lab / γ ≈ (1.00×10⁻¹¹ s)/(10.75)\n        ≈ 9.30×10⁻¹³ s.\n\nThus, the D⁰ particle lived about 9.3×10⁻¹³ s in its own rest frame.\n\n────────────────────────────── Step (b): Comparing the decay time distributions ──────────────────────────────\n\nWhen many D⁰ decays are observed, the decay time in the D⁰ rest frame obeys an exponential law. The probability density for a decay at proper time t is\n\n  P(t) = (1/τ) exp(–t/τ),\n\nwhere τ is the mean lifetime of the D⁰ in its rest frame.\n\nNote that the branching ratio (BR) for a particular decay mode tells us the fraction of decays that proceed via that channel. For example:\n• A 1% branching ratio means that only 1 out of 100 decays is through that mode.\n• A 40% branching ratio means 40 out of 100 decays are through that mode.\n\nHowever, the intrinsic time evolution (the exponential decay law) is the same for all decay modes because it is a property of the parent particle. In other words, if you were to collect the proper decay times for each channel, the normalized distribution as a function of t would be\n\n  P(t) = (1/τ) exp(–t/τ)\n\nin both cases. The overall number of decays (normalization) differs, but the shape—the decay constant—is identical.\n\n────────────────────────────── Final Answers ──────────────────────────────\n\n(a) The proper lifetime of the D⁰ particle is approximately 9.3×10⁻¹³ seconds.\n\n(b) In the D⁰ rest frame, all decay channels follow the same exponential distribution with mean lifetime τ; the only difference is that a 1% decay mode will have far fewer events compared to a 40% decay mode, but their time distributions (i.e. exponential slopes) are identical.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\tau_{\\text{proper}} \\approx 9.3\\times10^{-13}\\, \\text{s},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{Both channels follow } P(t)=\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\exp(-t/\\tau) \\text{ in the rest frame, differing only by overall normalization.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\tau_{\\text{proper}} \\approx 9.3\\times10^{-13}\\, \\text{s},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{Both channels follow } P(t)=\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\exp(-t/\\tau) \\text{ in the rest frame, differing only by overall normalization.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\tau_{\\text{proper}} \\approx 9.3\\times10^{-13}\\, \\text{s},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{Both channels follow } P(t)=\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\exp(-t/\\tau) \\text{ in the rest frame, differing only by overall normalization.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\tau_0 = 9.3 \\times 10^{-13} \\, \\text{s}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

In that frame the muon has a fixed momentum given by\n\n  p* = (mₚᵢ² – m_μ²) / (2 mₚᵢ).\n\nIts energy there is\n\n  E* = (mₚᵢ² + m_μ²) / (2 mₚᵢ).\n\nNow, suppose that in the laboratory the pion has a very high momentum p (with p ≫ mₚᵢ, m_μ). If the pion’s four–momentum is (Eₚᵢ, p) with Eₚᵢ ≃ p (since p ≫ mₚᵢ) the Lorentz boost in the pion momentum direction brings the muon with its momentum given by\n  p_μ = γ (p* cosθ* + β E*)\nwhere θ* is the angle (in the pion rest frame) between the muon momentum and the boost direction, β ≃ 1, and γ = Eₚᵢ/mₚᵢ ≃ p/mₚᵢ. The maximum (minimum) muon momentum in the lab is obtained for cosθ* = +1 (–1). Hence\n  p_μ^(max) = (p/mₚᵢ)(E* + p*)\n  p_μ^(min) = (p/mₚᵢ)(E* – p*).\n\nLet us work out these sums:\n• E* + p* = (mₚᵢ² + m_μ² + mₚᵢ² – m_μ²)/(2 mₚᵢ) = (2 mₚᵢ²)/(2 mₚᵢ) = mₚᵢ,\n• E* – p* = [ (mₚᵢ² + m_μ²) – (mₚᵢ² – m_μ²) ]/(2 mₚᵢ) = (2 m_μ²)/(2 mₚᵢ) = m_μ²/mₚᵢ.\n\nThus, we obtain:\n  p_μ^(max) = (p/mₚᵢ) · mₚᵢ = p,\n  p_μ^(min) = (p/mₚᵢ) · (m_μ²/mₚᵢ) = p·(m_μ/mₚᵢ)².\n\nSo the muon momentum lies between\n  p·(m_μ/mₚᵢ)² and p.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPart (b): Muon Helicity in π Decay\n\nIn the decay π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν₁ the pion is a spin–0 particle. (Also note that the weak interaction has a V–A structure.) In the rest frame of the pion the final state must have total angular momentum zero. With the neutrino being massless it has a fixed helicity; in the Standard Model only the “left–handed” neutrino is produced (that is, with helicity –½). To cancel the neutrino’s spin, the muon (which is massive so that its helicity need not be the same as its chirality) must be emitted with its spin oriented in the opposite direction relative to the overall angular momentum balance. In the pion rest frame the muon momentum is opposite to that of the neutrino. Thus, if the neutrino (going, say, in the +z direction) has spin antiparallel to its momentum (–z direction), then the muon (moving in the –z direction) must carry a spin along +z so that its spin is opposite to its momentum (i.e. it has negative helicity). Therefore, the answer is: the muon is produced with negative helicity.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPart (c): Positron Helicity in μ Decay\n\nNow consider the decay\n  μ⁺ → e⁺ + ν₂ + ν̄₃.\nWe are told that ν₂ has negative helicity (i.e. is left–handed) and that ν̄₃ has positive helicity (for an antineutrino the “right–handed” helicity is produced by the V–A weak current). In the muon rest frame the angular momentum must again be conserved. (Detailed kinematics involves a three–body phase space, but the structure of the weak interaction tells us something about the helicity of the charged lepton.) In the Standard Model the weak charged current involves left–handed fields. (Equivalently, it couples to a right–handed anti–lepton.) Hence, the e⁺ emerges with right–handed chirality. For a relativistic massless particle (and approximately so for the positron, since m_e ≪ m_μ) chirality coincides with helicity. Thus the positron has positive helicity.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPart (d): The Conserved Quantum Number\n\nIn these weak decays we have two different families (or “flavors”) of leptons: the muon family (which contains μ and its associated neutrino) and the electron family. The fact that in pion decay the neutrino (ν₁) is “paired” with the muon, while in muon decay ν₂ (and in the complementary mode, ν̄₃) is associated with the electron, is controlled by the conservation of lepton flavor. In other words, there is a muon number (L_μ) and an electron number (L_e) which are individually conserved (apart from possible tiny neutrino–oscillation effects, which we neglect here).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPart (e): Why Is π⁺ → e⁺ + ν_e So Strongly Suppressed?\n\nAlthough the kinematics (phase space) for the decays π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ and π⁺ → e⁺ + ν_e are quite similar, the second decay is observed to occur at a rate that is about 10⁴ times smaller than the muon channel. The essential reason is helicity suppression. In pion decay one must conserve angular momentum and, because the pion is spinless and the weak currents couple only to left–handed fields (and, equivalently, to right–handed anti–fields), the amplitude for producing an electron (with its very small mass) is suppressed by a factor proportional to m_e. (More precisely, one finds that the amplitude is ∝ m_e, so that the decay rate, proportional to the square of the amplitude, gets a suppression factor ∝ m_e². In contrast, the muon’s larger mass makes this suppression much less severe.) Hence, the π⁺ → e⁺ + ν_e mode is helicity suppressed.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The muon momentum in the lab frame is bounded by\n  p_μ^(min) = p·(m_μ/mₚᵢ)² and p_μ^(max) = p.\n\n(b) In π⁺ decay the neutrino is produced with negative helicity forcing the muon to have negative helicity.\n\n(c) In μ⁺ decay, with ν₂ (left–handed) and ν̄₃ (right–handed), the positron comes out with positive helicity.\n\n(d) The association of ν₁ with the muon and of ν₂ (and ν̄₃) with the electron is due to the conservation of the separate lepton numbers (muon and electron flavor).\n\n(e) The π⁺ → e⁺ + ν_e decay is suppressed by the V–A structure of the weak interaction (helicity suppression), which forces the amplitude to be proportional to the small electron mass.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\quad p_\\mu^{\\rm max}=p,\\quad p_\\mu^{\\rm min}=p\\Bigl(\\frac{m_\\mu}{m_\\pi}\\Bigr)^{2}\\,.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}&\\quad\\text{The muon is produced with negative helicity.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}&\\quad\\text{The positron is produced with positive helicity.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}&\\quad\\text{Separate lepton‐flavor (muon and electron) number conservation.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(e)}&\\quad\\text{The }\\pi^+\\to e^++\\nu_e\\text{ mode is helicity suppressed (amplitude }\\propto m_e\\text{),}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{reducing its rate by roughly }10^4\\text{ relative to the muon mode.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\quad p_\\mu^{\\rm max}=p,\\quad p_\\mu^{\\rm min}=p\\Bigl(\\frac{m_\\mu}{m_\\pi}\\Bigr)^{2}\\,.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}&\\quad\\text{The muon is produced with negative helicity.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}&\\quad\\text{The positron is produced with positive helicity.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}&\\quad\\text{Separate lepton‐flavor (muon and electron) number conservation.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(e)}&\\quad\\text{The }\\pi^+\\to e^++\\nu_e\\text{ mode is helicity suppressed (amplitude }\\propto m_e\\text{),}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{reducing its rate by roughly }10^4\\text{ relative to the muon mode.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\quad p_\\mu^{\\rm max}=p,\\quad p_\\mu^{\\rm min}=p\\Bigl(\\frac{m_\\mu}{m_\\pi}\\Bigr)^{2}\\,.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}&\\quad\\text{The muon is produced with negative helicity.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}&\\quad\\text{The positron is produced with positive helicity.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}&\\quad\\text{Separate lepton‐flavor (muon and electron) number conservation.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(e)}&\\quad\\text{The }\\pi^+\\to e^++\\nu_e\\text{ mode is helicity suppressed (amplitude }\\propto m_e\\text{),}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{reducing its rate by roughly }10^4\\text{ relative to the muon mode.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "(p_\\mu)_{\\max} = p + \\frac{m_\\pi^2 -

Now the “physical” amplitudes are obtained by projecting the Nπ state onto the pure I = ½ piece (the ΔI = ½ rule does not allow any admixture of the I = 3/2 channel).

{"id": "atomic/3-32", "solution": "We can determine the quantum numbers of the η⁰ by examining how it is produced and how it decays. Let’s work through the evidence step by step.\n\n───────────────────────────── \n1. Production in π⁻ + p → η⁰ + n\n\nExperiment:\n• A beam of π⁻ is directed at a hydrogen target (protons) in, for example, a bubble chamber or spark chamber experiment. By analyzing the events, one observes that the η⁰ is produced together with a neutron.\n• A detailed partial‐wave analysis shows that near threshold the reaction proceeds predominantly via s‐wave production (i.e. zero orbital angular momentum, L = 0). \n\nConsequence:\n• Since no angular momentum is provided by orbital motion (L = 0) and angular momentum is conserved, the intrinsic spins of the participating particles must combine appropriately. The pion has spin 0 and the proton spin ½. In the final state the neutron is ½ so the s‐wave nature of the production suggests that the η⁰ itself has spin 0 (or else one would see a more complicated angular distribution).\n• The absence of a similarly accessible reaction such as π⁻ + p → η⁻ + p (which would be the charge partner if the η belonged to an isovector multiplet) tells us that there is no charged partner. In conventional multiplets an isovector would have three charge states (like the π⁻, π⁰, π⁺). Therefore it is natural to conclude that the η⁰ has isospin I = 0. \n• The overall charge is clearly conserved in π⁻ (charge –1) + p (charge +1) → η⁰ + n (charge 0 + 0), so the η must be neutral.\n\n───────────────────────────── \n2. Decay Modes of the η⁰\n\nExperiment:\n• In high energy experiments (using electromagnetic calorimeters and tracking detectors) one studies the decays of the produced η⁰ by reconstructing its invariant mass from decay products.\n• It is found that the η⁰ decays primarily into 2γ (38% of the time) and 3π (30%), while the 2π decay mode is highly suppressed (<0.15%).\n\nConsequence:\n• The significant two‐photon decay is particularly telling. For a particle to decay into two photons, it must obey the Landau–Yang theorem which forbids a spin 1 state from decaying into two identical massless bosons (photons). Combined with the s‐wave production information, this supports the conclusion that the η⁰ has spin 0.\n• The relative suppression of the 2π decay mode (which would be a strong decay if allowed) and the allowed 3π decay suggest that some decays are suppressed by symmetry. In particular, for a pseudoscalar meson, parity and isospin conservation affect which decay modes are available. The observed decays are consistent with the η⁰ being a pseudoscalar (Jᴾ = 0⁻).\n\n───────────────────────────── \n3. Rest Mass Measurement\n\nExperiment:\n• The mass of the η⁰ is obtained by reconstructing the invariant mass of its decay products (for example, the two photon decay channel). The kinematics (energy–momentum conservation) are used to precisely determine that the rest mass is approximately 548.8 MeV.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nInference Summary\n\n• The s‐wave production indicates that the intrinsic spin of the η⁰ is 0.\n• The two–photon decay, by virtue of the Landau–Yang theorem, further excludes spin 1 and strongly supports a spin 0 assignment.\n• The non‐observation of any charged counterpart (as would be required if the η belonged to an isovector multiplet) indicates that its isospin is I = 0.\n• Charge conservation in production (π⁻ + p → η⁰ + n) confirms that the η is neutral.\n• Its decay patterns (and the blocking of 2π decay) are consistent with a pseudoscalar nature (Jᴾ = 0⁻).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer\n\nThus, on the basis of these experimental facts, we conclude that the η⁰ has a spin of 0, is an isosinglet (I = 0), and carries zero electric charge. \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{S = 0,\\ I = 0,\\ Q = 0}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["S = 0,\\ I = 0,\\ Q = 0"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "S = 0,\\ I = 0,\\ Q = 0", "expr2": "J(\\eta^0) = 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "0", "expr2": "0"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Equivalently, if one tries to transform to the center‐of-mass frame of the e⁻–e⁺ pair, one finds that the photon, being massless, does not have a rest frame that could match that of the e⁻–e⁺ system.\n\nThus, by energy–momentum conservation, the production of an e⁻–e⁺ pair from a single free photon is not allowed. In practice, a third particle (usually a nucleus) must be present to absorb some momentum so that both energy and momentum are conserved.\n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nStep (b): Estimating the Recoil Kinetic Energy of a Lead Nucleus\n\nNow suppose the photon interacts in the vicinity of a heavy nucleus (for example, a lead nucleus), which absorbs the required recoil. Near threshold, the photon energy required for pair production is essentially the minimum needed to create the rest masses of the electron and positron:\n  Eγ ≥ 2m_ec² = 1.022 MeV.\n\nHowever, because the nucleus (of mass M) recoils to conserve momentum, one might worry that some energy is “lost” to give it kinetic energy. Let’s estimate this recoil energy.\n\nFor a photon of energy Eγ just at threshold, the magnitude of its momentum is\n  |p₍γ₎| = Eγ/c.\nThe nucleus, balancing the momentum, must acquire momentum p_N ≈ Eγ/c. Its recoil kinetic energy is approximately given (in the nonrelativistic limit) by\n  K_N ≈ p_N²/(2M) = Eγ²/(2M c²).\n\nUsing Eγ ≈ 1.022 MeV and taking an approximate mass for a lead nucleus, we note that lead has a mass number A ≈ 208. Thus,\n  M ≈ 208 · m_p ≈ 208 × 938 MeV/c² ≈ 195000 MeV/c².\nNow, the recoil kinetic energy is then calculated as:\n  K_N ≈ (1.022 MeV)² / (2 × 195000 MeV)\n    ≈ (1.044 MeV²) / (390000 MeV)\n    ≈ 2.68 × 10⁻⁶ MeV = 2.68 eV.\n\nSince 2.68 eV is utterly negligible compared with 1.022 MeV (about 1 part in 400,000), we are justified in neglecting the recoil kinetic energy of the nucleus when estimating the photon’s threshold energy for pair production.\n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nFinal Answer:\n\n(a) A free photon cannot produce an electron–positron pair because conservation of four-momentum requires a nonzero invariant mass for the produced system (at least 4mₑ²), while the photon has zero invariant mass; hence, the process is forbidden unless another particle (such as a nucleus) is present to absorb momentum.\n\n(b) If the nucleus is a lead nucleus (M ≈ 195000 MeV/c²), then for a photon of energy about 1.022 MeV the recoil kinetic energy is Kₙ ≈ Eγ²/(2Mc²) ≈ 2.68 eV, proving that the recoil energy is negligible compared to the threshold energy.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\text{Energy–momentum conservation forbids the process } \\gamma \\to e^- + e^+ \\text{ in free space because } \\\\\n&\\quad 0 = (p_{e^-}+p_{e^+})^2 \\ge 4m_e^2.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{For a lead nucleus (}M\\approx 195000\\,\\text{MeV/c}^2\\text{),}\\\\\n&\\quad K_N \\approx \\frac{(1.022\\,\\text{MeV})^2}{2M} \\approx 2.68\\,\\text{eV, which is negligible.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\text{Energy–momentum conservation forbids the process } \\gamma \\to e^- + e^+ \\text{ in free space because } \\\\\n&\\quad 0 = (p_{e^-}+p_{e^+})^2 \\ge 4m_e^2.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{For a lead nucleus (}M\\approx 195000\\,\\text{MeV/c}^2\\text{),}\\\\\n&\\quad K_N \\approx \\frac{(1.022\\,\\text{MeV})^2}{2M} \\approx 2.68\\,\\text{eV, which is negligible.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\text{Energy–momentum conservation forbids the process } \\gamma \\to e^- + e^+ \\text{ in free space because } \\\\\n&\\quad 0 = (p_{e^-}+p_{e^+})^2 \\ge 4m_e^2.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{For a lead nucleus (}M\\approx 195000\\,\\text{MeV/c}^2\\text{),}\\\\\n&\\quad K_N \\approx \\frac{(1.022\\,\\text{MeV})^2}{2M} \\approx 2.68\\,\\text{eV, which is negligible.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{Pair production by a single isolated photon is not possible because energy and momentum cannot both be conserved.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\text{Energy–momentum conservation forbids the process } \\gamma \\to e^- + e^+ \\text{ in free space because } \\\\\n&\\quad 0 = (p_{e^-}+p_{e^+})^2 \\ge 4m_e^2.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{For a lead nucleus (}M\\approx 195000\\,\\text{MeV/c}^2\\text{),}\\\\\n&\\quad K_N \\approx \\frac{(1.022\\,\\text{MeV})^2}{2M} \\approx 2.68\\,\\text{eV, which is negligible.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "T_{\\text{Pb}} \\approx 2.7 \\times 10^{-6} \\times E_\\gamma"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "atomic/1-7", "solution": "We analyze each part step by step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Qualitative changes in the first ionization energies\n\n• For hydrogen (H, Z = 1): It has only one electron. In the Bohr model this is bound by −(1)²·13.6 eV, i.e. 13.6 eV in magnitude.  \n• For helium (He, Z = 2): Although it is a two‐electron system (so electron–electron repulsions partially reduce the effective nuclear charge for each electron), its nucleus with Z = 2 attracts the electrons more strongly. As a result, the first electron is more tightly bound than in H, leading to a higher first ionization energy (24.6 eV).  \n• For lithium (Li, Z = 3): Its electronic configuration is 1s² 2s¹. The first ionization energy corresponds to removing the lone 2s electron. This outer electron is shielded by the two inner 1s electrons and so “sees” only a small effective nuclear charge. Thus, it is much less tightly bound (5.4 eV) than the electrons in H or He.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Second ionization energy of helium\n\nAfter the removal of the first electron from helium, we are left with He⁺. This is a hydrogen-like ion with one electron and a nuclear charge of Z = 2. For a hydrogen-like system the energy of the n-th state is given by  \n  Eₙ = –(Z²/n²)·13.6 eV.  \nFor the ground state (n = 1), we have  \n  E₁ = –(2²/1²)·13.6 eV = –4·13.6 eV = –54.4 eV.\n\nTherefore, the energy required to remove the second electron (i.e. to ionize He⁺) is 54.4 eV.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Dependence of Sodium’s n = 3 energy levels on l\n\nIn a hydrogen atom (one electron) all orbitals with the same principal quantum number n are degenerate (i.e. have the same energy), regardless of l. However, in multi‐electron atoms like sodium, electron–electron interactions and the resulting screening and penetration effects lift this degeneracy. \n\n• Electrons in s orbitals (l = 0) are able to penetrate very close to the nucleus. This means that a 3s electron in sodium experiences a much stronger attractive Coulomb potential (less shielded by inner electrons) and is more tightly bound (energy –5.1 eV).  \n• Electrons in p orbitals (l = 1) penetrate less than s electrons and therefore experience a slightly lower effective nuclear charge, resulting in an intermediate binding energy (–3.0 eV).  \n• Electrons in d orbitals (l = 2) are even less penetrating and see an even more shielded nuclear charge, so they are the least bound among these (energy –1.5 eV).\n\nThus, the energy depends on l because in a multi‐electron atom the angular momentum of the valence electron determines how close to the nucleus it can get (its “penetration”) and thus how strongly it is bound.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The first ionization energy increases from H to He because the nuclear charge increases so that even with electron–electron repulsion, the electrons in He are more strongly bound than in H. In Li, however, the electron removed is in a higher shell (2s) that is well shielded by the inner electrons, making it much less bound.\n\n(b) The second ionization energy of He is 54.4 eV because after the first electron is removed, the remaining electron in He⁺ (a hydrogenlike ion with Z = 2) requires 4·13.6 eV = 54.4 eV to remove.\n\n(c) In sodium, the energies of the n = 3 states depend on l because electrons in different orbitals penetrate to different extents toward the nucleus. The s electron (l = 0) penetrates best (is most tightly bound), while the d electron (l = 2) is more shielded, leading to higher (less negative) energy.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\; \\text{From H to He, the increased nuclear charge makes the electrons more tightly bound (despite repulsions), while in Li the 2s electron is very weakly bound due to shielding by the inner electrons.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}&\\; E_I^{(2)}(\\text{He}) = 54.4\\,\\text{eV.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}&\\; \\text{The splitting of the n=3 levels arises because orbitals with lower } l \\text{ (more penetration) experience a higher effective nuclear charge than those with higher } l.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\; \\text{From H to He, the increased nuclear charge makes the electrons more tightly bound (despite repulsions), while in Li the 2s electron is very weakly bound due to shielding by the inner electrons.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}&\\; E_I^{(2)}(\\text{He}) = 54.4\\,\\text{eV.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}&\\; \\text{The splitting of the n=3 levels arises because orbitals with lower } l \\text{ (more penetration) experience a higher effective nuclear charge than those with higher } l.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\; \\text{From H to He, the increased nuclear charge makes the electrons more tightly bound (despite repulsions), while in Li the 2s electron is very weakly bound due to shielding by the inner electrons.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}&\\; E_I^{(2)}(\\text{He}) = 54.4\\,\\text{eV.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}&\\; \\text{The splitting of the n=3 levels arises because orbitals with lower } l \\text{ (more penetration) experience a higher effective nuclear charge than those with higher } l.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{The ionization energy increases from H to He due to increased nuclear charge.

In part (a) we couple ordinary angular momenta, while in part (b) we use the same ideas to “couple” isospins and then relate Clebsch–Gordan (CG) factors to reaction cross‐sections.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (a): Coupling j₁ = 1 and j₂ = 1/2 to yield J = 3/2, with M = m₁ + m₂ = 1/2\n\nFor an angular momentum j = 1 we have m₁ = 1, 0, –1 and for j = 1/2 we have m₂ = 1/2 and –1/2.

(The isospin projections, I₃, are: for the pion, π⁺ has I₃ = +1, π⁰ has I₃ = 0, and π⁻ has I₃ = –1; for the nucleon, p has I₃ = +1/2, n has I₃ = –1/2.) When a pion and a nucleon interact, the total isospin may be I = 3/2 or 1/2. In the energy region corresponding to a resonance, only one of these two channels is assumed to dominate. (For example, the Δ resonance has I = 3/2 while an N* state would have I = 1/2.)\n\nLet us denote the reactions as\n\n  (1) π⁺ p → π⁺ p,\n  (2) π⁻ p → π⁻ p,\n  (3) π⁻ p → π⁰ n.\n\nWe next analyze each reaction in the two cases: first when only the I = 3/2 channel is active (Δ resonance) and then when only the I = 1/2 channel is active (N* resonance).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nCase 1. I = 3/2 Resonance (Δ)\n\nWe need to “project” the physical initial (or final) state onto the total isospin state |I, I₃⟩. For a given physical reaction the amplitude is proportional to the CG coefficient between the state labeled by the pion and nucleon quantum numbers and the total state |I, I₃⟩; then the cross section (or probability) is proportional to the square of that coefficient.\n\nLet us look at the three reactions:\n\n1. π⁺ p:\n Here, the isospin states are:\n  π⁺: |1, +1⟩     \n  p:  |1/2, +1/2⟩.\n Thus the combined state has I₃ = +1 + +1/2 = +3/2.\nBut note that for I = 1/2 there is no state with I₃ = +3/2, so the only possibility is I = 3/2. In this case the state |I=3/2, I₃=+3/2⟩ is uniquely given by the π⁺ p combination. (Its CG coefficient is 1.) Hence the amplitude is “1” (up to an overall common factor).\n\n2. π⁻ p:\n Here,\n  π⁻: |1, –1⟩,\n  p:  |1/2, +1/2⟩,\nso I₃ = –1 + (+1/2) = –1/2.\nNow, the state |I=3/2,–1/2⟩ is given by the expansion\n  |3/2, –1/2⟩ = √(1/3) |1, –1⟩ |1/2, +1/2⟩ + √(2/3) |1, 0⟩ |1/2, –1/2⟩.\nThus, the π⁻ p state appears with a CG coefficient of √(1/3). (The other part does not contribute because the π and nucleon quantum numbers are fixed.) Therefore, the amplitude for π⁻p in the Δ channel is proportional to √(1/3) and the cross section is proportional to 1/3.\n\n3. π⁻ p → π⁰ n:\n For the final state, we have\n  π⁰: |1, 0⟩,\n  n:  |1/2, –1/2⟩,\nso that I₃ = 0 + (–1/2) = –1/2.\nNow, express |1, 0⟩ |1/2, –1/2⟩ in the total isospin basis. One finds\n  |3/2, –1/2⟩ = √(2/3) |1, 0⟩ |1/2, –1/2⟩ + √(1/3) |1, –1⟩ |1/2, +1/2⟩.\nThus the coefficient for the π⁰ n part is √(2/3), so that the amplitude squared is 2/3.\n\nThus, if only the Δ (I = 3/2) state contributes, the cross‐sections (ignoring an overall common factor) are proportional to:\n σ(π⁺ p) : σ(π⁻ p) : σ(π⁻ p → π⁰ n) = 1 : 1/3 : 2/3.\nIt is convenient to multiply through by 3, giving the ratio as\n  3 : 1 : 2.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nCase 2. I = 1/2 Resonance (N*)\n\nNow we assume that only the I = 1/2 state contributes. The relevant projections are done using the CG coefficients for I = 1/2.\n\nWrite the expansions for states with I₃ = –1/2. Standard formulas give (up to overall phases that do not affect the cross‐sections):\n\nFor the state |1/2, –1/2⟩, one has\n  |1/2, –1/2⟩ = √(2/3) |1, –1⟩ |1/2, +1/2⟩ – √(1/3) |1, 0⟩ |1/2, –1/2⟩.\nThus:\n\n1. π⁺ p:\n Here the combined state is π⁺ p with I₃ = +1 + +1/2 = +3/2. But no I = 1/2 state can have I₃ = +3/2. Therefore, the amplitude for π⁺ p in the N* channel vanishes.\n\n2. π⁻ p:\n For the initial state, \n  π⁻: |1, –1⟩,\n  p:  |1/2, +1/2⟩,\nwith I₃ = –1/2. In the I = 1/2 expansion above the π⁻ p piece appears with a coefficient √(2/3). Thus the amplitude squared is 2/3.\n\n3. π⁻ p → π⁰ n:\n For the final state,\n  π⁰: |1, 0⟩,\n  n:  |1/2, –1/2⟩,\nwith I₃ = 0 + (–1/2)= –1/2. This state appears in the I = 1/2 combination with coefficient –√(1/3) (the sign is irrelevant for the cross section), so the amplitude squared is 1/3.\n\nThus, for the N* (I = 1/2) dominance we have the cross‐sections proportional to:\n σ(π⁺ p) : σ(π⁻ p) : σ(π⁻ p → π⁰ n) = 0 : 2/3 : 1/3.\nMultiplying by 3 gives:\n  0 : 2 : 1.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) For j₁ = 1 and j₂ = 1/2 coupling to |3/2, 1/2⟩, the Clebsch–Gordan decomposition is:\n  |3/2, 1/2⟩ = √(1/3) |1, 1⟩ |1/2, –1/2⟩ + √(2/3) |1, 0⟩ |1/2, 1/2⟩.\n\n(b) When only one isospin resonance contributes:\n • For Δ (I = 3/2):\n  σ(π⁺ p) : σ(π⁻ p) : σ(π⁻ p → π⁰ n) = 3 : 1 : 2.\n • For N* (I = 1/2):\n  σ(π⁺ p) : σ(π⁻ p) : σ(π⁻ p → π⁰ n) = 0 : 2 : 1.\n\nWe now box the final answer.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & |3/2,\\,1/2\\rangle = \\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{3}}\\,|1,\\,1\\rangle\\,|1/2,\\,-1/2\\rangle \n+\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}}\\,|1,\\,0\\rangle\\,|1/2,\\,1/2\\rangle,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{For the }\\Delta\\; (I=3/2):\\quad \\sigma(\\pi^+p):\\sigma(\\pi^-p):\\sigma(\\pi^-p\\to\\pi^0n)=3:1:2,\\\\[2mm]\n& \\text{For the }N^*\\; (I=1/2):\\quad \\sigma(\\pi^+p):\\sigma(\\pi^-p):\\sigma(\\pi^-p\\to\\pi^0n)=0:2:1.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & |3/2,\\,1/2\\rangle = \\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{3}}\\,|1,\\,1\\rangle\\,|1/2,\\,-1/2\\rangle \n+\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}}\\,|1,\\,0\\rangle\\,|1/2,\\,1/2\\rangle,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{For the }\\Delta\\; (I=3/2):\\quad \\sigma(\\pi^+p):\\sigma(\\pi^-p):\\sigma(\\pi^-p\\to\\pi^0n)=3:1:2,\\\\[2mm]\n& \\text{For the }N^*\\; (I=1/2):\\quad \\sigma(\\pi^+p):\\sigma(\\pi^-p):\\sigma(\\pi^-p\\to\\pi^0n)=0:2:1.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & |3/2,\\,1/2\\rangle = \\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{3}}\\,|1,\\,1\\rangle\\,|1/2,\\,-1/2\\rangle \n+\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}}\\,|1,\\,0\\rangle\\,|1/2,\\,1/2\\rangle,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{For the }\\Delta\\; (I=3/2):\\quad \\sigma(\\pi^+p):\\sigma(\\pi^-p):\\sigma(\\pi^-p\\to\\pi^0n)=3:1:2,\\\\[2mm]\n& \\text{For the }N^*\\; (I=1/2):\\quad \\sigma(\\pi^+p):\\sigma(\\pi^-p):\\sigma(\\pi^-p\\to\\pi^0n)=0:2:1.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\left|\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right\\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} |1, 0\\rangle \\left|\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right\\rangle + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} |1, 1\\rangle \\left|\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\rangle"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & |3/2,\\,1/2\\rangle = \\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{3}}\\,|1,\\,1\\rangle\\,|1/2,\\,-1/2\\rangle \n+\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}}\\,|1,\\,0\\rangle\\,|1/2,\\,1/2\\rangle,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{For the }\\Delta\\; (I=3/2):\\quad \\sigma(\\pi^+p):\\sigma(\\pi^-p):\\sigma(\\pi^-p\\to\\pi^0n)=3:1:2,\\\\[2mm]\n& \\text{For the }N^*\\; (I=1/2):\\quad \\sigma(\\pi^+p):\\sigma(\\pi^-p):\\sigma(\\pi^-p\\to\\pi^0n)=0:2:1.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\sigma_1 : \\sigma_2 : \\sigma_3 = 9 : 1 : 2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & |3/2,\\,1/2\\rangle = \\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{3}}\\,|1,\\,1\\rangle\\,|1/2,\\,-1/2\\rangle \n+\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}}\\,|1,\\,0\\rangle\\,|1/2,\\,1/2\\rangle,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{For the }\\Delta\\; (I=3/2):\\quad \\sigma(\\pi^+p):\\sigma(\\pi^-p):\\sigma(\\pi^-p\\to\\pi^0n)=3:1:2,\\\\[2mm]\n& \\text{For the }N^*\\; (I=1/2):\\quad \\sigma(\\pi^+p):\\sigma(\\pi^-p):\\sigma(\\pi^-p\\to\\pi^0n)=0:2:1.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\sigma_1 : \\sigma_2 : \\sigma_3 = 0 : 2 : 1"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

A proton has\n  Electric charge Q = +1,\n  Baryon number B = +1, and\n  Strangeness S = 0.\n\nThus, the two‐proton initial state has total\n  Q = +1 + +1 = +2,\n  B = 1 + 1 = 2, and\n  S = 0.\n\nIn the final state the particles are H, K⁺, and K⁺. The charged kaon, K⁺, is composed of u and anti‐s quarks. (Recall: in the usual convention the s–quark has S = –1, so the anti–s has S = +1.) Therefore, each K⁺ has\n  Q = +1,\n  B = 0  (since mesons have vanishing baryon number), and\n  S = +1.\n\nSince two K⁺’s together have\n  Total charge = +1 + +1 = +2,\n  Total baryon number = 0, and\n  Total strangeness = +1 + +1 = +2,\nwe deduce from conservation of these quantum numbers that H must have\n\n  Charge: Q_H = (initial Q) – (2) = +2 – 2 = 0,\n  Baryon number: B_H = 2 – 0 = 2,\n  Strangeness: S_H = (initial S) – (2) = 0 – 2 = –2.\n\nThus, H is a state with zero charge, baryon number 2, and strangeness –2.\n\nSince a single baryon has baryon number 1 and is made of three quarks, a state having baryon number 2 must contain essentially two baryons’ worth of quarks; that is, it must be a dibaryon. In a quark picture, H must contain 6 quarks. Moreover, to get S = –2, two of these six quarks must be strange (s) quarks (each s quark having S = –1).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Find the threshold beam momentum to produce H\n\nIn the laboratory the target proton is at rest and the beam proton has momentum p. At threshold the final particles are produced with no relative motion in the overall center‐of–mass (or, equivalently, their kinetic energies in the CM are zero). In that situation the total CM energy must equal the sum of the rest masses in the final state:\n\n  √s = m_H + 2m_K\n\nWe are told m_H = 2150 MeV, and we take for the charged kaon m_K ≃ 494 MeV. Therefore,\n\n  m_H + 2m_K = 2150 + 2×494 = 2150 + 988 = 3138 MeV.\n\nNow for a beam proton (mass m_p) hitting a proton at rest, the Mandelstam variable s is given by\n\n  s = m_p² + m_p² + 2m_pE_beam = 2m_p² + 2m_pE_beam,\n   where E_beam = √(p² + m_p²).\n\nWe set\n\n  √(2m_p² + 2m_pE_beam) = 3138 MeV.\n\nSquaring both sides gives\n\n  2m_p² + 2m_pE_beam = (3138)².\n\nSolve for E_beam:\n\n  E_beam = [ (3138)² – 2m_p² ] / (2m_p).\n\nTaking m_p ≃ 938 MeV, we first compute\n\n  2m_p² = 2 × (938)².\n\nSince (938)² ≃ 880,000 MeV² (more precisely 879,844 MeV²), we have\n\n  2m_p² ≃ 1,759,688 MeV².\n\nAlso, (3138)² is approximately\n\n  3138² ≃ 9,847,044 MeV².\n\nThus,\n\n  E_beam ≃ (9,847,044 – 1,759,688) / (2×938)\n       ≃ 8,087,356 / 1876 ≃ 4310 MeV.\n\nNow, the beam momentum is then found from\n\n  p = √(E_beam² – m_p²).\n\nSo\n\n  p ≃ √(4310² – 938²) MeV\n   = √(18,580,000 – 880,000) MeV\n   = √(17,700,000) MeV\n   ≈ 4200 MeV (or 4.2 GeV).\n\nThus the minimum beam momentum is approximately 4.2 GeV/c.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Consideration of possible decay modes of H\n\nThe state H has quantum numbers B = 2 and S = –2. In order to decay by the strong interaction, the final states must have the same total baryon number and strangeness. A natural possibility for a strong decay is H → Λ + Λ since each Λ (with quark content uds) has B = 1 and S = –1. However, note that\n\n  m(Λ) ≃ 1116 MeV  →  2m(Λ) ≃ 2232 MeV.\n\nSince the predicted mass of H is m_H = 2150 MeV, it lies below the ΛΛ threshold. Other possible strong decays (such as into Λ + Σ, etc.) require even more mass. Therefore, if m_H = 2150 MeV is correct, none of the strong-interaction decay modes (which conserve flavor exactly) are energetically allowed.\n\nSince strong decays are forbidden, H must decay via the weak interaction. In weak decays the flavor changes (so that strangeness is not conserved) and the available phase space is different. Such decays typically have much longer lifetimes than strong decays. For example, one might expect a weak decay of H to eventually lead to final states containing nonstrange baryons (nucleons) and pions. A plausible weak channel might be one in which one of the s quarks decays (s→ u plus a lepton pair or via hadronic channels) and eventually the six-quark state “falls apart” into final states such as\n\n  H → p + p + π⁻ + (additional light mesons)\n    or\n  H → p + n + π⁰   (etc.).\n\nEssentially, H would decay with a timescale characteristic of weak decays, and the final states would show the typical signatures of ΔS = 1 transitions. (The precise modes would depend on the dynamics of the weak decay of a six-quark system.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n(a) H must have electric charge Q = 0, baryon number B = 2 and strangeness S = –2; it is a dibaryon and therefore contains 6 quarks.\n \n(b) The beam proton must have momentum p ≈ 4.2 GeV/c (obtained from √[2m_p² + 2m_pE_beam] = m_H + 2m_K).\n \n(c) Because 2150 MeV is below the strong-decay threshold (in particular, below 2m(Λ) ≃ 2232 MeV), H cannot decay by strong interactions and must decay by the weak interaction, leading to relatively long lifetimes and final states that typically include nucleons and pions resulting from ΔS = 1 decays.\n\n \n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\textbf{(a)} \\; Q_H = 0,\\quad B_H = 2,\\quad S_H = -2,\\quad \\text{and H is a six‐quark (dibaryon) state.} \\\\\n&\\textbf{(b)} \\; p_{\\text{min}} \\approx 4.2\\,\\text{GeV}/c. \\\\\n&\\textbf{(c)} \\; \\text{Since } m_H = 2150\\text{ MeV is below the strong-decay thresholds (e.g. } H \\to \\Lambda\\Lambda\\text{), H decays only weakly.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&\\textbf{(a)} \\; Q_H = 0,\\quad B_H = 2,\\quad S_H = -2,\\quad \\text{and H is a six‐quark (dibaryon) state.} \\\\\n&\\textbf{(b)} \\; p_{\\text{min}} \\approx 4.2\\,\\text{GeV}/c. \\\\\n&\\textbf{(c)} \\; \\text{Since } m_H = 2150\\text{ MeV is below the strong-decay thresholds (e.g. } H \\to \\Lambda\\Lambda\\text{), H decays only weakly.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\textbf{(a)} \\; Q_H = 0,\\quad B_H = 2,\\quad S_H = -2,\\quad \\text{and H is a six‐quark (dibaryon) state.} \\\\\n&\\textbf{(b)} \\; p_{\\text{min}} \\approx 4.2\\,\\text{GeV}/c. \\\\\n&\\textbf{(c)} \\; \\text{Since } m_H = 2150\\text{ MeV is below the strong-decay thresholds (e.g. } H \\to \\Lambda\\Lambda\\text{), H decays only weakly.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "Q = 0, \\, S = -2, \\, B = 2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Therefore, in the laboratory frame:\n• The photon with energy ε moving in the +x direction has four‐momentum p₁ = (ε, +ε).\n• The photon with energy E moving in the –x direction has four‐momentum p₂ = (E, –E).\n\nThe total energy and momentum in the lab frame are\n  E_tot = ε + E\n  p_tot = ε – E     (note the sign; since one photon is moving in the opposite direction, the net momentum is the difference of the energies).\n\nWe now wish to perform a Lorentz boost along the x-axis with velocity β so that in the new frame (the “center‐of-momentum” frame) the total momentum is zero. Under a boost, the energy and momentum transform as follows:\n  E' = γ (E_tot – β p_tot)  and p' = γ (p_tot – β E_tot),\nwhere γ = 1/√(1 – β²).\n\nWe set p' = 0 to find the required boost speed:\n  γ (p_tot – β E_tot) = 0  ⟹  p_tot – β E_tot = 0.\n\nSubstitute p_tot and E_tot:\n  (ε – E) – β (ε + E) = 0.\n\nSolving for β:\n  –β (ε + E) = –(E – ε)\n  β (ε + E) = E – ε\n  β = (E – ε)/(E + ε).\n\nThus, the necessary boost velocity is\n  β = (E – ε)/(E + ε).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Minimum E for Pair Production\n\nFor an electron–positron (e⁻e⁺) pair to be produced from the collision of the two photons, the total energy in the center‐of-momentum frame must at least equal the rest mass energy of the pair. In natural units (c = 1), the threshold condition is:\n  √s ≥ 2mₑ,\nwhere mₑ is the electron rest mass and s is the Mandelstam invariant (the square of the total four–momentum).\n\nSince the invariant s is the same in all frames, we compute it in the lab frame:\n  s = (p₁ + p₂)² = (ε + E)² – (ε – E)².\nExpanding the squares:\n  (ε + E)² = ε² + 2εE + E²,\n  (ε – E)² = ε² – 2εE + E².\n\nThus,\n  s = (ε² + 2εE + E²) – (ε² – 2εE + E²) = 4εE.\n\nThe threshold condition becomes:\n  √(4εE) ≥ 2mₑ ⟹ 2√(εE) ≥ 2mₑ ⟹ √(εE) ≥ mₑ.\n\nSquaring both sides gives:\n  εE ≥ mₑ²  ⟹  E ≥ mₑ²/ε.\n\nIf we take ε = 1 eV and use the electron rest mass mₑ ≈ 511 keV = 5.11×10⁵ eV, then\n  mₑ² ≈ (5.11×10⁵ eV)² ≈ 2.61×10¹¹ eV².\nSo,\n  E ≥ (2.61×10¹¹ eV²) / (1 eV) = 2.61×10¹¹ eV.\n\nThus, the photon with energy E must have at least approximately 2.61×10¹¹ eV (or about 261 GeV) in order to produce an electron–positron pair upon colliding with a 1 eV photon.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) β = (E – ε)/(E + ε)\n\n(b) The threshold energy is E ≥ mₑ²/ε.

{"id": "atomic/3-17", "solution": "We will show that each of the “reactions” or “decays” is forbidden either by a conservation law (of baryon number, strangeness, etc.), by kinematics (the final particles have too high a mass) or by the structure of the weak interactions (for example, because a ΔS = 2 transition is very strongly suppressed).\n\nLet’s consider each case step by step.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nPart (a): Production Reactions \n───────────────────────────── \n\n1. p + p → K⁺ + Σ⁺\n\n• In the initial state the two protons have baryon number 1 each, so the total baryon number is 2.  \n• In the final state, however, the kaon K⁺ is a meson (baryon number 0) and Σ⁺ is a baryon (baryon number 1).  \n• Baryon number would then change from 2 to 1.  \n• Baryon number conservation is a strict rule in all known interactions (barring speculative baryon–number–violating processes); hence this reaction cannot occur.\n\n2. p + n → Λ⁰ + Σ⁺\n\n• Initial baryon number: proton (1) + neutron (1) = 2; final baryon number: Λ⁰ (1) + Σ⁺ (1) = 2. So baryon number is fine.  \n• Strangeness: the proton and neutron have S = 0. However, in the final state Λ⁰ and Σ⁺ each carry strangeness S = –1 (they are hyperons). So the net strangeness in the final state is –2 while the initial net strangeness is 0.  \n• In strong (and electromagnetic) reactions strangeness is conserved. In weak processes strangeness can change but the probability is many orders of magnitude smaller. Moreover, the production of two units of net strangeness without compensating “anti‐strange” particles is not allowed in strong interactions.  \n• Thus this reaction is not observed.\n\n3. p + n → Ξ⁰ + p\n\n• Baryon number: initial (1 + 1 = 2) and final (Ξ⁰ is a baryon and the extra proton makes 1 + 1 = 2) are conserved.  \n• Strangeness: Ξ⁰ (sometimes called cascade zero) has strangeness S = –2 (its quark content is ssu or ssd depending on charge, but here S = –2). The proton has S = 0. Thus the final state has net strangeness –2 whereas the initial state had S = 0.  \n• Again, the strong interaction conserves strangeness, so such ΔS = –2 reaction is forbidden.\n\n4. p + n → Ξ⁻ + K⁺ + Σ⁺\n\n• Baryon number: initial (2) equals final (Ξ⁻ and Σ⁺ are baryons → 1 + 1 = 2; K⁺ is a meson → 0).  \n• Strangeness: Now, Ξ⁻ has S = –2, Σ⁺ has S = –1 and K⁺ has S = +1. Adding these gives (–2) + (–1) + (+1) = –2. The initial state S = 0, so there is a net change ΔS = –2.  \n• As before, creating a net strangeness of –2 without a compensating +2 is not allowed in the strong interaction so this reaction is not observed.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nPart (b): Decay Processes \n───────────────────────────── \n\n1. Ξ⁰ → Σ⁰ + Λ⁰\n\n• Mass and kinematics:  \n – Typical masses are approximately: m(Ξ⁰) ≈ 1315 MeV, m(Σ⁰) ≈ 1193 MeV, m(Λ⁰) ≈ 1116 MeV.  \n – The sum of final state masses would be 1193 + 1116 = 2309 MeV, much heavier than the Ξ⁰.  \n• Even though baryon number and strangeness balance (Ξ⁰ has S = –2; Σ⁰ and Λ⁰ each have S = –1, so net S = –2), the decay is kinematically forbidden. There is simply not enough mass/energy in Ξ⁰ to produce the two final baryons.\n\n2. Σ⁺ → Λ⁰ + K⁺\n\n• Baryon number: Σ⁺ and Λ⁰ are baryons, and K⁺ is a meson. Thus baryon number conservation is satisfied (1 → 1 + 0).  \n• Strangeness: Both Σ⁺ and Λ⁰ have strangeness S = –1, while K⁺ has S = +1. Thus the final state has net strangeness (–1 + 1 = 0) while the initial state has S = –1.  \n• In addition, consider kinematics:  \n – m(Σ⁺) ≈ 1189 MeV, m(Λ⁰) ≈ 1116 MeV, m(K⁺) ≈ 494 MeV.  \n – The sum of final state masses is 1116 + 494 = 1610 MeV, which is greater than m(Σ⁺).  \n• So the decay is both kinematically forbidden and would violate strangeness conservation if it were mediated by the strong or electromagnetic interaction. (A weak process that changes strangeness by one unit could in principle occur, but kinematics is the first problem here.)\n\n3. Ξ⁻ → n + π⁻\n\n• Baryon number: Ξ⁻ (1) decays into a neutron (1) and a pion (0), so baryon number is conserved.  \n• Strangeness: Ξ⁻ has S = –2. Neutron and pion have S = 0, so ΔS = –2.  \n• In weak decays it is typical to have ΔS = ±1. A ΔS = ±2 transition is highly suppressed because it can only occur via a second‐order weak process (similar to K⁰–K⁰bar mixing) and even then there is an almost complete cancellation between different contributions.  \n• Thus, even though it is kinematically allowed (roughly, m(Ξ⁻) ≈ 1321 MeV, m(n) ≈ 940 MeV, m(π⁻) ≈ 140 MeV so 940 + 140 = 1080 MeV < 1321 MeV), the decay does not occur at an observable rate.\n\n4. Λ⁰ → K⁺ + K⁻\n\n• Baryon number: Λ⁰ is a baryon (B = 1) while both K⁺ and K⁻ are mesons (B = 0); baryon number would not be conserved.  \n• Thus this decay is forbidden by baryon number conservation.\n\n5. Ξ⁰ → p + π⁻\n\n• Baryon number: Ξ⁰ (1) decays into proton (1) and pion (0) – that’s fine.  \n• Strangeness: Ξ⁰ has S = –2 whereas the proton and pion have S = 0. So the decay would involve ΔS = +2.  \n• In the standard weak interaction the dominant nonleptonic decays change strangeness by ±1. A ΔS = 2 decay is (aside from being “second order” in the weak interaction) extremely suppressed and effectively never observed.\n \n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Summary  \n─────────────────────────────\n\n(a) Among the “proton–proton” and “proton–neutron” reactions, the first reaction violates baryon‐number conservation, and the others would require the creation of two net units of strangeness (i.e. ΔS = –2) in a strong interaction, which is not allowed. (Even if enough kinetic energy were supplied, these conservation laws (or extreme suppression of ΔS = 2 processes) prevent these reactions from occurring.)\n\n(b) In the decays:\n  – Ξ⁰ → Σ⁰ + Λ⁰ and Σ⁺ → Λ⁰ + K⁺ are kinematically forbidden (the final state masses add up to more than the available mass) and/or would wrongly change the net strangeness.\n  – Ξ⁻ → n + π⁻, while kinematically allowed, would require a ΔS = 2 weak transition which is highly suppressed by the structure of the weak interaction.\n  – Λ⁰ → K⁺ + K⁻ violates baryon-number conservation (going from one baryon to two mesons).\n\nThus none of these processes is observed.\n\nFinal Answer in boxed LaTeX:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) The reaction }p+p\\to K^++\\Sigma^+\\text{ is forbidden because it does not conserve baryon number,}\\\\[1mm]\n\\quad\\;

{"id": "atomic/3-28", "solution": "We begin by examining the reactions and decays provided.\n\nStep 1. (a) Strangeness of Σ*\n\nConsider the reaction K⁻p → π⁻Σ*⁺. The K⁻ meson has a quark content of (s, ū); thus, by the definition of strangeness S = –(nₛ – n_anti-s), the K⁻ has S = –1. The proton (uud) has S = 0. Therefore, the total initial strangeness is –1. Since strong interactions conserve strangeness, the final state must also have a total strangeness of –1. The pion (π⁻) has no strangeness (S = 0), meaning that the Σ* must carry S = –1. This is further supported by the fact that the alternative reaction, K⁺p → π⁺Σ*⁺, does not occur because K⁺ (with quark content uŝ) carries S = +1. In that case, the initial state strangeness would be +1, and it would not be possible to produce a state (with π⁺ having S = 0) that includes a hyperon with S = –1.\n\nThus, the Σ* has strangeness S = –1.\n\nStep 2. (b) Nature of the decay\n\nThe Σ* decays via Σ* → π⁺Λ. The Λ hyperon has a mass of about 1116 MeV, and the π⁺ has about 140 MeV, so the total mass of the decay products is around 1256 MeV, which is significantly less than the mass of the Σ* (1385 MeV). Also, its decay width is Γ = 35 MeV, which corresponds to a very short lifetime ~10⁻²³ s, typical for a strong decay. Most importantly, the decay conserves strangeness (Σ* with S = –1 decays to Λ with S = –1 and π with S = 0) and involves no change of flavor that would require the weak interaction.\n\nThus, the decay is a strong decay.\n\nStep 3. (c) Isospin of Σ*\n\nThe Σ baryons (and their excited states such as Σ*) are known to belong to an isospin multiplet. For the ground-state Σ baryons, we have Σ⁺, Σ⁰, and Σ⁻ forming an isotriplet (I = 1). The same pattern holds for the excited states such as the Σ* mentioned here. Furthermore, note that the decay Σ*⁺ → π⁺Λ involves the Λ, which is an isospin singlet (I = 0), and the pion, which has I = 1. Since the final state has the isospin of the pion (I = 1), the parent Σ* must have I = 1 to allow for proper coupling in the strong decay.\n\nThus, the Σ* has isospin I = 1.\n\nFinal Answer in Latex:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a) } &\\text{The } \\Sigma^* \\text{ has strangeness } S=-1. \\\\\n\\text{(b) } &\\text{The decay is strong, as indicated by the short lifetime (large width) and the conservation of strangeness.} \\\\\n\\text{(c) } &\\text{The } \\Sigma^* \\text{ belongs to an isospin triplet and therefore has isospin } I=1.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a) } &\\text{The } \\Sigma^* \\text{ has strangeness } S=-1. \\\\\n\\text{(b) } &\\text{The decay is strong, as indicated by the short lifetime (large width) and the conservation of strangeness.} \\\\\n\\text{(c) } &\\text{The } \\Sigma^* \\text{ belongs to an isospin triplet and therefore has isospin } I=1.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a) } &\\text{The } \\Sigma^* \\text{ has strangeness } S=-1. \\\\\n\\text{(b) } &\\text{The decay is strong, as indicated by the short lifetime (large width) and the conservation of strangeness.} \\\\\n\\text{(c) } &\\text{The } \\Sigma^* \\text{ belongs to an isospin triplet and therefore has isospin } I=1.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "-1"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a) } &\\text{The } \\Sigma^* \\text{ has strangeness } S=-1. \\\\\n\\text{(b) } &\\text{The decay is strong, as indicated by the short lifetime (large width) and the conservation of strangeness.} \\\\\n\\text{(c) } &\\text{The } \\Sigma^* \\text{ belongs to an isospin triplet and therefore has isospin } I=1.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{strong decay}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a) } &\\text{The } \\Sigma^* \\text{ has strangeness } S=-1. \\\\\n\\text{(b) } &\\text{The decay is strong, as indicated by the short lifetime (large width) and the conservation of strangeness.} \\\\\n\\text{(c) } &\\text{The } \\Sigma^* \\text{ belongs to an isospin triplet and therefore has isospin } I=1.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "1"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/3-43", "solution": "We will address each part step‐by‐step.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n(a) Experimental evidences\n\n(1) Two kinds of neutrino  \nOne of the most famous experiments was carried out at Brookhaven in the early 1960s (the Lederman–Schwartz–Steinberger experiment). A beam of neutrinos was produced via pion decay (π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν₍μ₎), so that only muon‐flavored neutrinos were present. When this beam struck a target producing charged‐current reactions, only muons (and not electrons) were observed in the final state. If the neutrinos were “universal” (i.e. only one type), one would expect both electrons and muons to be produced. This demonstrated that the neutrino involved in pion decay (the muon neutrino, ν₍μ₎) is different from the one associated with beta decay (the electron neutrino, ν₍e₎).\n\n(2) Small interaction cross section  \nNeutrino detection in experiments (whether with reactor neutrinos or accelerator beams) relies on extremely rare interactions. Despite intense neutrino fluxes and massive detectors, the rate of neutrino events is extremely low. For example, in neutrino scattering experiments one finds that neutrinos typically traverse many kilometers of material before interacting. This very small interaction cross section (of the order of 10⁻³⁸ cm² at GeV energies) is deduced from the measured event rates and the known neutrino flux and target mass.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n(b) Single-pion production by an energetic neutrino\n\nIn charged-current interactions an energetic neutrino can excite a nucleon into a Δ-resonance which then decays into a nucleon and a pion. Two representative reactions are:\n\n(1) For a proton target:  \n  ν₍μ₎ + p → μ⁻ + Δ⁺⁺, followed by Δ⁺⁺ → p + π⁺.  \nIn one-step notation,  \n  ν₍μ₎ + p → μ⁻ + p + π⁺.\n\n(2) For a neutron target:  \n  ν₍μ₎ + n → μ⁻ + Δ⁺, followed by one typical decay mode Δ⁺ → p + π⁰,  \nso that  \n  ν₍μ₎ + n → μ⁻ + p + π⁰.  \n\n(Alternatively, one may also have the channel:  \n  ν₍μ₎ + n → μ⁻ + n + π⁺,  \nwhich also conserves charge; both channels occur depending on the dynamics.)\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n(c) Definition of helicity\n\nHelicity is defined as the projection of a particle’s spin along its momentum direction. For a (massless or ultrarelativistic) fermion the helicity takes on the values ±1/2 (often expressed simply by “left‐handed” or “right‐handed”). In the Standard Model  \n  • Neutrinos are produced only in the left-handed helicity state (helicity = –1/2);  \n  • Antineutrinos are produced in the right-handed helicity state (helicity = +1/2).  \n(In many contexts the overall factor of 1/2 is omitted and one simply refers to “negative helicity” for neutrinos and “positive helicity” for antineutrinos.)\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n(d) Possibility of certain μ⁺ decay modes\n\nStandard μ⁺ decay is through μ⁺ → e⁺ + ν₍e₎ + ν̄₍μ₎. Let us discuss the two proposed modes:\n\n(1) μ⁺ → e⁺ + γ  \nThis decay would involve a coupling of a muon to an electron and a photon at tree level. However, in the Standard Model there is no allowed tree‐level vertex for a direct μ–e–γ coupling and the loop contributions (which require lepton–flavor violation) are extremely suppressed (by GIM cancellations). In effect, lepton flavor conservation forbids such a process at an observable rate. Therefore, μ⁺ → e⁺ + γ does not proceed naturally.\n\n(2) μ⁺ → e⁺ + e⁻ + e⁺  \nIn this decay mode one must check the separate conservation of lepton flavors. The initial μ⁺ is the antiparticle of a muon and carries muon lepton number (say L₍μ₎ = –1) while carrying no electron lepton number (L₍e₎ = 0). In the final state, each e⁺ carries L₍e₎ = –1 and the e⁻ carries L₍e₎ = +1; thus the total electron lepton number becomes –1 +1 –1 = –1, while no muon lepton number is present. Since the Standard Model conserves electron number and muon number separately (or, equivalently, conserves the total lepton number for each family), this decay violates lepton family number conservation. Hence, μ⁺ → e⁺ + e⁻ + e⁺ does not occur naturally either.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\textbf{(a)} \\\\\n\\quad (1)\\ \\text{The Brookhaven

(This is the same reason that a free charged particle cannot radiate a real photon without interaction with external fields.) \n\nThus, Reaction 1 violates energy–momentum (four–momentum) conservation.\n \n────────────────────────\n2. e⁻ → νₑ + γ\n\nA very similar argument applies here. In the rest frame of an electron, one would not be able to satisfy simultaneously energy and momentum conservation with a massless photon and a nearly massless neutrino. (In fact, a free electron cannot spontaneously emit a photon – a well–known result that underlies why “bremsstrahlung” requires an external field.) \n\nThus, Reaction 2 violates energy–momentum conservation.\n\n────────────────────────\n3. p + p → p + Σ⁺ + K⁻\n\nWe now check several quantum numbers.\n\n• Charge: A proton has charge +1. The two‐proton initial state has total charge +2. In the final state, the proton (charge +1) plus the Σ⁺ (charge +1) plus the K⁻ (charge −1) add up to +1. Hence, the electric charge is not conserved.\n\n• Strangeness: In strong interactions, strangeness is conserved. The initial state has strangeness 0, but note that the Σ⁺ has strangeness –1 and the K⁻ (which is an anti–strange meson) also has strangeness –1. This gives a total final strangeness of –2.\n\nThus, Reaction 3 violates electric charge conservation (and also, if this were supposed to occur via the strong interaction, strangeness conservation).\n\n────────────────────────\n4. p → e⁺ + νₑ\n\nA proton has baryon number +1. Neither a positron nor a neutrino carries baryon number (both have baryon number 0). Although the charge is conserved (proton +1 → e⁺ + neutrino gives +1 + 0 = +1) and one might balance lepton number (by assigning the positron a lepton number –1 and the neutrino a lepton number +1), the crucial violation is that the baryon number is not conserved.\n\nThus, Reaction 4 violates baryon–number conservation.\n\n────────────────────────\n5. p → e⁺ + n + νₑ\n\nLet’s check the numbers:\n• Baryon number: The proton (B = +1) goes to a neutron (B = +1) plus e⁺ and νₑ (B = 0 each). So baryon number is conserved.\n• Charge: Proton has +1; the neutron 0, e⁺ +1, and neutrino 0, so charge sums to +1.\n• Lepton number: The initial proton has 0. In the final state, one can assign the positron (being the antiparticle of the electron) a lepton number –1 and the neutrino +1, so the net lepton number is 0.\nHowever, even though all (quantum) numbers balance in principle, the proton’s mass is 938.272 MeV whereas the neutron’s is 939.565 MeV and the positron (and neutrino) require additional energy. In free space there is insufficient mass–energy in the proton to produce a heavier neutron plus additional products.\n\nThus, Reaction 5 is kinematically forbidden – it violates energy–momentum (mass–energy) conservation.\n\n────────────────────────\n6. n → p + e⁻ + ν̄ₑ\n\nThis is the classic beta decay of the free neutron. All conservation laws are satisfied:\n• Charge: 0 → (+1) + (–1) + 0.\n• Baryon number: +1 → +1 + 0 + 0.\n• Lepton number: 0 → 0 (with the electron [+1] and the antineutrino [–1]).\n• Energy–momentum: The neutron mass (≈939.565 MeV) exceeds the sum of the proton mass (≈938.272 MeV) and the electron mass (≈0.511 MeV); the neutrino’s energy is also accommodated.\n\nThus, Reaction 6 obeys all conservation laws.\n\n────────────────────────\n7. π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ\n\nThis is the well–known decay of the charged pion:\n• Charge: π⁺ has +1; μ⁺ + neutrino gives +1 + 0.\n• Lepton number: The pion is a meson (lepton number 0), while the muon is the “wrong” sign (μ⁺ is the antiparticle of the μ⁻, so it carries lepton number –1) and the muon neutrino carries lepton number +1. The net lepton number is 0.\n• Energy–momentum is satisfied since m(π⁺) ≈ 139.57 MeV is larger than m(μ⁺) ≈ 105.66 MeV.\n\nThus, Reaction 7 obeys all the relevant conservation laws.\n\n────────────────────────\nTo Summarize:\n\n1. μ⁺ → e⁺ + γ \n  Violates energy–momentum conservation.\n\n2. e⁻ → νₑ + γ \n  Violates energy–momentum conservation.\n\n3. p + p → p + Σ⁺ + K⁻ \n  Violates electric charge conservation (and also strangeness conservation in a strong–interaction context).\n\n4. p → e⁺ + νₑ \n  Violates baryon–number conservation.\n\n5. p → e⁺ + n + νₑ \n  Violates energy–momentum conservation (mass–energy is insufficient).\n\n6. n → p + e⁻ + ν̄ₑ \n  Allowed (all conservation laws are satisfied).\n\n7. π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ \n  Allowed (all conservation laws are satisfied).\n\n────────────────────────\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n\\mu^+ \\rightarrow e^+ + \\gamma & \\text{violates energy--momentum conservation,} \\\\\ne^- \\rightarrow \\nu_e + \\gamma & \\text{violates energy--momentum conservation,} \\\\\np + p \\rightarrow p + \\Sigma^+ + K^- & \\text{violates electric charge (and strangeness) conservation,} \\\\\np \\rightarrow e^+ + \\nu_e & \\text{violates baryon--number conservation,} \\\\\np \\rightarrow e^+ + n + \\nu_e & \\text{violates energy--momentum (mass--energy) conservation,} \\\\\nn \\rightarrow p + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e & \\text{allowed,} \\\\\n\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu_\\mu & \\text{allowed.}\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{array}{rl}\n\\mu^+ \\rightarrow e^+ + \\gamma & \\text{violates energy--momentum conservation,} \\\\\ne^- \\rightarrow \\nu_e + \\gamma & \\text{violates energy--momentum conservation,} \\\\\np + p \\rightarrow p + \\Sigma^+ + K^- & \\text{violates electric charge (and strangeness) conservation,} \\\\\np \\rightarrow e^+ + \\nu_e & \\text{violates baryon--number conservation,} \\\\\np \\rightarrow e^+ + n + \\nu_e & \\text{violates energy--momentum (mass--energy) conservation,} \\\\\nn \\rightarrow p + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e & \\text{allowed,} \\\\\n\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu_\\mu & \\text{allowed.}\n\\end{array}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{rl}\n\\mu^+ \\rightarrow e^+ + \\gamma & \\text{violates energy--momentum conservation,} \\\\\ne^- \\rightarrow \\nu_e + \\gamma & \\text{violates energy--momentum conservation,} \\\\\np + p \\rightarrow p + \\Sigma^+ + K^- & \\text{violates electric charge (and strangeness) conservation,} \\\\\np \\rightarrow e^+ + \\nu_e & \\text{violates baryon--number conservation,} \\\\\np \\rightarrow e^+ + n + \\nu_e & \\text{violates energy--momentum (mass--energy) conservation,} \\\\\nn \\rightarrow p + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e & \\text{allowed,} \\\\\n\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu_\\mu & \\text{allowed.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "\\mu^+ \\rightarrow e^+ + \\gamma \\text{ violates lepton number conservation}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{rl}\n\\mu^+ \\rightarrow e^+ + \\gamma & \\text{violates energy--momentum conservation,} \\\\\ne^- \\rightarrow \\nu_e + \\gamma & \\text{violates energy--momentum conservation,} \\\\\np + p \\rightarrow p + \\Sigma^+ + K^- & \\text{violates electric charge (and strangeness) conservation,} \\\\\np \\rightarrow e^+ + \\nu_e & \\text{violates baryon--number conservation,} \\\\\np \\rightarrow e^+ + n + \\nu_e & \\text{violates energy--momentum (mass--energy) conservation,} \\\\\nn \\rightarrow p + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e & \\text{allowed,} \\\\\n\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu_\\mu & \\text{allowed.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "e^- \\rightarrow \\nu_e + \\gamma \\text{ violates charge conservation}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{rl}\n\\mu^+ \\rightarrow e^+ + \\gamma & \\text{violates energy--momentum conservation,} \\\\\ne^- \\rightarrow \\nu_e + \\gamma & \\text{violates energy--momentum conservation,} \\\\\np + p \\rightarrow p + \\Sigma^+ + K^- & \\text{violates electric charge (and strangeness) conservation,} \\\\\np \\rightarrow e^+ + \\nu_e & \\text{violates baryon--number conservation,} \\\\\np \\rightarrow e^+ + n + \\nu_e & \\text{violates energy--momentum (mass--energy) conservation,} \\\\\nn \\rightarrow p + e^- + \\bar{\\nu}_e & \\text{allowed,} \\\\\n\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu_\\mu & \\text{allowed.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "p + p \\rightarrow p + \\Sigma^+ + K^- \\text{ violates charge conservation}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "atomic/3-11", "solution": "We begin by recalling that in the Standard Model there are six leptons. Their “flavors” are:\n\n • The charged leptons: the electron (e⁻), the muon (μ⁻), and the tau (τ⁻).\n\n • The corresponding neutrinos: the electron neutrino (νₑ), the muon neutrino (ν_μ), and the tau neutrino (ν_τ).\n\n(Each of these has the appropriate antiparticle with opposite additive quantum numbers.)\n\nStep 1. Listing the Known Leptons\n\nThus, the known leptons (and their antiparticles) are:\n  e⁻, μ⁻, τ⁻ and νₑ, ν_μ, ν_τ,\nwith the antiparticles\n  e⁺, μ⁺, τ⁺ and anti-νₑ, anti-ν_μ, anti-ν_τ.\n\nStep 2. How Does μ⁺ Decay?\n\nThe positive muon (μ⁺) is the antimatter partner of the μ⁻. Its decay occurs via the weak interaction according to\n  μ⁺ → e⁺ + νₑ + anti-ν_μ.\nThis decay is mediated by a virtual W⁺ boson:\n 1. The μ⁺ first emits a W⁺ (or equivalently, “absorbs” a virtual W⁻), thereby “converting” to an anti-ν_μ.\n 2. The W⁺ then decays into an e⁺ and a νₑ.\nThus, the complete decay is as written above.\n\nStep 3. Lepton Quantum Number Assignments\n\nIn order to account for the observed decays and forbidden reactions, it is conventional to assign each lepton its own additive “flavor quantum number” which is separately conserved in all (at least the low‐energy) interactions. For example, define:\n\n • Lₑ (electron number): +1 for e⁻ and νₑ, –1 for e⁺ and anti-νₑ.\n • L_μ (muon number): +1 for μ⁻ and ν_μ, –1 for μ⁺ and anti-ν_μ.\n • L_τ (tau number): +1 for τ⁻ and ν_τ, –1 for τ⁺ and anti-ν_τ.\n\nNow look at the μ⁺ decay. The initial state is μ⁺ which has L_μ = –1 (and Lₑ = 0). In the final state:\n • The positron e⁺ carries Lₑ = –1.\n • The electron neutrino νₑ carries Lₑ = +1.\n • The muon antineutrino anti-ν_μ carries L_μ = –1.\nThus the net electron number is (–1 + 1) = 0 and the net muon number remains –1. In other words, each individual flavor lepton number is conserved in the decay.\n\nNow consider the forbidden reaction:\n  ν_μ + n → e⁻ + p.\nHere, the initial muon neutrino ν_μ has L_μ = +1 (with Lₑ = 0). The final state electron e⁻ carries Lₑ = +1. The nucleons (neutron n and proton p) have no lepton number. Thus the overall lepton numbers would change from L_μ = +1 to Lₑ = +1, thereby violating the separate conservation of muon and electron numbers. (Though the total lepton number might still be conserved, the lack of “mixing” between flavors in low‐energy charged current weak interactions makes this process forbidden.)\n\nThe lesson is that the individual (or “family”) lepton numbers (Lₑ, L_μ, L_τ) must be treated as separately conserved quantities in these interactions.\n\nStep 4. How Could ν_μ Produce a New Charged “Heavy Lepton”?\n\nBecause of these separate lepton flavor numbers, a neutrino always “chooses” to interact via the charged current with its corresponding charged partner. That is, in a charged current weak interaction, the vertex always connects νₑ with e⁻ (or e⁺ with anti-νₑ), ν_μ with μ⁻ (or μ⁺ with anti-ν_μ), and ν_τ with τ⁻ (or τ⁺ with anti-ν_τ). \n\nThus, if one were to observe that a ν_μ initiates a charged-current reaction in which a new, heavy charged lepton is produced, then one could infer that this new charged lepton must be the “muon partner” of ν_μ in a new generation. In other words, if we hypothesized an additional heavy charged lepton (call it, say, L⁻) which carried muon-type quantum number (L_μ), its production in a reaction like\n  ν_μ + X → L⁻ + Y\nwould be perfectly allowed provided that:\n 1. L_μ is conserved (with the ν_μ having L_μ = +1 and L⁻ having L_μ = +1),\n 2. Kinematics permits its production (i.e. the energy is sufficient for the heavier mass),\n and\n 3. Its coupling is via the usual charged weak current.\nOne would then have a situation analogous to the electron case – where νₑ produces an e⁻ – but with the muon neutrino producing a heavy charged lepton that is its “partner” in the muon family. This is why, in charged current interactions, the neutrino “selects” the corresponding charged lepton: the flavor quantum numbers enforce that a ν_μ can only produce a lepton with muon quantum number, and not an electron.\n\nFinal Summary:\n1. The six known leptons are: e⁻, μ⁻, τ⁻, νₑ, ν_μ, and ν_τ (plus the respective antiparticles).\n2. The μ⁺ decays as μ⁺ → e⁺ + νₑ + anti-ν_μ.\n3. Assigning separate additive quantum numbers (Lₑ, L_μ, L_τ) to the leptons allows one to understand both the allowed decay of μ⁺ and why processes like ν_μ + n → e⁻ + p are forbidden.\n4. In charged current interactions, the ν_μ can only produce charged leptons that carry muon number. Thus, if a ν_μ were to produce a new charged “heavy lepton,” that lepton must be the muon partner (i.e. carry L_μ) – analogous to the way νₑ produces an electron.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(1) The known leptons are } e^-,\\,\\mu^-,\\,\\tau^-,\\,\\nu_e,\\,\\nu_\\mu,\\,\\nu_\\tau\\text{ (plus their antiparticles).}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(2) The } \\mu^+ \\text{ decays via } \\mu^+ \\to e^+ + \\nu_e + \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(3) If we assign separate lepton numbers } L_e,\\; L_\\mu,\\; L_\\tau \\text{ (with, e.g., } L_e(e^-)=+1,\\; L_e(e^+)=-1, \\text{ etc.),}\\\\\n\\quad\\quad \\text{then in } \\mu^+ \\to e^+ + \\nu_e + \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu \\text{ we have conservation } (L_\\mu: -1 \\to -1,\\; L_e: 0 \\to +1-1=0).\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{This same conservation forbids } \\nu_\\mu + n\\to e^- + p \\text{, since it would not conserve the individual flavor numbers.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(4) In charged-current weak interactions the neutrino of a given flavor always produces a charged partner}\\\\\n\\quad\\quad \\text{with the same lepton number.

(Note that for an isotropic background there is some smearing of the threshold, but this estimate is representative.)\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 2. (Mean Free Path for Pair Production)\n\nThe pair–production reaction occurs with a cross section on the order of\n\n  σ_pp ≈ σ_T/3,\n \nwhere the Thomson cross section is given by\n\n  σ_T = (8π/3) rₑ²       with  rₑ = e²/(mₑc²) ≈ 2.82×10⁻¹³ cm.\n\nLet us estimate σ_T:\n\n  rₑ² ≈ (2.82×10⁻¹³ cm)² ≈ 7.95×10⁻²⁶ cm².\n  σ_T ≈ (8π/3)(7.95×10⁻²⁶ cm²) ≈ 6.67×10⁻²⁵ cm².\n\nThus, \n  σ_pp ≈ (1/3)×6.67×10⁻²⁵ cm² ≈ 2.22×10⁻²⁵ cm².\n\nThe number density of microwave photons is approximately\n\n  n ≈ 300 cm⁻³.\n\nThe mean free path is given by\n\n  λ = 1/(n σ_pp) ≈ 1/(300 cm⁻³ × 2.22×10⁻²⁵ cm²).\n\nCalculate the product:\n  300 × 2.22×10⁻²⁵ = 6.66×10⁻²³ cm⁻¹,\n\nso\n\n  λ ≈ 1.5×10²² cm.\n\nIt is often useful to express distances in kiloparsecs.

(Comparison with the Size of the Universe)\n\nThe “size” (radius) of the observable Universe is on the order of 10²⁸ cm, or roughly 3×10⁹ pc (a few Gigaparsecs). Therefore the mean free path λ ~ 5 kpc is very short compared with the size of the universe. In fact,\n\n  λ / (size of Universe) ≈ (5×10³ pc)/(3×10⁹ pc) ≈ 1.7×10⁻⁶.\n\nThus, high-energy γ–rays above threshold will only travel a tiny fraction of the universe’s size before converting into e⁺e⁻ pairs.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 4. (Lifetime-Limiting Process for Ultra–High–Energy Protons)\n\nWhen one considers protons of energies ≥ 10²⁰ eV moving in the same microwave background it turns out that the ordinary Compton (or γp) scattering cross section is negligible. However, protons can interact with the microwave photons via\n\n  p + γ → Δ⁺ → { p + π⁰  or  n + π⁺ }.\n\nThis process, known as photopion production, is responsible for what is called the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff. It effectively limits the mean free path and lifetime of ultra–high–energy protons, because they lose energy by the production of (mostly) pions in collisions with the CMB photons.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) γ–rays with energies of order\n  E₍γ₎ ~ mₑ²c⁴/ϵ ~ 2.6×10¹⁴ eV (a few hundred TeV) \nwill have their lifetimes limited by pair production.\n\n(b) Their mean free path is \n  λ ~ 1/(nσ) ~ 1.5×10²² cm ~ 5 kiloparsecs.\n\n(c) This mean free path is extremely short compared with the size of the Universe (∼10²⁸ cm or billions of parsecs); in fact it is roughly 10⁻⁶ times the size of the observable universe.\n\n(d) Ultra–high–energy protons (E ≥ 10²⁰ eV) are attenuated mainly by photopion production (the GZK process), i.e. p + γ → Δ⁺ → p + π⁰ (or n + π⁺), which limits their lifetime.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer in Latex Boxed Format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) } E_\\gamma \\sim \\frac{m_e^2 c^4}{\\epsilon} \\sim 2.6\\times10^{14}\\,\\text{eV}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b) } \\lambda \\sim \\frac{1}{n\\,\\sigma} \\sim 1.5\\times10^{22}\\,\\text{cm} \\sim 5\\,\\text{kpc}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(c) } \\lambda \\ll \\text{size of Universe (}\\sim10^{28}\\,\\text{cm, i.e. billions of parsecs)}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(d) } \\text{Photopion production (the GZK process) limits ultra–high–energy protons.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) } E_\\gamma \\sim \\frac{m_e^2 c^4}{\\epsilon} \\sim 2.6\\times10^{14}\\,\\text{eV}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b) } \\lambda \\sim \\frac{1}{n\\,\\sigma} \\sim 1.5\\times10^{22}\\,\\text{cm} \\sim 5\\,\\text{kpc}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(c) } \\lambda \\ll \\text{size of Universe (}\\sim10^{28}\\,\\text{cm, i.e. billions of parsecs)}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(d) } \\text{Photopion production (the GZK process) limits ultra–high–energy protons.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) } E_\\gamma \\sim \\frac{m_e^2 c^4}{\\epsilon} \\sim 2.6\\times10^{14}\\,\\text{eV}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b) } \\lambda \\sim \\frac{1}{n\\,\\sigma} \\sim 1.5\\times10^{22}\\,\\text{cm} \\sim 5\\,\\text{kpc}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(c) } \\lambda \\ll \\text{size of Universe (}\\sim10^{28}\\,\\text{cm, i.e. billions of parsecs)}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(d) } \\text{Photopion production (the GZK process) limits ultra–high–energy protons.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "E_{\\min} = 2.6 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/3-27", "solution": "Below is one acceptable answer. (Any answer which obtains the proper orders‐of–magnitude and identifies the “selection rules” – some of which are “fundamental” (exact, like Bose symmetry, angular–momentum, baryon–number, etc.) and some “phenomenological” (like the ΔI = 1/2 rule or the OZI rule) – is acceptable.) In what follows we outline one way of “estimating” each ratio and state whether the decay proceeds by the strong, electromagnetic or weak interaction. (In many cases one may “express” the answer in terms of such constants as the Cabibbo angle θc, the electromagnetic fine–structure constant α, a typical hadronic scale such as mK, and the weak–interaction constant GF; we also assume that the “strong coupling” is unity.) \n\n────────────────────────────\n(a) K⁺ → π⁺π⁰ versus K⁰_S → π⁺π⁻\n\nBoth decays are weak (ΔS = 1) but they proceed via different isospin channels. In the usual “ΔI = 1/2‐rule” the dominant weak nonleptonic amplitude is “enhanced” whereas the ΔI = 3/2 amplitude is small. In fact, K⁰_S → π⁺π⁻ is dominated by the ΔI = 1/2 amplitude, while K⁺ → π⁺π⁰ receives only a ΔI = 3/2 contribution. (This is a phenomenological rule.) One may then write\n  A(K⁺ → π⁺π⁰) ∼ GF sin θc cos θc × (small “ΔI = 3/2 factor”)\n  A(K⁰_S → π⁺π⁻) ∼ GF sin θc cos θc × (ΔI = 1/2 term that is “enhanced”)\nso that\n  (rate ratio) ∼ (A₍₃⁄₂₎/A₍₁⁄₂₎)² ∼ tan²θc     (since tan θc ≈ 0.22)\nNumerically, this gives a ratio ≈ 0.05.\n\n────────────────────────────\n(b) ρ⁰ → π⁰π⁰ versus ρ⁰ → π⁺π⁻\n\nBoth decays are strong. (A ρ⁰ decays hadronically.) However, Bose statistics and isospin conservation forbid ρ⁰ → π⁰π⁰. (The ρ⁰ has isospin I = 1 and the two–pion state in an s–wave must be symmetric; one may show that the π⁰π⁰ state cannot have I = 1.) Hence, \n  (π⁰π⁰)/(π⁺π⁻) ≡ 0.\n\n────────────────────────────\n(c) K⁰_L → μ⁺μ⁻ versus K⁰_L → π⁰π⁰\n\nBoth are weak decays. The K⁰_L decay into μ⁺μ⁻ is “second–order” (it proceeds by a two–photon intermediate state or by penguin diagrams; it is also subject to helicity suppression) so that its amplitude is of order ~GF² and comes with a further factor of ~α. In contrast K⁰_L → π⁰π⁰ is “CP–violating” since K⁰_L is mostly CP–odd while the two–pion final state has positive CP; its amplitude is suppressed by the small CP–violating parameter ε (of order 10⁻³). One acceptable answer is to write\n  A(K⁰_L → μ⁺μ⁻) ∼ (GF² mK²)/(16π²)        [loop & helicity suppression]\n  A(K⁰_L → π⁰π⁰) ∼ ε GF fπ mK\nso that\n  (rate ratio) ∼ [(GF mK²/(16π²))/(ε GF fπ mK)]² ∼ (GF mK/(16π² ε fπ))².\nThus the ratio is very small. (A “ball–park” number depends on details; one may say that the ratio is of order a few percent – though much smaller values occur in nature, reflecting the extra GIM– and helicity–suppression factors.) \n  (Selection rules: CP–invariance [fundamental] and GIM plus helicity suppression in the μ⁺μ⁻ channel.)\n\n────────────────────────────\n(d) K⁺ → π⁺ π⁺ e⁻ ν versus K⁻ → π⁺ π⁻ e⁻ ν\n\nThese are weak semileptonic (“Kₑ₄”) decays. Again the ΔI = 1/2 rule is operative. In K⁻ → π⁺π⁻e⁻ν one may have the dominant ΔI = 1/2 amplitude, while in K⁺ → π⁺π⁺e⁻ν the isospin of the two pions is forced to be I = 2 (i.e. ΔI = 3/2) and is therefore suppressed. Hence, one expects \n  (rate ratio) ∼ tan²θc    (with tan²θc ≈ 0.05).\n\n────────────────────────────\n(e) Ω⁻ → Σ⁻ π⁰ versus Ω⁻ → Ξ⁰ π⁻\n\nBoth decays are weak nonleptonic decays. Detailed quark–counting shows that Ω⁻ → Ξ⁰ π⁻ proceeds via a ΔI = 1/2 amplitude while Ω⁻ → Σ⁻ π⁰ has (or is dominated by) a ΔI = 3/2 amplitude. (This is analogous to the case in (a) and (d).) Thus one expects \n  (rate ratio) ∼ tan²θc    ≈ 0.05.\n  (Selection rule: the phenomenological ΔI = 1/2 rule.)\n\n────────────────────────────\n(f) η⁰ → π⁺π⁻ versus η⁰ → π⁺π⁻π⁰\n\nThe decay η → ππ is highly suppressed. (In fact, η has JPC = 0⁻⁺ while a two–pion s–wave state has 0⁺⁺; the decay would violate CP or, equivalently, G–parity, which is an (approximate) symmetry of the strong interactions.) In contrast η → 3π is allowed (although it is itself “small” because it can occur only because of isospin–breaking effects such as m₍u₎ ≠ m₍d₎). Thus\n  (rate ratio) ≈ 0.\n\n────────────────────────────\n(g) Λ⁰ → K⁻ π⁺ versus Λ⁰ → p π⁻\n\nThe Λ⁰ (which has baryon number 1) decays weakly via ΔS = 1 into p π⁻. In contrast Λ⁰ → K⁻ π⁺ (which would have all–meson final states) violates baryon–number conservation (and/or is grossly kinematically forbidden) and is therefore forbidden.\n  (rate ratio) ≡ 0.\n\n────────────────────────────\n(h) θ⁰ → π⁺π⁻π⁰ versus ω⁰ → π⁺π⁻π⁰\n\nBoth decays are strong. (In the famous “θ–ω puzzle” the two particles have nearly the same mass and quantum numbers except that one is unusually narrow.) In many models one finds that the decay θ⁰ is “OZI suppressed” (that is, it can occur only via diagrams in which one has disconnected quark–graphs) while ω⁰ → 3π takes place via the “normal” strong amplitude. Thus one may estimate\n  (rate ratio) ∼ (OZI suppression factor) ≪ 1.\n(Here the “small number” is determined empirically; the crucial point is that the suppression is not due to any fundamental symmetry but is “phenomenological”.)\n\n────────────────────────────\n(i) Σ⁻ → Λ⁰ π⁻ versus Σ⁻ → n π⁻\n\nAgain these are weak nonleptonic decays. However, by checking masses one finds that\n  m(Σ⁻) ≈ 1197 MeV   m(Λ⁰) + m(π⁻) ≈ 1116 + 140 ≈ 1256 MeV,\nso that Σ⁻ → Λ⁰ π⁻ is kinematically forbidden.\n  (rate ratio) ≡ 0.\n  (Selection rule: exact kinematics – a “fundamental” (energy–conservation) rule.)\n\n────────────────────────────\n(j) π⁻ → e⁻ ν versus K⁺ → μ⁺ ν\n\nBoth leptonic decays are induced by the weak charged current (W–exchange). The rate is (apart from phase–space)\nproportional to G_F² f_P² m_P m_ℓ² (1 – m_ℓ²/m_P²)² (this “helicity–suppression” factor m_ℓ² is due to the V–A structure). Consequently, one may write\n  Γ(P → ℓν) ∝ G_F² f_P² m_P m_ℓ²     (neglecting (1 – m_ℓ²/m_P²)² when m_ℓ ≪ m_P).\nThus the ratio is\n  (π⁻ → e⁻ ν)/(K⁺ → μ⁺ ν) ∼ [f_π² m_π m_e²]/[f_K² m_K m_μ²].\nOne may leave the answer in this form (or “express” it in words as “proportional to (m_e²/m_μ²)(m_π/m_K), etc.”).\n  (Selection rule: the helicity suppression of the π decay; both decays are “pure” weak processes.)\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Brief\n\n(a) K⁺ → π⁺π⁰ versus K⁰_S → π⁺π⁻  \n  → Both are weak. Only ΔI = 3/2 contributes to K⁺ decay while K_S decays via ΔI = 1/2; hence  \n    (Γ(K⁺ → π⁺π⁰))/(Γ(K⁰_S → π⁺π⁻)) ∼ tan²θ_c ≈ 0.05.\n\n(b) ρ⁰ → π⁰π⁰ versus ρ⁰ → π⁺π⁻  \n  → Both are strong, but ρ⁰ → π⁰π⁰ is forbidden by Bose symmetry and isospin; the ratio is 0.\n\n(c) K⁰_L → μ⁺μ⁻ versus K⁰_L → π⁰π⁰  \n  → Both are weak. The μ⁺μ⁻ mode is second–order (GIM+helicity–suppressed, ∼α) while π⁰π⁰ is only allowed via CP–violation (∼ε); hence,  \n    (Γ(K⁰_L → μ⁺μ⁻))/(Γ(K⁰_L → π⁰π⁰)) ∼ [GF² m_K⁴/(256 π⁴ ε²)] (a very small number).\n\n(d) K⁺ → π⁺π⁺e⁻ν versus K⁻ → π⁺π⁻e⁻ν  \n  → Both are semileptonic weak decays; the former is forced to be ΔI = 3/2 while the latter has the dominant ΔI = 1/2 contribution, so  \n    (rate ratio) ∼ tan²θ_c ≈ 0.05.\n\n(e) Ω⁻ → Σ⁻π⁰ versus Ω⁻ → Ξ⁰π⁻  \n  → Both are weak nonleptonic decays. The Σ⁻π⁰ mode is ΔI = 3/2 (suppressed) whereas Ξ⁰π⁻ is ΔI = 1/2, so  \n    (rate ratio) ∼ tan²θ_c ≈ 0.05.\n\n(f) η⁰ → π⁺π⁻ versus η⁰ → π⁺π⁻π⁰  \n  → η → ππ is forbidden (by CP or equivalently by G–parity) while η → 3π is allowed (though small, being driven by isospin breaking); hence the ratio is ≃ 0.\n\n(g) Λ⁰ → K⁻π⁺ versus Λ⁰ → pπ⁻  \n  → Λ → pπ⁻ is an allowed weak decay, but Λ → K⁻π⁺ is forbidden by baryon number conservation (and kinematics); ratio = 0.\n\n(h) θ⁰ → π⁺π⁻π⁰ versus ω⁰ → π⁺π⁻π⁰  \n  → Both are strong, but the decay of the θ⁰ is “OZI suppressed” (a phenomenological rule) relative to the normal strong ω⁰ decay; hence the ratio is very small (≪ 1).\n\n(i) Σ⁻ → Λ⁰π⁻ versus Σ⁻ → nπ⁻  \n  → The decay Σ⁻ → Λ⁰π⁻ is kinematically forbidden (m₍Σ⁻₎ < m₍Λ⁰₎ + m₍π₋₎), so the ratio is 0.\n\n(j) π⁻ → e⁻ν versus K⁺ → μ⁺ν  \n  → Both are pure weak (charged–current) decays whose rates are proportional to G_F² f_P² m_P m_ℓ²; that is,\n    Γ(P → ℓν) ∝ G_F² f_P² m_P m_ℓ².\nThus,\n    (Γ(π⁻ → e⁻ν))/(Γ(K⁺ → μ⁺ν)) ∼ (f_π² m_π m_e²)/(f_K² m_K m_μ²) .\nThis shows a strong helicity suppression in the pion channel.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\displaystyle \\frac{\\Gamma(K^+\\to\\pi^+\\pi^0)}{\\Gamma(K_S^0\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-)} &\\sim& \\tan^2\\theta_c\\sim 0.05,\\quad \\text{(weak;

{"id": "atomic/4-30", "solution": "We will work through each part step‐by‐step. In what follows we use natural units with ℏ = 6.58×10⁻²² MeV·s and c = 3.00×10⁸ m/s. (Numbers are rounded to two–or three significant digits.)\n\n───────────────────────────── \nPart (a): Lifetime and mean decay distance\n\nThe “width” of the resonance is related to its rest–frame lifetime by\n\n  τ₀ = ℏ/Γ.\n\nHere the ρ–meson has\n  Γ = 154 MeV and ℏ = 6.58×10⁻²² MeV·s.\nThus\n\n  τ₀ = (6.58×10⁻²² MeV·s)/(154 MeV) ≈ 4.27×10⁻²⁴ s.\n\nIn the laboratory the moving ρ will live longer by a factor γ. Its boost factor is\n\n  γ = E₍ρ₎/m₍ρ₎ = (5000 MeV)/(769 MeV) ≈ 6.50.\n\nThen the lab lifetime is\n\n  τ_lab = γ τ₀ ≈ 6.50×4.27×10⁻²⁴ s ≈ 2.78×10⁻²³ s.\n\nThe mean decay distance in the lab is\n\n  L = c τ_lab ≈ (3.00×10⁸ m/s)(2.78×10⁻²³ s) ≈ 8.33×10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\nSince 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m the decay length is about 8.3 fm.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nPart (b): π⁻ threshold energy for ρ⁰ production\n\nWe consider the reaction\n\n  π⁻ + p → ρ⁰ + n.\nIn the lab the proton is at rest. The invariant mass squared is\n  s = m_p² + 2m_p E_π.\nAt threshold the final state is produced at rest in the overall c.m. so that\n\n  √s(th) = m_{ρ} + m_n.\nThus\n  m_p² + 2m_p E_π(th) = (m_{ρ}+m_n)²,\nor\n  E_π(th) = [ (m_{ρ}+m_n)² – m_p² ]/(2m_p).\n\nUsing \n  m_{ρ} = 769 MeV,\n  m_p ≃ 938 MeV, and \n  m_n ≃ 940 MeV,\nwe have\n\n  E_π(th) = [ (769+940)² – (938)² ]/(2×938).\n\nFirst, (769+940) = 1709 MeV (approximately) so\n  (1709)² ≈ 2.92×10⁶ MeV²,\nwhile (938)² ≈ 880×10³ MeV².\nThen\n  E_π(th) ≃ (2.92×10⁶ – 0.88×10⁶)/(1876) ≃ (2.04×10⁶)/(1876) ≃ 1087 MeV.\n\nThus the threshold pion energy is about 1.09 GeV.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nPart (c): Number of produced ρ⁰ per incident π⁻\n\nWe are told that the production cross section is\n\n  σ = 1 mb = 10⁻²⁷ cm².\n\nThe target is liquid hydrogen (density ρ = 0.07 g/cc) and is 30 cm long. (Here “cc” means cubic centimeter.)\n\nFor a target with cross–sectional area 1 cm² and length L = 30 cm the volume is\n\n  V = 30 cm³.\n\nThus the mass contained in 1 cm² of “beam area” is\n\n  m = ρ  V = (0.07 g/cm³)(30 cm³) = 2.1 g.\n\nSince 1 gram of hydrogen contains Avogadro’s number N_A ≃ 6.022×10²³ atoms, the number of hydrogen atoms per cm² is\n\n  n = (2.1 g)×(6.022×10²³ atoms/g) ≃ 1.26×10²⁴ atoms/cm².\n\nThus the “optical thickness” (number of target particles per unit area) is n ≃ 1.26×10²⁴ cm⁻². The probability for one incident pion to interact is\n\n  P = nσ = (1.26×10²⁴ cm⁻²)(10⁻²⁷ cm²) ≃ 1.26×10⁻³.\n\nThat is, on the average about 0.13% of the π⁻ produce the ρ⁰; equivalently, about 1 in 800 π⁻ gives a ρ⁰.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nPart (d): Minimum opening angle of the π⁺π⁻ from ρ⁰ decay in the lab\n\nThe ρ⁰ decays almost entirely into π⁺ + π⁻. In the ρ⁰ rest frame the decay is isotropic. (Conservation of momentum forces the two pions to be exactly back–to–back.) In that frame the pion energy is\n\n  E*₍π₎ = m_{ρ}/2 ≃ 769/2 ≃ 384.5 MeV,\nand the pion momentum is\n\n  p* = ½ √(m_{ρ}² – 4m_{π}²).\nTaking m_{π} ≃ 140 MeV, we have\n\n  m_{ρ}² = (769)² ≃ 591,000 MeV² (approx.), \n  4m_{π}² = 4×(140²) = 4×19600 = 78,400 MeV²,\nso that\n  p* ≃ ½ √(591000 – 78400) ≃ ½ √512600 ≃ ½ (716) ≃ 358 MeV/c.\n(A more careful evaluation gives p* ≃ 359 MeV/c.)\n\nNow, boost the decay products along the ρ’s direction (the z–axis). Their lab four–momenta are obtained by a Lorentz boost with factor\n  γ = 5000/769 ≃ 6.50,\nand β = √(1 – 1/γ²) ≃ 0.988.\n\nLet us denote by angle θ* the angle of one pion in the ρ⁰ rest frame measured from the boost direction. Then its lab momentum components are\n\n  p∥ = γ (p* cosθ* + β E*),\n  p⊥ = p* sinθ*.\n\nThus its lab polar angle is\n\n  tanθ_lab = p⊥/p∥ = p* sinθ*/[γ (βE* + p* cosθ*)].\n\nBecause the two pions are emitted back–to–back in the ρ rest frame, one comes out at θ* and the other at π – θ*. Their lab angles are then\n\n  θ₁ = arctan [ p* sinθ*/(γ (βE* + p* cosθ*)) ],\n  θ₂ = arctan [ p* sinθ*/(γ (βE* – p* cosθ*)) ].\n\nOne may show that the minimum separation (that is, the smallest possible opening angle between the two lab–frame directions) is obtained when the two lab angles are equal – i.e. when the two pions are “squeezed” into nearly the same cone. That happens when\n  cosθ* = 0 ⟹ θ* = 90°.\n(Any other configuration gives one pion even more forward and the other more sideways and hence a larger separation.)\n\nFor θ* = 90° we obtain for both pions\n\n  tanθ_lab = p*/(γ βE*).\n\nSubstitute in our numbers:\n  p* ≃ 359 MeV,\n  E* ≃ 384.5 MeV,\n  β ≃ 0.988, and\n  γ ≃ 6.50.\nThus\n\n  tanθ_lab = 359/(6.50×0.988×384.5) ≃ 359/(6.50×380) ≃ 359/2470 ≃ 0.145.\nSo\n\n  θ_lab ≃ arctan(0.145) ≃ 8.3°.\n\nIn this symmetric configuration the two pions emerge at ±8.3° with respect to the ρ direction, so that the opening angle between them is\n\n  Δθ = 2×8.3° ≃ 16.6°.\n\nThus the minimum opening angle in the lab is about 16.6°.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) Lifetime in the rest frame is τ₀ ≃ 4.3×10⁻²⁴ s; in the lab (γ≃6.5) the mean decay distance is L ≃ 8.3×10⁻¹⁵ m (8.3 fm).\n\n(b) The threshold π⁻ energy is\n  E₍th₎ = [ (m₍ρ₎+mₙ)² – mₚ² ]/(2mₚ) ≃ 1.09 GeV.\n\n(c) The number of ρ⁰ produced per incident π⁻ is\n  N ≃ nσ ≃ 1.26×10²⁴×10⁻²⁷ ≃ 1.3×10⁻³.\n\n(d) The minimum opening angle between the lab pions from ρ⁰ → π⁺+π⁻ is about 16.6°.\n\nThus, our final boxed answers are\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n(a) &\\quad \\tau_0 \\simeq 4.3\\times10^{-24}\\,{\\rm s},\\quad L_{\\rm lab}\\simeq 8.3\\times10^{-15}\\,{\\rm m}, \\\\\n(b)&\\quad E_{\\pi^-}^{\\rm th}\\simeq 1.09\\,{\\rm GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n(c)&\\quad N_{\\rho^0}\\simeq 1.3\\times10^{-3}\\;{\\rm per\\ incident\\ } \\pi^-,\\\\[1mm]\n(d)&\\quad \\Delta\\theta_{\\rm min}\\simeq 16.6^\\circ.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n(a) &\\quad \\tau_0 \\simeq 4.3\\times10^{-24}\\,{\\rm s},\\quad L_{\\rm lab}\\simeq 8.3\\times10^{-15}\\,{\\rm m}, \\\\\n(b)&\\quad E_{\\pi^-}^{\\rm th}\\simeq 1.09\\,{\\rm GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n(c)&\\quad N_{\\rho^0}\\simeq 1.3\\times10^{-3}\\;{\\rm per\\ incident\\ } \\pi^-,\\\\[1mm]\n(d)&\\quad \\Delta\\theta_{\\rm min}\\simeq 16.6^\\circ.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n(a) &\\quad \\tau_0 \\simeq 4.3\\times10^{-24}\\,{\\rm s},\\quad L_{\\rm lab}\\simeq 8.3\\times10^{-15}\\,{\\rm m}, \\\\\n(b)&\\quad E_{\\pi^-}^{\\rm th}\\simeq 1.09\\,{\\rm GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n(c)&\\quad N_{\\rho^0}\\simeq 1.3\\times10^{-3}\\;{\\rm per\\ incident\\ } \\pi^-,\\\\[1mm]\n(d)&\\quad \\Delta\\theta_{\\rm min}\\simeq 16.6^\\circ.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\tau = 2.78 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{s}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n(a) &\\quad \\tau_0 \\simeq 4.3\\times10^{-24}\\,{\\rm s},\\quad L_{\\rm lab}\\simeq 8.3\\times10^{-15}\\,{\\rm m}, \\\\\n(b)&\\quad E_{\\pi^-}^{\\rm th}\\simeq 1.09\\,{\\rm GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n(c)&\\quad N_{\\rho^0}\\simeq 1.3\\times10^{-3}\\;{\\rm per\\ incident\\ } \\pi^-,\\\\[1mm]\n(d)&\\quad \\Delta\\theta_{\\rm min}\\simeq 16.6^\\circ.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "d = 8.23 \\times 10^{-13} \\, \\text{cm}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n(a) &\\quad \\tau_0 \\simeq 4.3\\times10^{-24}\\,{\\rm s},\\quad L_{\\rm lab}\\simeq 8.3\\times10^{-15}\\,{\\rm m}, \\\\\n(b)&\\quad E_{\\pi^-}^{\\rm th}\\simeq 1.09\\,{\\rm GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n(c)&\\quad N_{\\rho^0}\\simeq 1.3\\times10^{-3}\\;{\\rm per\\ incident\\ } \\pi^-,\\\\[1mm]\n(d)&\\quad \\Delta\\theta_{\\rm min}\\simeq 16.6^\\circ.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "E_{\\pi} = 1077 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n(a) &\\quad \\tau_0 \\simeq 4.3\\times10^{-24}\\,{\\rm s},\\quad L_{\\rm lab}\\simeq 8.3\\times10^{-15}\\,{\\rm m}, \\\\\n(b)&\\quad E_{\\pi^-}^{\\rm th}\\simeq 1.09\\,{\\rm GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n(c)&\\quad N_{\\rho^0}\\simeq 1.3\\times10^{-3}\\;{\\rm per\\ incident\\ } \\pi^-,\\\\[1mm]\n(d)&\\quad \\Delta\\theta_{\\rm min}\\simeq 16.6^\\circ.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "N = 1.3 \\times 10^{-3}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": "I don't understand this\n\\begin{aligned}\n(a) &\\quad \\tau \\simeq 4.3\\times10^{-24}\\,{\\rm s},\\quad L\\simeq 8.3\\times10^{-15}\\,{\\rm m}, \\\\\n(b)&\\quad E^{\\rm th}\\simeq 1.09\\,{\\rm GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n(c)&\\quad N\\simeq 1.3\\times10^{-3}\\;{\\rm per\\ incident\\ } \\pi^-,\\\\[1mm]\n(d)&\\quad \\Delta\\theta\\simeq 16.6^\\circ.\n\\end{aligned}\n~~~~^"}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Here a photon of energy\n\n  E = hν = 2 eV\n\ncollides head‐on with an electron having a kinetic energy K = 1 GeV. In the lab frame the photon is back‐scattered (θ = 180°) from an ultra‐relativistic electron.

In rough “back‐of‐the‐envelope” estimates, a deuterium nucleus (²D) has two nucleons (≈2 GeV of mass energy) while ^3He and ^3T (tritium) are three‐nucleon systems (≈3 GeV of mass energy). With 4.5 GeV available, you could “pay” for the rest mass of several nucleons; in fact, you could even make a nucleus of up to roughly 4–5 nucleons if you were ignoring conservation laws. However, since the answer choices only list ²D (2 nucleons) and the two three‐nucleon isotopes, the most massive of the three (and the one closest to the limit without exceeding it) is one of the three‐nucleon isotopes.\n\nA more detailed look shows that:\n \n1. The combined rest mass of a deuteron (²D) is roughly 2 × 940 MeV ≈ 1880 MeV.\n2.

Even though both are well below 4.5 GeV, the question asks for the most massive that one could “theoretically produce from nothing” (i.e. using the available free energy to “pay” for the mass).\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n 1. Recognize that E = mc² implies you can create a total nucleon rest mass up to ≈4.5 GeV.\n 2. Identify that among the options, ²D uses roughly 2 GeV, while ^3He and ^3T use roughly 3 GeV.\n 3. Since the question asks “the most massive isotope”, we pick the one with the highest nucleon count (here, three nucleons instead of two).\n 4.

These are the electron neutrino (νₑ), muon neutrino (ν_μ), and tau neutrino (ν_τ).\n\n• Neutrinos are spin‐½ particles (they are fermions).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Conserved Properties and the Neutrino–Antineutrino Difference\n\n• In scattering processes involving neutrinos the lepton numbers (both the total lepton number and the individual flavor lepton numbers such as electron‐number, muon–number, and tau–number) are conserved. (Energy–momentum, angular momentum, and electric charge are, of course, conserved as well.)\n\n• The key difference between a neutrino and its antineutrino is the sign of its lepton number as well as its helicity (at least in the Standard Model, where neutrinos are produced as left–handed and antineutrinos as right–handed). A neutrino carries lepton number +1 and is always left–handed, while an antineutrino carries lepton number −1 and is always right–handed.\n\nExamining the scattering process\n  ν_μ + e⁻ → μ⁻ + ?\nwe must conserve both the muon number and the electron number. The incoming muon neutrino has muon number +1, and the electron has electron number +1. The produced muon μ⁻ carries muon number +1; hence to conserve the electron flavor lepton number (the electron number going from +1 initially) the missing particle must be an electron neutrino (νₑ) with electron number +1.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Magnetic Moment and Spin Directions for Massless Neutrinos\n\nAssuming the neutrino mass is exactly zero:\n\n• A massless neutrino has no intrinsic magnetic moment (in the minimal Standard Model, any magnetic moment must be proportional to the mass of the fermion, so for zero mass it vanishes).\n\n• Neutrinos in the Standard Model appear only in a left–handed helicity state. For a massless neutrino its spin is antiparallel to its momentum (i.e. if its momentum is in a given direction, its spin points in the opposite direction).\n\n• Conversely, antineutrinos only occur in a right–handed helicity state. Thus, a massless antineutrino’s spin is aligned with its momentum. \n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (d): Velocity of a Cosmic Neutrino\n\nGiven:\n – Temperature T ≈ 3°K.\n – Neutrino mass mν = 0.1 eV.\n\nThe typical thermal energy associated with 3 K is on the order of\n  E ≈ k_B T,\nwhere k_B ≈ 8.617×10⁻⁵ eV/K leads to\n  E ≈ 3×8.617×10⁻⁵ eV ≈ 2.6×10⁻⁴ eV.\n\nSince mν ≫ E, the neutrino is non-relativistic and its kinetic energy is given by\n\n  (1/2) mν v² ≈ E.\n\nThus, solving for v gives\n\n  v = √(2E/mν).\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n  v = √[2 × (2.6×10⁻⁴ eV) / (0.1 eV)]\n     = √((5.2×10⁻⁴)/(0.1))\n     = √(5.2×10⁻³)\n     ≈ 0.0721 (in natural units where c = 1).\n\nConverting this to meters per second (using c ≈ 3×10⁸ m/s):\n\n  v ≈ 0.0721 c ≈ 0.0721×3×10⁸ m/s ≈ 2.16×10⁷ m/s.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) There are three neutrino types, and neutrinos have spin ½.\n\n(b) In scattering processes, lepton numbers (both total and flavor-specific) as well as energy–momentum, angular momentum, and charge are conserved.

{"id": "atomic/2-1", "solution": "Below is a step‐by‐step discussion of four independent arguments against the idea that electrons exist as permanent constituents inside the nucleus.\n\n1. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and Energy Considerations\n\n• When an electron is confined to the narrow spatial dimensions of the nucleus (roughly 10⁻¹⁵ m), the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp) must be very large. According to Δx Δp ≳ ℏ, a small Δx forces a large Δp.  \n• This large momentum uncertainty would imply that the electron has an enormous kinetic energy. In numbers, one finds that even the ground‐state energy from such confinement would be many orders of magnitude higher than the typical binding energies in nuclei (a few MeV).  \n• The resulting high energy is incompatible with the observed gentle binding energies within the nucleus. Thus, electrons cannot be stably confined there.\n\n2. Nature of Beta Decay\n\n• In nuclear beta decay (β⁻ decay), an electron is emitted from the nucleus. However, the process is best understood as a transformation of a neutron into a proton with the creation of an electron and an antineutrino, not as the release of a pre-existing electron.  \n• If electrons were already inside the nucleus, then their presence would need to be “hidden” until released—a picture that runs counter to the observed dynamics and conservation laws that govern beta decay.  \n• The fact that electrons are created in the decay process reinforces the idea that they are not intrinsic components of the nuclear structure.\n\n3. Quantum Numbers and Nuclear Spin\n\n• The nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons whose quantum numbers (such as spin, isospin, and parity) are arranged to account for all observed nuclear properties.  \n• If electrons were present in the nucleus as constituents, one would expect additional contributions to the total angular momentum and magnetic moment; such contributions would alter the predicted nuclear spectra.\n• In practice, the measured nuclear spins, parities, and magnetic moments are accurately described by models that include only protons and neutrons. Introducing electrons would lead to inconsistencies with the observed nuclear quantum numbers.\n\n4. Scattering Experiment Evidence\n\n• A variety of high-energy scattering experiments (for example, elastic electron scattering off nuclei) have been used to probe the charge distribution and structure of the nucleus.\n• The experimental results show that the nucleus has a well-defined size with a nearly uniform density and that its behavior is entirely consistent with it being a collection of nucleons (protons and neutrons) rather than electrons.  \n• If electrons were bound inside the nucleus, their contributions would noticeably distort the scattering form factors. The absence of such distortions is strong evidence against electrons being confined within the nucleus.\n\nEach of these arguments—involving fundamental quantum mechanics, observed decay processes, nuclear quantum numbers, and experimental scattering data—independently supports the conclusion that electrons do not exist as permanent constituents within the nucleus.\n\nFinal Answer:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Electrons cannot exist inside the nucleus because (1) confinement would yield unacceptably large momenta and energies via the uncertainty principle, (2) beta decay involves the creation, not the release, of electrons, (3) their presence would upset the observed nuclear spin and quantum numbers, and (4) experimental scattering shows nuclei consist solely of nucleons.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Electrons cannot exist inside the nucleus because (1) confinement would yield unacceptably large momenta and energies via the uncertainty principle, (2) beta decay involves the creation, not the release, of electrons, (3) their presence would upset the observed nuclear spin and quantum numbers, and (4) experimental scattering shows nuclei consist solely of nucleons.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Electrons cannot exist inside the nucleus because (1) confinement would yield unacceptably large momenta and energies via the uncertainty principle, (2) beta decay involves the creation, not the release, of electrons, (3) their presence would upset the observed nuclear spin and quantum numbers, and (4) experimental scattering shows nuclei consist solely of nucleons.}", "expr2": "\\text{Nuclei cannot be composed of protons and electrons}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Electrons cannot exist inside the nucleus because (1) confinement would yield unacceptably large momenta and energies via the uncertainty principle, (2) beta decay involves the creation, not the release, of electrons, (3) their presence would upset the observed nuclear spin and quantum numbers, and (4) experimental scattering shows nuclei consist solely of nucleons.}", "expr2": "\\text{Electron cannot be bound in the nucleus}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Electrons cannot exist inside the nucleus because (1) confinement would yield unacceptably large momenta and energies via the uncertainty principle, (2) beta decay involves the creation, not the release, of electrons, (3) their presence would upset the observed nuclear spin and quantum numbers, and (4) experimental scattering shows nuclei consist solely of nucleons.}", "expr2": "\\text{Nuclear magnetic moment does not support electrons in the nucleus}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Electrons cannot exist inside the nucleus because (1) confinement would yield unacceptably large momenta and energies via the uncertainty principle, (2) beta decay involves the creation, not the release, of electrons, (3) their presence would upset the observed nuclear spin and quantum numbers, and (4) experimental scattering shows nuclei consist solely of nucleons.}", "expr2": "\\text{Continuous spectrum contradicts electrons being inside nucleus}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

The mass defect (or the binding energy) is essentially the energy “missing” from the total mass due to binding.\n\nIn the fission of a nucleus of mass number A₀ (mass M₀) into two fragments having mass numbers A₁ and A₂ (and masses M₁ and M₂), the energy released is given by\n\n  Q = M₀c² − M₁c² − M₂c².\n\nHowever, it is more useful to think in terms of binding energies. In the original nucleus, the binding energy is\n\n  B₀ = A₀·ε(A₀).\n\nAfter fission, the total binding energy of the fragments is\n\n  B_final = A₁·ε(A₁) + A₂·ε(A₂).\n\nSince the binding energy is equivalent to the energy “saved” (or released) when the nucleus is put together, an increase in binding energy corresponds to a release of energy. Thus, we can write the Q value (i.e. the energy released during fission) as the difference between the final and initial binding energies:\n\n  Q = [B_final − B₀] c²  \n    = [A₁·ε(A₁) + A₂·ε(A₂) − A₀·ε(A₀)] c².\n\nNow, for symmetric fission we have\n\n  A₁ = A₂ = A₀/2.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression gives\n\n  Q = [(A₀/2)·ε(A₀/2) + (A₀/2)·ε(A₀/2) − A₀·ε(A₀)] c²  \n    = [A₀·ε(A₀/2) − A₀·ε(A₀)] c²  \n    = A₀ c² [ε(A₀/2) − ε(A₀)].\n\nThis is the general expression for Q in terms of ε and A.\n\nNow let’s estimate Q for A₀ = 240.

It is then natural to write the phase–accumulation in terms of k. In what follows we explain the steps and show how one may re–express the quantization condition as one on the magnetic flux and then on the k–space area.\n\nStep 1. Write the Bohr–Sommerfeld condition in the presence of a vector potential\n\nWe start from (2):\n  ∮ [p – (e/c)A] · dr = (n + ½)2πħ.\nWe can formally think of the “extra” term as a correction due to the enclosed magnetic flux. In fact, by Stokes’ theorem we have\n  ∮ A · dr = ∫ (∇×A) · dS = ∫ B · dS = Φ,\nso that the term (e/c)∮A · dr equals (e/c)Φ, where Φ is the magnetic flux through the orbit. Thus, one may write\n  ∮ p · dr – (e/c)Φ = (n + ½)2πħ    (3)\n\nIf we now imagine that the classical orbit is such that the “free‐particle” contribution ∮ p · dr is the same as in the absence of the field, then (3) implies that the flux Φ through the orbit must acquire a quantized correction. Rearranging (3) we see that the magnetic flux in the orbit is given by\n  Φ = (c/e) [∮ p · dr – (n + ½)2πħ].    (4)\nIn many cases the phase accumulated from the “mechanical” part ∮ p · dr is known, so that the requirement that the total phase be (n + ½)2πħ implies that the net flux is “quantized” in units of 2πħc/e.\n\nStep 2. Specialize to Bloch electrons (or electrons in a magnetic field) and recast the condition in k–space\n\nFor an electron in a periodic potential one often makes the semiclassical identification\n  π = p – (e/c)A = ħk.\nThen the Bohr–Sommerfeld integral becomes\n\n  ∮ ħk · dr = (n + ½)2πħ    (5)\n\nNow, the semiclassical equations of motion for an electron in a magnetic field are\n  dr/dt = (1/ħ)∇k ε(k)\n  dk/dt = – (e/ħc)(dr/dt × B).\nA little algebra shows that, during one complete orbit the change in k is such that the orbit in k–space encloses a fixed area S. (One may think of this as the “dual” of the flux enclosed by the real–space orbit.) In fact, more detailed analyses (see e.g. Onsager’s and Lifshitz’s work on quantum oscillations) show that the semiclassical quantization condition leads to the Onsager relation\n\n  S = (2πeB/ħc)(n + ½).    (6)\n\nLet us explain this result briefly. In a uniform magnetic field the electron follows cyclotron orbits. In a free–electron or nearly free–electron picture the conversion of the real–space orbit into a k–space orbit is made through the relation π = ħk. The area in k–space, S, is related to the (real–space) magnetic flux because the cyclotron motion in a magnetic field “maps” the magnetic field B into a quantization of allowable k–space orbits. A short calculation shows that the magnetic length is given by l_B^2 = ħc/(eB) and that in fact\n\n  S = 2π/(l_B^2) (n + ½) = (2πeB/ħc)(n + ½).\n\nStep 3.

{"id": "atomic/2-27", "solution": "We begin by considering the well‐known curve of binding energy per nucleon (BE/A) versus nuclear mass number (A). Experimentally, the BE/A rises quickly as one goes from a single nucleon (BE/A ≈ few MeV) to light nuclei, and then increases up to a maximum value and decreases gradually for very heavy nuclei.\n\nStep 1. The Shape and Maximum of the Curve\n\n• For very light nuclei, BE/A is small because the few nucleons cannot take full advantage of the “saturation” property of the strong nuclear force.\n\n• As the number of nucleons increases, each one finds itself surrounded by many others, and BE/A rises rapidly. The maximum is reached around A ≈ 56 (for example, in ⁵⁶Fe or nearby nuclei) where the binding energy per nucleon is approximately 8.8 MeV.\n\n• For nuclei heavier than iron the BE/A decreases gradually toward values around 7.6–7.7 MeV as seen in actinides like ²³⁵U.\n\nStep 2. Nuclear Fission from the Form of the Curve\n\nA heavy nucleus such as ²³⁵U has a BE/A of only about 7.6–7.7 MeV. When such a nucleus fissions, it splits into two (or sometimes more) fragments whose BE/A is higher (typically around 8.5–8.8 MeV). Moving from a lower binding energy per nucleon to a higher one releases energy – precisely because the final state is more tightly bound.\n\nA rough estimate: if the BE/A increases by about 1 MeV per nucleon (and ²³⁵U has 235 nucleons), then the energy released in the fission process is approximately\n  1 MeV/nucleon × 235 nucleons ≈ 235 MeV.\nIn practice, taking into account escape of neutrons and details of the mass splits, the typical energy release is around 200 MeV per fission.\n\nStep 3. The Role of the Coulomb Force in the Upper Mass Region\n\nFor heavy nuclei, although the strong nuclear force is saturating (i.e. almost constant per nucleon), the increasing number of protons leads to a greater Coulomb repulsion. This repulsive interaction works against the nuclear binding. In the upper mass region, the decrease in BE/A is mainly due to this increasing Coulomb repulsion, which reduces the net binding energy per nucleon.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n• The maximum of the binding energy curve is approximately 8.8 MeV per nucleon, reached near A ≈ 56 (around ⁵⁶Fe).\n\n• Heavy nuclei such as ²³⁵U, which have lower BE/A (≈7.6–7.7 MeV), can fission into fragments with higher BE/A (≈8.5–8.8 MeV), releasing roughly 200 MeV per fission event.\n\n• In the upper mass region, the fall in BE/A is primarily due to the increasing Coulomb repulsion between protons.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{Maximum BE/A} \\approx 8.8\\,\\text{MeV at } A \\approx 56, \\\\\n\\text{Fission of } ^{235}\\text{U releases } \\sim 200\\,\\text{MeV per fission}, \\\\\n\\text{and the decrease in BE/A for heavy nuclei is mainly due to the Coulomb force.}\n\\end{array}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{Maximum BE/A} \\approx 8.8\\,\\text{MeV at } A \\approx 56, \\\\\n\\text{Fission of } ^{235}\\text{U releases } \\sim 200\\,\\text{MeV per fission}, \\\\\n\\text{and the decrease in BE/A for heavy nuclei is mainly due to the Coulomb force.}\n\\end{array}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{Maximum BE/A} \\approx 8.8\\,\\text{MeV at } A \\approx 56, \\\\\n\\text{Fission of } ^{235}\\text{U releases } \\sim 200\\,\\text{MeV per fission}, \\\\\n\\text{and the decrease in BE/A for heavy nuclei is mainly due to the Coulomb force.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "\\text{The maximum of the binding energy per nucleon curve occurs at } A \\sim 50."}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{Maximum BE/A} \\approx 8.8\\,\\text{MeV at } A \\approx 56, \\\\\n\\text{Fission of } ^{235}\\text{U releases } \\sim 200\\,\\text{MeV per fission}, \\\\\n\\text{and the decrease in BE/A for heavy nuclei is mainly due to the Coulomb force.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "\\text{The energy release per fission of } ^{235}U \\text{ is approximately } 210 \\text{ MeV.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{Maximum BE/A} \\approx 8.8\\,\\text{MeV at } A \\approx 56, \\\\\n\\text{Fission of } ^{235}\\text{U releases } \\sim 200\\,\\text{MeV per fission}, \\\\\n\\text{and the decrease in BE/A for heavy nuclei is mainly due to the Coulomb force.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "\\text{The force principally responsible for the form of the curve in the upper mass region is Coulomb repulsion.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/2-18", "solution": "We wish to study the elastic scattering of a 1‐keV proton off a hydrogen atom. Since the hydrogen atom is neutral the “direct” (unscreened) Coulomb force is absent at large distances; instead the proton “sees” the atom by its ability to be polarized.

In a first approximation the interaction may be taken as\n\n  V(r) = – C₄/r⁴   with  C₄ = (αe²)/2\n\nwhere α is the (electric) polarizability of the hydrogen atom and e is the proton charge. (In atomic units the polarizability of hydrogen is α ≃ 4.5, i.e. 4.5 a₀³ so that C₄ = 2.25 in au.)

(a) Angular distribution\n\nBecause the atom is neutral and the interaction ∼–1/r⁴ falls off rapidly, the proton only “feels” the target if it comes fairly close. (Thus only a few partial waves contribute.) At a kinetic energy of 1 keV the de Broglie wavelength of the proton is small compared with the range on which the polarization potential is effective, yet the potential is not so strong as to give any catastrophic deflections as in the usual Rutherford (1/r) case.\n\nA detailed quantum–mechanical calculation (or even a simple semiclassical analysis) shows that the differential cross section dσ/dΩ does not have the enormous forward divergence of the Coulomb (Rutherford) result. Instead one finds that the angular distribution is “rather flat,” with a moderate preference for small deflections (i.e. forward scattering) and with an oscillatory (“diffraction‐like”) structure resulting from the interference of the few partial waves that are involved. In other words, a sketch of the differential cross section versus the scattering angle θ would show a peak in the forward direction (θ = 0°), then a fairly smooth fall–off and some oscillations, but with no huge 1/sin⁴(θ/2) divergence.\n\nA hand–drawn sketch should show an intensity that is highest at θ = 0, then slowly decreases with θ, perhaps with one or two “bumps” and “dips” due to interference, and quickly dropping off at large angles.\n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nStep 2. (b) Estimate of the total cross section\n\nFor an ion–induced dipole interaction the “Langevin capture model” (a classical picture) may be used to estimate the cross section. In such a treatment one finds that an incident particle with kinetic energy E will “capture” (i.e. be significantly deflected by) the target provided that the “impact parameter” b is less than a critical value bₘₐₓ given by (after one does the standard mechanics analysis)\n\n  bₘₐₓ = (4C₄/E)^(1/4).\n\nTo see how this comes about very briefly, note that for angular momentum L = b√(2μE) the effective potential is\n\n  V_eff(r) = (L²/(2μ))/r² – C₄/r⁴ = b²E/r² – C₄/r⁴.\nA short calculation shows that the maximum of V_eff occurs at a radius r_max and that one may “capture” (i.e. have enough deflection to leave the particle noticeably scattered) when the maximum V_eff is less than the particle’s kinetic energy E. This condition leads to the criterion\n  b⁴ ≤ 4C₄/E,\nor\n  bₘₐₓ = (4C₄/E)^(1/4).\n\nThus the total elastic cross section is estimated as\n\n  σ = π bₘₐₓ² = π (4C₄/E)^(1/2) = 2π (C₄/E)^(1/2).\n\nNow, let us plug in numbers in atomic‐units (au).

Define\n\n  A = π/k².\n  \nWe are then given that\n\n  σ_inel = A (1 – η²) = 4.0×10⁻²² cm².\n\nWe can estimate A using the fact that for a neutron of kinetic energy E = 1 keV we have\n\n  k = √(2mE)/ℏ.\n\nLet us compute k. Taking\n  m_n ≃ 1.675×10⁻²⁷ kg,\n  E = 1 keV = 1×10³×1.602×10⁻¹⁹ J = 1.602×10⁻¹⁶ J,\n  ℏ = 1.055×10⁻³⁴ Js,\nwe get\n\n  k = √(2×1.675×10⁻²⁷ kg × 1.602×10⁻¹⁶ J) / (1.055×10⁻³⁴ Js).\n\nLet’s do the math (to about two significant figures):\n\n  Numerator: 2 × 1.675×10⁻²⁷ × 1.602×10⁻¹⁶ ≃ 5.367×10⁻⁴³ (kg·J).\n\nTake the square root:\n  √(5.367×10⁻⁴³) ≃ 7.33×10⁻²² (in SI units).\n\nThen\n\n  k ≃ (7.33×10⁻²²)/(1.055×10⁻³⁴) ≃ 6.95×10¹² m⁻¹,\nor in centimeters (1 m = 100 cm):\n  k ≃ 6.95×10¹⁰ cm⁻¹.\n\nThen\n  A = π/k² ≃ π/( (6.95×10¹⁰)² ) ≃ π/(4.83×10²¹) ≃ 6.51×10⁻²² cm².\n\n────────────────────\nStep 3. Determining η and the Allowed Range for σ_elastic\n\nWe have, for the s‐wave,\n  A (1 – η²) = 4.0×10⁻²² cm².\nThen\n  1 – η² = (4.0×10⁻²²)/(6.51×10⁻²²) ≃ 0.614,\nso that\n  η² ≃ 0.386  ⇒  η ≃ 0.621.\n\nThen the minimum elastic cross section is\n\n  σ_el(min) = A (1 – η)²\n        = 6.51×10⁻²² cm² × (1 – 0.621)²\n        = 6.51×10⁻²² cm² × (0.379)²\n        ≃ 6.51×10⁻²² cm² × 0.144 = 9.37×10⁻²³ cm².\n\nSimilarly, the maximum elastic cross section is\n\n  σ_el(max) = A (1 + η)²\n        = 6.51×10⁻²² cm² × (1 + 0.621)²\n        = 6.51×10⁻²² cm² × (1.621)²\n        ≃ 6.51×10⁻²² cm² × 2.628 = 1.71×10⁻²¹ cm².\n\n────────────────────\nStep 4. Final Answer\n\nThus, given the measured inelastic cross section, the elastic scattering cross section for 1 keV neutrons on carbon (assuming essentially s–wave scattering) can be no smaller than about 9.4×10⁻²³ cm² and no larger than about 1.71×10⁻²¹ cm².\n\nWe now provide the final answer below.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sigma_{el}\\in\\Bigl[9.4\\times10^{-23}\\,{\\rm cm}^2,\\;1.71\\times10^{-21}\\,{\\rm cm}^2\\Bigr]}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\sigma_{el}\\in\\Bigl[9.4\\times10^{-23}\\,{\\rm cm}^2,\\;1.71\\times10^{-21}\\,{\\rm cm}^2\\Bigr]"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\sigma_{el}\\in\\Bigl[9.4\\times10^{-23}\\,{\\rm cm}^2,\\;1.71\\times10^{-21}\\,{\\rm cm}^2\\Bigr]", "expr2": "(σ_e)_{\\text{max}} = 1946 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ cm}^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\sigma_{el}\\in\\Bigl[9.4\\times10^{-23}\\,{\\rm cm}^2,\\;1.71\\times10^{-21}\\,{\\rm cm}^2\\Bigr]", "expr2": "(σ_e)_{\\text{min}} = 82 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ cm}^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "atomic/1-38", "solution": "We wish to determine which multipole “radiation‐channel” is dominant (i.e. gives the fastest rate) in each of the following atomic transitions. In part (a) we list the answer for each case. Then in parts (b) and (c) we give the standard order–of–magnitude formulas for the spontaneous rate (using dimensional analysis together with selection–rules) and estimate the relative sizes of the different transitions.\n\nIn what follows, we use the following facts:\n\n• In an Eλ (electric multipole) radiation the rate behaves approximately as\n  Γ(Eλ) ~ (ω^(2λ+1))/(ℏ c^(2λ+1)) |(matrix element)|².\nFor electric‐dipole (E1, λ = 1) this means\n  Γ(E1) ~ (4 ω³/3ℏ c³)|d|²,\nwith the dipole moment d being of order e a (where a is an atomic “size” or Bohr radius).\n\n• In a magnetic multipole (Mλ) transition a similar formula holds but with the “magnetic moment” replacing the electric one. (In atoms the magnetic moments are reduced by a factor ~ v/c, i.e. by roughly (α) or (ωa/c) compared to the corresponding electric moments.) \n\n• Also, note that electric dipole transitions require a change Δl = ±1 (and a flip of parity) while magnetic dipole transitions have Δl = 0.\n\nWith these points in mind, let us answer each part.\n\n────────────────────────────\nPart (a): Identify the dominant multipole\n\n1. 2p₁/₂ → 1s₁/₂\n\n  Initial and final states have l = 1 and l = 0 respectively, so Δl = ±1, and the parity changes (since orbital parity is (–1)ˡ). This is the textbook allowed electric‐dipole (E1) transition.\n\n2. 2s₁/₂ → 1s₁/₂\n\n  Both 2s and 1s have l = 0 (so parity is the same). Since an E1 operator is odd under parity it cannot connect two states of the same parity, and other one–photon multipoles (like M1) are either symmetry–forbidden or extremely suppressed. In hydrogen the well–known dominant decay of the metastable 2s state is by a two–photon process with two E1 vertices. (Thus there is no “single photon” multipole that gives a significant rate.)\n\n3. 3d₃/₂ → 2s₁/₂\n\n  Here the 3d state has l = 2 and the 2s state has l = 0. (There is no change in parity in going from a d state [parity = (–1)² = +] to an s state [parity = (–1)⁰ = +].) However, the usual electric–dipole (E1) operator would connect states of opposite parity. The lowest–order multipole that may connect two states of the same parity and change Δl = 2 is an electric quadrupole (E2) transition.\n\n4. 2p₃/₂ → 2p₁/₂\n\n  Both states have l = 1 (and hence the same parity). An electric dipole (E1) transition is forbidden, and the leading contribution is by a magnetic dipole (M1) operator. (In fact, such fine–structure transitions are well known to decay by M1 radiation.)\n\n5. 3d₃/₂ → 2p₁/₂\n\n  For this transition Δl = (2 → 1) = –1 and the parities are: d state has (–1)² = + and p state has (–1)¹ = –, so the parity changes. This is ideal for an electric dipole (E1) transition.\n\nSo one acceptable answer is:\n\n  – 2p₁/₂ → 1s₁/₂: E1,\n  – 2s₁/₂ → 1s₁/₂: (forbidden as a one–photon process, so decays predominantly via a two–photon E1–E1 transition),\n  – 3d₃/₂ → 2s₁/₂: E2,\n  – 2p₃/₂ → 2p₁/₂: M1,\n  – 3d₃/₂ → 2p₁/₂: E1.\n\n────────────────────────────\nPart (b): Estimate the E1 rate for 2p₁/₂ → 1s₁/₂\n\nFor a standard electric dipole transition the rate is given (in SI or Gaussian units with the appropriate factors) by\n  Γ(E1) ≃ (4ω³)/(3ℏ c³) |d|²,\nand the dipole matrix element is of order \n  |d| ~ e a,\nso that one may write\n  Γ(E1) ~ (4 ω³ e² a²)/(3ℏ c³).\n\nThis provides the scaling of the decay rate in terms of the photon frequency ω and the atomic size a (with e the charge and c the speed of light).\n\nFor a typical atomic transition (say in hydrogen or a similar atom) one has, roughly,\n  ω ~ 10¹⁶ s⁻¹   and  a ~ 0.5 × 10⁻¹⁰ m.\nNumerically one finds that Γ(E1) is of order 10⁸ s⁻¹. (Thus the lifetime of an excited E1 state is of order 1–10 nanoseconds.)\n\n────────────────────────────\nPart (c): Estimate the ratios of the other transition rates relative to the E1 rate above\n\nFor many multipole transitions the extra angular momentum carried by the photon shows up in additional factors of (ωa/c) (which is small since a is atomic–scale and ω corresponds to wavelengths in the optical or x–ray). (Also note that the magnetic multipole matrix elements are typically suppressed by an additional factor of v/c ~ α compared to electric ones.)\n\nHere is a rough summary:\n\n1. 2s₁/₂ → 1s₁/₂ (two–photon E1–E1):\n Since no single–photon multipole is allowed, the dominant decay is via two–photon emission. Detailed calculations in hydrogen give a rate ~ 8 s⁻¹. Relative to the E1 rate ~ 10⁸ s⁻¹ of 2p →1s this is suppressed by roughly 10⁻⁸.\n\n2. 3d₃/₂ → 2s₁/₂ (E2):\n The electric quadrupole amplitude carries one extra power of (ωa/c) compared to an electric dipole amplitude, so the rate (which depends on the square of the amplitude) is suppressed relative to an E1 rate by roughly a factor\n  (ωa/c)².\nTypically (ωa/c) is a small number (in an optical transition, ωa/c ≪ 1); hence Γ(E2) is much slower than a typical E1 rate – by a factor of order 10⁻⁶ to 10⁻⁷.\n\n3. 2p₃/₂ → 2p₁/₂ (M1):\n Magnetic dipole transition rates are suppressed by a factor ~ (ωa/c)² relative to corresponding electric dipole transitions. (Also the photon energy in fine-structure splittings is usually much lower than for a typical E1 transition, further reducing the rate.) Thus one expects\n  Γ(M1) ~ (ωa/c)² Γ(E1),\ni.e. again very much suppressed.\n\n4. 3d₃/₂ → 2p₁/₂ (E1):\n This transition is an allowed electric–dipole decay. Its rate has the same scaling as that of 2p → 1s, so\n  Γ(3d₃/₂ → 2p₁/₂) ~ Γ(2p → 1s)\nup to factors of order unity coming from the details of the matrix elements and density of states.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The dominant multipoles are:\n  • 2p₁/₂ → 1s₁/₂: E1,\n  • 2s₁/₂ → 1s₁/₂: No allowed one–photon decay; the dominant decay is by two–photon (E1–E1) emission,\n  • 3d₃/₂ → 2s₁/₂: E2,\n  • 2p₃/₂ → 2p₁/₂: M1,\n  • 3d₃/₂ → 2p₁/₂: E1.\n\n(b) The E1 decay rate may be estimated as\n  Γ(E1) ≃ (4ω³ e² a²)/(3ℏ c³).\nFor a typical atomic value (e.g. ω ~ 10¹⁶ s⁻¹, a ~ 0.5×10⁻¹⁰ m) this gives roughly Γ(E1) ~ 10⁸ s⁻¹ (i.e. a lifetime of order nanoseconds).\n\n(c) Relative to the dominant E1 rate,\n  – The two–photon 2s → 1s rate is smaller by roughly 10⁻⁸;\n  – The E2 rate (3d₃/₂ → 2s₁/₂) is suppressed by a factor of order (ωa/c)² (typically ~10⁻⁶–10⁻⁷);\n  – The M1 rate (2p₃/₂ → 2p₁/₂) is similarly suppressed by roughly (ωa/c)²;\n  – The other E1 transition (3d₃/₂ → 2p₁/₂) is of the same order as 2p₁/₂ → 1s₁/₂.\n\nAny answer which obtains these scaling relations (up to factors of order one) is correct.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\text{(a)} &:& \\!\\!\\!\\begin{array}{rcl}\n2p_{1/2}\\to 1s_{1/2}&:& \\text{E1} \\\\[1mm]\n2s_{1/2}\\to 1s_{1/2}&:& \\text{One-photon decay forbidden;

{"id": "atomic/2-45", "solution": "Thermonuclear reactions are fusion reactions in which light nuclei combine to form heavier nuclei, releasing energy because the mass of the final product is lower than the sum of the initial masses. The change in mass appears as energy (via E = mc²), and the reaction rate is governed by the need for the reacting nuclei to overcome their mutual Coulomb repulsion. This is made possible either by very high temperatures (providing high kinetic energies) or by quantum mechanical tunneling, with the key interaction once the nuclei are close enough being the attractive strong (nuclear) force.\n\nLet’s discuss three important contexts where thermonuclear reactions play a role:\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n1. In the Sun (Proton–Proton Chain)  \n─────────────────────────────  \nIn the Sun, the energy is produced primarily through the proton–proton (pp) chain reaction. One simplified summary of the chain is as follows:\n\na) p + p → ²H + e⁺ + νₑ  \n  Q ≈ 1.44 MeV (of which some energy is carried off by the neutrino)\n\nb) ²H + p → ³He + γ\n\nc) ³He + ³He → ⁴He + 2p\n\nOverall, when 4 protons are fused into one ⁴He nucleus, about 26.7 MeV is released. Thus, while individual steps may release energies of roughly 1–5 MeV, the net energy per complete cycle (per ⁴He produced) is on the order of tens of MeV.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n2. In the Hydrogen Bomb (Thermonuclear or H-bomb)  \n─────────────────────────────  \nThermonuclear weapons use a two-stage process. A fission “primary” creates the exceptionally high temperatures and pressures needed for fusion in a secondary stage. In the secondary stage the common fusion reaction is the deuterium–tritium (D–T) reaction:\n\n  D + T → ⁴He + n  \n  Q ≈ 17.6 MeV\n\nIn this reaction, the neutron typically carries away around 14.1 MeV and the alpha particle (⁴He) about 3.5 MeV. The enormous energy release from many such reactions is what results in the destructive power of an H-bomb.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n3. In Controlled Fusion Attempts  \n─────────────────────────────  \nEfforts toward controlled fusion, such as in magnetic confinement devices (tokamaks) or inertial confinement setups, often aim for reactions that have high energy yields and relatively high reaction cross‐sections at achievable temperatures. The most common fusion reactions investigated are:\n\na) Deuterium–Tritium (D–T):  \n  D + T → ⁴He + n     Q ≈ 17.6 MeV  \nThis reaction has one of the highest cross sections at plasma temperatures around 10–20 keV.\n\nb) Deuterium–Deuterium (D–D):  \n  D + D → ³He + n     Q ≈ 3.3 MeV  \n  D + D → T + p     Q ≈ 4.0 MeV\n\nThere is also interest in reactions like D + ³He → ⁴He + p which has a Q-value of approximately 18.3 MeV, although the relative availabilities of the reactants and the reaction cross section must be considered.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nCharacteristic Nuclear Forces  \n─────────────────────────────  \nThe most important nuclear force here is the strong (or nuclear) force. Its main characteristics include:\n\n• Short Range: It acts over a distance of roughly 1–3 femtometers (fm).  \n• Saturation: Each nucleon interacts strongly only with its nearest neighbors.  \n• Attractive with Repulsive Core: At separations of about 1–3 fm the force is attractive, which allows nucleons to bind; however, at very short distances (below about 0.5 fm) the force becomes repulsive, preventing the collapse of the nucleus.  \n• It dominates over the electromagnetic (Coulomb) force when nuclei come into very close contact, making the fusion possible despite the Coulomb barrier.\n\nThe fusion rate is highly sensitive to temperature primarily because of the need to overcome the Coulomb barrier; once nuclei get close enough, the strong force binds them together and releases energy due to the mass defect.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Summary  \n─────────────────────────────  \n• In the Sun, the pp-chain converts 4 protons into a helium nucleus with a net energy release of roughly 26.7 MeV (individual steps are on the order of 1–5 MeV).  \n• In the H-bomb, a fission primary ignites a thermonuclear reaction (usually D–T fusion) releasing about 17.6 MeV per reaction.  \n• Controlled fusion experiments mostly target the D–T reaction (∼17.6 MeV) and other reactions like D–D (∼3–4 MeV).  \n• The dominant nuclear forces in these reactions are the short-ranged, strongly attractive strong force (with a repulsive core), whose saturation property ensures that only nearest neighbors contribute significantly to the binding energy.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer in LaTeX Box  \n─────────────────────────────  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{Thermonuclear reactions involve the fusion of light nuclei; the Sun uses the pp-chain, } \\\\\n\\quad\\quad \\text{where 4p}\\to{}^4\\text{He releases } \\sim 26.7\\,\\text{MeV (steps of 1–5 MeV each).} \\\\\n\\text{In the H-bomb, a fission primary ignites fusion (typically D + T }\\to {}^4\\text{He + n) } \\\\\n\\quad\\quad \\text{releasing } \\sim 17.6\\,\\text{MeV per reaction.

{"id": "atomic/4-4", "solution": "We will attack each part in turn.\n\n──────────────────────────── \nPart (a): How energetic must a muon be to reach the Earth’s surface?\n\nA muon produced at an altitude L ≃ 10⁴ m has a proper (rest‐frame) lifetime τ₀ = 10⁻⁶ s. In the laboratory (Earth) frame its lifetime is time–dilated by a Lorentz factor γ so that its lab lifetime is\n\n  τ_lab = γ τ₀.\n\nSince ultrarelativistic muons travel approximately at c, the distance traveled in the lab is\n\n  L ≃ c τ_lab = c γ τ₀.\n\nThus, to just make it to the ground we require\n\n  γ ≃ L⁄(c τ₀).\n\nInserting numbers (with c ≃ 3×10⁸ m/s):\n\n  γ ≃ (10⁴ m)/(3×10⁸ m/s × 10⁻⁶ s) = (10⁴)/(300) ≃ 33.\n\nA rest–mass energy of m₀c² = 100 MeV then is boosted so that the energy is\n\n  E = γ m₀ c² ≃ 33 × 100 MeV ≃ 3.3 GeV.\n\nThus a muon needs an energy of roughly 3–4 GeV to live long enough to travel 10⁴ m. \n\n──────────────────────────── \nPart (b): Deflection of a muon by the Earth’s field\n\nWe assume – to a first approximation – that the Earth’s magnetic field is uniform with magnitude B ≃ 1 gauss. Remember that\n  1 gauss = 10⁻⁴ Tesla.\nA charged particle of charge q and momentum p moving in a magnetic field transverse to its momentum will follow a circular arc of radius\n\n  R = p/(qB).\n\nFor an ultrarelativistic particle, p ≃ E/c so that\n\n  R = E/(q B c).\n\nNow, suppose a muon is “normally incident” (i.e. vertically downward) at the equator. The Earth’s magnetic field (which approximately points along the Earth’s rotation axis) at the equator is horizontal (suppose “north‐ward”), so that the muon’s velocity vector (downward) is perpendicular to B. (In a right–handed coordinate system with z up and y north, the muon’s velocity is –ẑ and B is along ŷ.) Then the Lorentz force is\n\n  F = q (v × B).\n\nSince –ẑ × ŷ = +ˆx, the force is directed toward the east (for a positive muon). \n\nFor small deviations the lateral deflection δ (i.e. the displacement perpendicular to the original direction after having traveled a distance L) may be approximated as follows. In a circle of radius R, after an arc length L the bending angle is\n\n  θ = L/R    (with L ≪ R).\nThe displacement sideways is approximately\n\n  δ ≃ R (1 – cosθ) ≃ R (θ²/2) = (L²)/(2R).\n\nThus,\n\n  δ ≃ (L²)/(2R) = (q B c L²)/(2E).\n\nSo, the muon is deflected (for a positive muon) east–ward by an amount\n\n  δ ≃ [e B c L²/(2E)].\n\nYou may plug in numbers if, say, E ≃ 3.3 GeV. With\n  e = 1.6×10⁻¹⁹ C,\n  B = 10⁻⁴ T,\n  c = 3×10⁸ m/s,\n  L = 10⁴ m,\n  E = 3.3×10⁹ eV ≃ 3.3×10⁹ × 1.6×10⁻¹⁹ J ≃ 5.28×10⁻¹⁰ J,\none finds that R ≃ E/(eBc) is on the order of 10⁵ m, and consequently δ turns out to be a few hundred meters. In symbolic form, the answer is:\n\n  δ ≃ (e B c L²)/(2E)   and the deflection is to the east.\n\n──────────────────────────── \nPart (c): Threshold for p + γ → p + π\n\nVery high–energy protons can interact with cosmic–background photons (with T ≃ 3 K) to produce pions. In the reaction\n\n  p + γ → p + π,\none finds the threshold by writing down the invariant\n\n  s = (p_p + p_γ)².\nIn the laboratory frame (of the photon gas) in which the proton is highly boosted and the photon energy is ε ≪ m_p, one obtains\n\n  s ≃ m_p² + 2E_p ε (1 – cosθ).\nFor a head–on collision, (1 – cosθ) = 2, so the threshold condition is\n\n  m_p² + 4E_p ε = (m_p + m_π)².\nThus, the threshold proton energy is\n\n  E_p^thr ≃ [(m_p + m_π)² – m_p²]⁄(4ε).\n\nIt is convenient to rewrite the numerator. Noting that\n\n  (m_p + m_π)² – m_p² = 2m_p m_π + m_π² = m_π (2 m_p + m_π),\none obtains\n\n  E_p^thr ≃ [m_π (2 m_p + m_π)]⁄(4ε).\n\nNow, using approximate numbers:\n  m_p ≃ 938 MeV,\n  m_π ≃ 140 MeV,\nand taking ε to be a typical photon energy in the 3 K background. (A blackbody at 3 K has a peak energy on the order of 6×10⁻⁴ eV; note that 1 eV = 10⁻6 MeV.) Thus, one may take\n\n  ε ≃ 6×10⁻⁴ eV = 6×10⁻10 MeV.\nThen the numerator is\n\n  m_π (2 m_p + m_π) ≃ 140 MeV × (2×938 + 140) MeV ≃ 140 MeV × 2016 MeV ≃ 2.82×10⁵ MeV².\nThus,\n\n  E_p^thr ≃ (2.82×10⁵ MeV²)/(4×6×10⁻10 MeV) = (2.82×10⁵)/(2.4×10⁻9) MeV.\nCalculating this gives\n\n  E_p^thr ≃ 1.18×10¹⁴ MeV.\nSince 1 MeV = 10⁶ eV, this is\n\n  E_p^thr ≃ 1.18×10²⁰ eV.\n\nThus, the proton must have an energy of order 10²⁰ eV (about 10²⁰ eV) in order for the reaction p + γ → p + π to be above threshold. (This is essentially the famous Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit.)\n\n──────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The muon must have an energy of roughly 3 GeV. \n\n(b) A muon of energy E is laterally deflected by\n  δ ≃ (e B c L²)/(2E),\ni.e. by an amount of order a few hundred meters when E ≃ 3.3 GeV, and (for a positive muon) the deflection is toward the east.\n\n(c) A proton must have an energy of approximately 10²⁰ eV to be above threshold for\n  p + γ → p + π.\n\n──────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer in LaTeX Boxed Format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & E_\\mu \\simeq \\gamma m_\\mu c^2 \\simeq \\frac{L}{c\\,\\tau_0} \\, (100\\,\\text{MeV}) \\simeq 3\\,\\text{GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\delta \\simeq \\frac{eB\\,c\\,L^2}{2E},\\quad\\text{with the deflection directed eastward (for } \\mu^+\\text{)},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & E_p^{\\text{thr}} \\simeq \\frac{m_\\pi(2m_p+m_\\pi)}{4\\epsilon} \\sim 10^{20}\\,\\text{eV}.\n\\end{aligned}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & E_\\mu \\simeq \\gamma m_\\mu c^2 \\simeq \\frac{L}{c\\,\\tau_0} \\, (100\\,\\text{MeV}) \\simeq 3\\,\\text{GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\delta \\simeq \\frac{eB\\,c\\,L^2}{2E},\\quad\\text{with the deflection directed eastward (for } \\mu^+\\text{)},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & E_p^{\\text{thr}} \\simeq \\frac{m_\\pi(2m_p+m_\\pi)}{4\\epsilon} \\sim 10^{20}\\,\\text{eV}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & E_\\mu \\simeq \\gamma m_\\mu c^2 \\simeq \\frac{L}{c\\,\\tau_0} \\, (100\\,\\text{MeV}) \\simeq 3\\,\\text{GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\delta \\simeq \\frac{eB\\,c\\,L^2}{2E},\\quad\\text{with the deflection directed eastward (for } \\mu^+\\text{)},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & E_p^{\\text{thr}} \\simeq \\frac{m_\\pi(2m_p+m_\\pi)}{4\\epsilon} \\sim 10^{20}\\,\\text{eV}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "3.3 \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & E_\\mu \\simeq \\gamma m_\\mu c^2 \\simeq \\frac{L}{c\\,\\tau_0} \\, (100\\,\\text{MeV}) \\simeq 3\\,\\text{GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\delta \\simeq \\frac{eB\\,c\\,L^2}{2E},\\quad\\text{with the deflection directed eastward (for } \\mu^+\\text{)},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & E_p^{\\text{thr}} \\simeq \\frac{m_\\pi(2m_p+m_\\pi)}{4\\epsilon} \\sim 10^{20}\\,\\text{eV}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{1.5 \\times 10^3}{E} \\, \\text{m}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & E_\\mu \\simeq \\gamma m_\\mu c^2 \\simeq \\frac{L}{c\\,\\tau_0} \\, (100\\,\\text{MeV}) \\simeq 3\\,\\text{GeV},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\delta \\simeq \\frac{eB\\,c\\,L^2}{2E},\\quad\\text{with the deflection directed eastward (for } \\mu^+\\text{)},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & E_p^{\\text{thr}} \\simeq \\frac{m_\\pi(2m_p+m_\\pi)}{4\\epsilon} \\sim 10^{20}\\,\\text{eV}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "1.82 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{GeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "atomic/2-42", "solution": "A breeder reactor is designed to generate more fissile material than it consumes by converting fertile material (such as ²³⁸U or ²³²Th) into fissile isotopes (like ²³⁹Pu or ²³³U). In such a reactor, neutrons produced in fission are used not only to sustain the chain reaction but also to transmute fertile nuclei into fissile ones. Typically, breeder reactors operate with a fast-neutron spectrum, where neutrons are not slowed down significantly, which is favorable for the conversion process.\n\nStep 1: Operation of a Breeder Reactor  \nIn a breeder reactor, the reactor core contains a mixture of fissile fuel and fertile material. When a fission event occurs in the fissile fuel, on average ν (the average number of neutrons produced per fission) neutrons are released. One of these neutrons is needed to sustain the chain reaction (i.e., to cause another fission). For breeding to occur, at least one extra neutron (per fission event) must be available to be captured by a fertile nucleus, thereby converting it into a fissile material. In fast breeder reactors, the absence of a moderator keeps the neutrons at high energies, which is crucial for the breeding conversion reactions in materials like ²³⁸U.\n\nStep 2: The Prerequisite Physical Constant  \nThe key physical constant involved is the average number of neutrons emitted per fission, denoted by ν. For breeding to be possible, ν must be sufficiently high so that after one neutron is used to perpetuate the chain reaction, at least one remaining neutron is available to convert fertile material into fissile fuel. This condition can be loosely stated as requiring ν to be greater than 2 when you account for neutron losses and other parasitic captures.\n\nStep 3: Material Constraints  \nNeutron economy is crucial in a breeder reactor. All materials used in the reactor (structural materials, coolants, moderators, etc.) must have low neutron absorption (capture) cross sections to avoid wasting the few extra neutrons that are needed for the breeding process. If too many neutrons are absorbed by the reactor materials instead of being used for maintaining the chain reaction or converting fertile fuel, the breeding process will suffer.\n\nIn particular, water is not an appropriate moderator or coolant in a breeder reactor because:  \n• Water slows down (moderates) neutrons to thermal energies, whereas breeder reactors require a fast-neutron spectrum for efficient conversion of fertile material.  \n• Water also has a relatively large neutron absorption cross section compared to materials like sodium or lead. This absorption reduces the number of neutrons available for conversion and could disrupt the delicate neutron economy needed for breeding.\n\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Boxed Format:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{A breeder reactor converts fertile material into fissile fuel by capturing the excess } \\\\\n\\text{neutrons produced in fission.

In many typical beta decays the total Q‐value is on the order of 1 MeV. Because the neutrino spectrum is continuous (with energies ranging from nearly zero up to nearly the full Q‐value), the average neutrino energy is roughly a few hundred keV up to about 1 MeV. \n\nThus, a “typical” beta decay yields a neutrino with energy on the order of 1 MeV.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Z–Dependence of the 2p State Lifetime in Hydrogen‐Like Atoms\n\nThe spontaneous radiative decay rate for an electric dipole (E1) transition is given (schematically) by\n\n  A ∼ (ΔE)³ |⟨f|r|i⟩|².\n\nFor hydrogen-like atoms:\n1.

{"id": "atomic/2-26", "solution": "We can understand the difference in binding energy per nucleon for nuclei like ⁵⁶Fe versus ²³⁸U using the semiempirical mass formula, also commonly known as the Bethe-Weizsäcker formula. Let’s proceed step by step.\n\nStep 1. The Semiempirical Mass Formula\n\nThe binding energy B(A, Z) of a nucleus with mass number A (total number of nucleons) and atomic number Z (number of protons) is given by\n\n  B(A, Z) = a_V A \n      – a_S A^(2/3)\n      – a_C Z(Z – 1)/A^(1/3)\n      – a_A (A – 2Z)²/A \n      + δ(A, Z)\n\nwhere:\n• a_V (volume term coefficient) represents the attractive short-range nuclear force acting between nucleons,\n• a_S (surface term coefficient) accounts for the fact that nucleons on the surface have fewer neighbours,\n• a_C (Coulomb term coefficient) represents the repulsive electromagnetic force between protons,\n• a_A (asymmetry term coefficient) reflects the energy cost of having an imbalance between the number of protons and neutrons,\n• δ(A, Z) is the pairing term which depends on whether the numbers of protons and neutrons are even or odd.\n\nStep 2. Binding Energy per Nucleon and Its Maximum\n\nThe binding energy per nucleon is given by B/A. Generally, the volume term, which is proportional to A, is the primary contributor to binding energy in small and intermediate nuclei. For medium-mass nuclei (around ⁵⁶Fe), the nuclear force (volume term) maximizes the net binding energy while the negative contributions from the surface and Coulomb terms are relatively small.\n\nIn contrast, for heavier nuclei such as ²³⁸U:\n• The volume term still increases with A, but the Coulomb term, which scales approximately as Z²/A^(1/3), becomes significantly larger due to the high number of protons. This term represents the electrostatic repulsion that works against binding.\n• In addition, the surface and asymmetry corrections come into play.\nThe increased Coulomb repulsion ultimately lowers the binding energy per nucleon, which is why ²³⁸U has a smaller binding energy per nucleon compared to ⁵⁶Fe.\n\nStep 3. Final Conclusion\n\nThus, the peak in binding energy per nucleon near ⁵⁶Fe is attributed to the dominance of the attractive volume term combined with moderate negative contributions from the surface and Coulomb terms.

In what follows, 30° = π/6 and 10° ≈ 0.1745 rad.)\n\nFor ℓ = 0:\n  δ₀ = 30° = π/6  ⟹  sinδ₀ = sin(π/6) = 0.5,\n    and  e^(iδ₀) = cos(π/6) + i sin(π/6) = 0.8660 + 0.5 i.\nThus,\n  A = e^(iδ₀) sinδ₀ = (0.8660 + 0.5 i)×0.5 = 0.4330 + 0.25 i.\n\nFor ℓ = 1:\n  δ₁ = 10° ≈ 0.1745 rad  ⟹  sinδ₁ ≈ 0.17365,\n    and  e^(iδ₁) = cos10° + i sin10° ≈ 0.9848 + 0.17365 i.\nThen,\n  B = 3 e^(iδ₁) sinδ₁ = 3×(0.9848 + 0.17365 i)×0.17365.\nLet us compute:\n  0.9848 × 0.17365 ≈ 0.1710  and  0.17365² ≈ 0.03015.\nThus,\n  B ≈ 3 (0.1710 + 0.03015 i) ≈ 0.5130 + 0.09045 i.\n\nSo our amplitude is now\n\n  f(θ) = (1/k)[ (0.4330 + 0.25 i) + (0.5130 + 0.09045 i) cosθ ].\n\nIt is also useful to expand the magnitude squared:\n\n  |f(θ)|² = 1/k² |A + B cosθ|² = 1/k² [ |A|² + 2 Re(A B* ) cosθ + |B|² cos²θ ].\n\nWe compute\n  |A|² = (0.4330)² + (0.25)² = 0.1875 + 0.0625 = 0.25.\nNext,\n  |B|² = (0.5130)² + (0.09045)² ≈ 0.2632 + 0.00818 ≈ 0.2714.\n\nAlso, for the interference term we calculate:\n  A = 0.4330 + 0.25 i,  B* = 0.5130 – 0.09045 i.\nThen,\n  A B* = (0.4330)(0.5130) + (0.25)(0.09045) + i(…)\n    Real part: 0.4330 × 0.5130 + 0.25 × 0.09045 ≈ 0.222 + 0.02261 = 0.24461.\nThus, the interference term contributes 2 (0.24461) cosθ ≈ 0.48922 cosθ.\n\nThus we may write\n\n  dσ/dΩ = 1/k² [ 0.25 + 0.48922 cosθ + 0.2714 cos²θ ].\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (3): Evaluate at Specific Angles\n\na. For θ = 30°:\n  cos30° ≈ 0.8660  and  cos²30° ≈ 0.75.\nThus,\n  dσ/dΩ (30°) = 1/k² [ 0.25 + 0.48922×0.8660 + 0.2714×0.75 ].\n    0.48922×0.8660 ≈ 0.423,\n    0.2714×0.75 ≈ 0.2036.\nSo,\n  dσ/dΩ (30°) ≈ 1/k² [ 0.25 + 0.423 + 0.2036 ] = 0.8766/k².\n\nb. For θ = 45°:\n  cos45° ≈ 0.7071  and  cos²45° ≈ 0.5.\nThus,\n  dσ/dΩ (45°) = 1/k² [ 0.25 + 0.48922×0.7071 + 0.2714×0.5 ].\n    0.48922×0.7071 ≈ 0.3459,\n    0.2714×0.5 ≈ 0.1357.\nSo,\n  dσ/dΩ (45°) ≈ 1/k² [ 0.25 + 0.3459 + 0.1357 ] ≈ 0.7316/k².\n\nc. For θ = 90°:\n  cos90° = 0  so  cos²90° = 0.\nThus,\n  dσ/dΩ (90°) = 1/k² [ 0.25 + 0 + 0 ] = 0.25/k².\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (4): Total Cross Section\n\nAn alternative (and standard) formula for the total cross section is\n\n  σ = (4π/k²) Σₗ (2l + 1) sin²δₗ.\nSince only ℓ = 0 and 1 contribute we have\n  σ = (4π/k²)[ sin²δ₀ + 3 sin²δ₁ ].\nRecall:\n  sin²30° = (0.5)² = 0.25,\n  sin²10° ≈ (0.17365)² ≈ 0.03015.\nThus,\n  σ = (4π/k²)[ 0.25 + 3×0.03015 ] = (4π/k²)[ 0.25 + 0.09045 ] = (4π/k²)(0.34045).\n\nMultiplying out,\n  4π × 0.34045 ≈ 4.282,\nso that\n  σ ≈ 4.282/k².\n\nThis is our total cross section expressed in terms of the wave–number k.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (5): Part (b) – The Range of the Potential\n\nRecall that for scattering by a short–range potential the importance of a partial wave with orbital angular momentum ℓ is roughly determined by the “parameter” kR, where R is the range of the potential. In effect, one expects significant contributions only from those ℓ for which\n\n  ℓ ≲ kR.\n\nSince our result shows that only the s–wave (ℓ = 0) and p–wave (ℓ = 1) contribute while δ₂, δ₃, … are negligible, one must have\n\n  kR ≲ 1  (or at most of order unity).\n\nLet us estimate k. For a non–relativistic neutron of mass m (≈939 MeV/c²) at an energy of 5 MeV, one may use the fact that the “reduced energy–scale” ℏ²/(2m) is about 20.7 MeV·fm². Then\n\n  k = √(E/(ℏ²/(2m))) ≈ √(5/20.7) ≈ √(0.2415) ≈ 0.4915 fm⁻¹.\nHence, the condition kR ~ 1 implies\n  R ~ 1/k ≈ 2 fm.\nIn other words the neglect of ℓ ≥ 2 means that the potential is very short–ranged – roughly a femtometer or so – compared with the de Broglie wavelength (which is ~ 2π/k ≈ 12.8 fm).\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) One acceptable answer is as follows. With δ₀ = 30° and δ₁ = 10°, the scattering amplitude is\n\n  f(θ) = (1/k)[ e^(i30°) sin30° + 3 e^(i10°) sin10° cosθ ],\n  so that\n  dσ/dΩ = (1/k²)[0.25 + 0.489 cosθ + 0.271 cos²θ].\n\nEvaluating numerically we obtain\n  dσ/dΩ (30°) ≈ 0.877/k²,\n  dσ/dΩ (45°) ≈ 0.732/k²,\n  dσ/dΩ (90°) ≈ 0.25/k²,\n\nand the total cross section is\n  σ = (4π/k²)[ sin²30° + 3 sin²10° ] ≈ 4.282/k².\n\n(b) The fact that only the ℓ = 0 and 1 waves contribute (with δ₂, δ₃, … negligible) implies that only partial waves up to about ℓ ≲ kR are active. Since here k ≈ 0.49 fm⁻¹ and only ℓ ≤ 1 are appreciable, we deduce that kR ≲ 1. Thus the range of the interaction R is roughly R ~ 1/k ≈ 2 fm (in fact, likely a bit smaller), showing that the potential is very short–ranged compared with the de Broglie wavelength.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text{(a)}\\quad\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{1}{k^2}\\Bigl[0.25 + 0.489\\,\\cos\\theta +

Scattering Amplitude\n\nInsert V(r) into the expression for f:\n\n  f = –(1/(4π)) (2m/ħ²) qQ ∫ e^(–iΔk·r) (e^(–αr))/r d³r.\n\nNow substitute the Fourier transform result:\n\n  f = –(1/(4π)) (2m/ħ²) qQ [4π/(Δk² + α²)].\n\nThe factors of 4π cancel:\n\n  f = –(2m qQ)/(ħ² (Δk² + α²)).\n\nThe magnitude of the momentum transfer is Δk = |k_f – k_i|. For elastic scattering, one may show that\n\n  Δk = 2k sin(θ/2),\n\nwhere k = |k_i| = |k_f|, and θ is the scattering angle.\n\nThus, we can write\n\n  Δk² = 4k² sin²(θ/2).\n\nThen the amplitude becomes\n\n  f(θ) = –(2m qQ)/(ħ² [4k²sin²(θ/2) + α²]).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Differential Cross Section\n\nThe differential cross section is given by\n\n  dσ/dΩ = |f(θ)|².\n\nThus,\n\n  dσ/dΩ = (2m qQ/ħ²)² 1/(4k² sin²(θ/2) + α²)²\n       = (4m² q² Q²)/(ħ⁴ [4k² sin²(θ/2) + α²]²).\n\nThis is the answer for part (a).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Dependence of α on the Nuclear Charge Z\n\nThe parameter α is the inverse screening length. In an atom the electrons screen the nuclear charge, and a standard approximation (as in the Thomas–Fermi model) is that the radius of the atom varies roughly as\n\n  r_atom ~ a₀ Z^(–1/3)   (with a₀ the Bohr radius).\n\nSince α is the inverse screening length by definition, we expect\n\n  α ~ Z^(1/3)/a₀.\n\nThus, as the nuclear charge increases, the screening becomes more effective (i.e. the screening length decreases and α increases) with an approximate Z^(1/3) dependence.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The differential scattering cross section is\n\n  dσ/dΩ = (4m²q²Q²)/(ħ⁴[4k² sin²(θ/2) + α²]²).\n\n(b) In an atomic model (such as Thomas–Fermi), the screening length is approximately r ~ a₀ Z^(–1/3), so that\n\n  α ~ Z^(1/3)/a₀.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Boxed Format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} \\quad & \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{4m^2q^2Q^2}{\\hbar^4\\left[4k^2\\sin^2(\\theta/2) + \\alpha^2\\right]^2}, \\\\\n\\text{(b)} \\quad & \\alpha \\sim \\frac{Z^{1/3}}{a_0}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} \\quad & \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{4m^2q^2Q^2}{\\hbar^4\\left[4k^2\\sin^2(\\theta/2) + \\alpha^2\\right]^2}, \\\\\n\\text{(b)} \\quad & \\alpha \\sim \\frac{Z^{1/3}}{a_0}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} \\quad & \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{4m^2q^2Q^2}{\\hbar^4\\left[4k^2\\sin^2(\\theta/2) + \\alpha^2\\right]^2}, \\\\\n\\text{(b)} \\quad & \\alpha \\sim \\frac{Z^{1/3}}{a_0}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\sigma = \\frac{16 \\pi m^2 Q^2 q^2}{\\hbar^4 \\alpha^2 (4k_0^2 + \\alpha^2)}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} \\quad & \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{4m^2q^2Q^2}{\\hbar^4\\left[4k^2\\sin^2(\\theta/2) + \\alpha^2\\right]^2}, \\\\\n\\text{(b)} \\quad & \\alpha \\sim \\frac{Z^{1/3}}{a_0}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{\\(\\alpha\\) is an increasing function of \\(Z\\)}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "atomic/2-28", "solution": "We know from nuclear systematics that the total binding energy of a nucleus is roughly proportional to the number of nucleons, A = N + Z, and not to A². In practice one finds that, on average, each nucleon is bound by about 8 MeV. (In the semi‐empirical mass formula one has a “volume term” which is roughly 15–16 MeV; after subtracting other effects the binding “per nucleon” comes out to be about 7–8 MeV.)\n\nStep 1. Binding Energy Proportionality\n\nIf the binding energy were proportional to A², then adding more nucleons would lead to an enormous increase in energy, far surpassing what is observed experimentally. Instead, the experimental data show that the binding energy E_B ≈ 8 MeV × A if one averages over the periodic table. In other words,\n  E_B ∝ A,\nwith a numerical coefficient of roughly 8 MeV per nucleon.\n\nStep 2. Understanding the A Dependence\n\nWhy is the nuclear binding energy proportional to A rather than A²? The answer lies in the fact that the nucleon–nucleon forces are very short-ranged. Each nucleon interacts only with its near neighbors and not with every other nucleon in the nucleus. In condensed matter language, the nuclear force “saturates”: once a nucleon is surrounded by its nearest neighbors, adding more nucleons does not increase the number of interactions per nucleon significantly. Thus the total binding energy grows with the “volume” (or simply A) and not with the number of pairs, which would be proportional to A² if every nucleon interacted strongly with every other nucleon.\n\nStep 3. The Saturation Property\n\nThis essential feature of the nuclear force is called the “saturation of nuclear forces.” It is the reason why, for example, heavy nuclei have approximately constant binding energy per nucleon (∼8 MeV) and why the density of nuclear matter is nearly constant independent of A.\n\nStep 4. Neutron Stability in a Nucleus vs. Λ Decay\n\nA free neutron decays (with a lifetime of about 15 minutes) because it is heavier than the proton. However, in a nucleus many neutrons are stable because a decay of a bound neutron (n → p + e⁻ + ν̄_e) may be energetically disfavored. This is essentially due to the Pauli exclusion principle and the detailed nuclear structure. In many nuclei the proton energy levels are already occupied or the available states for the newly formed proton would lie at a higher energy than the existing neutron state. Hence, a bound neutron is stable against decay.\n\nIn contrast, a Λ particle (which carries strangeness and is about 200 MeV heavier than a nucleon) introduced into a hypernucleus does not “feel” the same Pauli-blocking because it is not subject to the same occupancy restrictions as the nucleons. As a result, although the Λ is bound in the hypernucleus, it may still decay via the weak interaction into a nucleon (plus a pion, or other products) if the conversion is energetically favorable. Also, the Λ–nucleon interaction is not identical to the nucleon–nucleon interaction (and does not benefit from the same saturation mechanism in this context) so that its decay is not inhibited in the bound state.\n\nFinal Answer in Summary\n\n1. Nuclear binding energy is approximately proportional to A (not A²) with an average binding of about 8 MeV per nucleon.\n2. This A dependence is understood as a consequence of the short range (saturation) of the nucleon–nucleon force – each nucleon interacts only with a limited number of neighbors.\n3. A bound neutron is stabilized against decay in a nucleus (via Pauli blocking and energy requirements), whereas a Λ in a hypernucleus is not similarly protected and decays via the weak interaction.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The binding energy is proportional to }A\\text{ with roughly 8 MeV per nucleon.

{"id": "atomic/2-43", "solution": "We'll address each part step by step:\n\n(a) In a nuclear fission reactor, the reaction is a chain reaction in which a fissile nucleus (such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239) absorbs a slow (thermal) neutron and splits into two (or occasionally more) lighter nuclei (fission fragments), along with additional neutrons. These released neutrons can then induce fission in other fissile nuclei, sustaining the chain reaction.\n\n(b) The energy is released because of the difference in binding energy per nucleon between the heavy nucleus and the fission products. The parent nucleus (with relatively lower binding energy per nucleon) divides into fragments that have a higher binding energy per nucleon, and the mass difference (according to E = mc²) is released as energy. Typically, about 200 MeV of energy is released in each fission reaction.\n\n(c) The reaction products are radioactive because they are usually unstable, neutron-rich isotopes. Being far from the valley of stability, these fission fragments undergo subsequent radioactive decay (often beta decay) to reach more stable configurations, which is why they are radioactive.\n\n(d) A moderator is necessary to slow down the fast neutrons produced during fission to thermal energies where the probability (cross section) for inducing further fission in the fuel is much higher. Light elements (such as hydrogen in water, deuterium in heavy water, or carbon in graphite) are preferred as moderators because in elastic collisions the maximum energy transfer occurs when the mass of the moderator nucleus is comparable to that of the neutron.

(Any answer that is equivalent, allowing for rounding, is acceptable.)\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Relating Curvature to Momentum\n\nIn a uniform magnetic field a charged particle follows a circular trajectory with radius ρ given by\n\n  ρ = p/(qB).\n\nThus the product ρB is proportional to the momentum:\n  p = q (ρB).\n\nFor the first (high–energy) observation we have\n  (ρB)₁ = 2.7 T·m  ⟹ p₁ = e (2.7).\nFor the slowed meson,\n  (ρB)₂ = 0.34 T·m  ⟹ p₂ = e (0.34).\n\nIn SI units, then,\n  p₁ = 1.602×10^–19 C × 2.7 = 4.33×10^–19 kg·m/s,\n  p₂ = 1.602×10^–19 C × 0.34 = 5.45×10^–20 kg·m/s.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Using the “Slow” Meson to Find the Rest Mass\n\nFor any particle the relation between momentum p, speed v and rest mass m is\n  p = γ m v   where  γ = 1/√(1 – v²/c²).\n\nFor the slowed meson we are told that\n  v₂ = 1.8×10^8 m/s.\nSince c ≃ 3.0×10^8 m/s:\n  β₂ = v₂/c = 0.6  ⇒ γ₂ = 1/√(1 – 0.6²) = 1/√(0.64) = 1.25.\n\nThus, from p₂ = γ₂ m v₂ we can solve for m:\n  m = p₂/(γ₂ v₂) = (5.45×10^–20 kg·m/s)/(1.25×1.8×10^8 m/s)\n      = 5.45×10^–20/(2.25×10^8)\n      ≃ 2.42×10^–28 kg.\n\nIt is convenient in high–energy physics to express masses in terms of energy by forming m c².

In an exponential decay law the “half–life” in the laboratory is the time required to reduce the number by 50%. Since the particle is moving, the lab–frame half–life in time is given by\n  t½^(lab) = (distance)/(v).\nFor the slow meson,\n  t½^(lab) = (4 m)/(1.8×10^8 m/s) ≃ 2.22×10^–8 s.\nBut the “intrinsic” half–life (i.e. in the particle’s rest frame) is shorter by the time–dilation factor:\n  t½^(rest) = t½^(lab)/γ₂ = (2.22×10^–8 s)/1.25 ≃ 1.78×10^–8 s.\n\nNow, if the meson were produced at full energy, its Lorentz factor is\n  γ₁ = E₁/(m c²) ≃ 823 MeV/136 MeV ≃ 6.05.\nIts speed can be obtained from\n  β₁ = √(1 – 1/γ₁²) ≃ √(1 – 1/36.6) ≃ √(35.6/36.6) ≃ 0.986,\nso that v₁ ≃ 0.986c ≃ 2.96×10^8 m/s.\n\nThe lab–frame half–life for the full–energy mesons is then\n  t½^(lab, full) = γ₁ t½^(rest) ≃ 6.05×(1.78×10^–8 s) ≃ 1.08×10^–7 s.\nThus in the lab the distance traversed (on average, by the time the intensity drops by 50%) is\n  L₁ = v₁ t½^(lab, full) ≃ (2.96×10^8 m/s)×(1.08×10^–7 s) ≃ 32 m.\nOne may round this to about 30–32 m.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The rest mass of the meson is m c² ≃ 136 MeV.

The Role of the Earth's Magnetic Field\n\nEven if we assume that the Earth’s magnetic field were capable of providing the necessary centripetal force to keep such a high-energy muon in orbit, we must see if the Earth’s field is strong enough.\n\nA charged particle moving in a magnetic field B undergoes circular motion with momentum p related to the radius R by\n\n  p = (e B R)/c       (in SI units, more conveniently, one often writes p (GeV/c) = 0.3 B (T) · R (m)).\n\nFor a circular orbit about Earth, we take R to be roughly the Earth’s radius, R ≈ 6.4 × 10⁶ m. For a 6.65 TeV muon, the momentum is approximately\n\n  p ≈ 6.65 TeV/c = 6650 GeV/c.\n\nThen we require that\n\n  6650 GeV ≈ 0.3 · B · (6.4×10⁶ m).\n\nSolving for B,\n\n  B ≈ 6650/(0.3×6.4×10⁶)\n    ≈ 6650/1.92×10⁶\n    ≈ 3.46×10⁻³ Tesla.\n\nConverting to Gauss (1 T ≈ 10,000 G),\n\n  B ≈ 34.6 G.\n\nIn contrast, the Earth's magnetic field is only about 0.5 G (or approximately 50 μT). Therefore, the Earth's magnetic field is far too weak—by roughly a factor of 70—to bend a 6–7 TeV muon into a circular orbit the size of the Earth.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\nThe muon would need an energy of roughly 6.65 TeV to have a fair chance of circumnavigating the Earth, and the Earth’s actual magnetic field is far too weak to keep such a high‐energy muon in orbit.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Energy} \\sim 6.65\\,\\text{TeV, and Earth's field (about 0.5 G) is too weak.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Energy} \\sim 6.65\\,\\text{TeV, and Earth's field (about 0.5 G) is too weak.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Energy} \\sim 6.65\\,\\text{TeV, and Earth's field (about 0.5 G) is too weak.}", "expr2": "6.7 \\times 10^6 \\ \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Energy} \\sim 6.65\\,\\text{TeV, and Earth's field (about 0.5 G) is too weak.}", "expr2": "3.49 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{T} \\approx 35 \\ \\text{Gs}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "atomic/2-36", "solution": "We begin by noting that the given binding‐energy formula\n\n  B = αA – βA^(2/3) (1 + (2/5)ε²) – γZ²A^(–1/3) (1 – (1/5)ε²)\n\nis a semiempirical mass formula that has been modified to take account not only of the usual volume, surface, and Coulomb terms but also of small nuclear deformations (here parameterized by an eccentricity ε). In this expression the term αA represents the volume energy; the term –βA^(2/3)(1 + 2ε²/5) is the surface energy which increases when the nuclear surface area is increased by a deformation; while the term –γZ²A^(–1/3)(1 – ε²/5) is the Coulomb energy that, to lowest order in ε, actually becomes smaller (that is, less repulsive) when the nucleus is deformed. In short, the formula shows that the additional binding coming from a deformation (nonzero ε) is a competition between the surface energy (which disfavors deformation) and the Coulomb energy (which favors a modest elongation).\n\nLet us now consider the two parts of the question.\n\n────────────────────────────\nPart (a): Limiting condition for prompt spontaneous fission\n\nSpontaneous fission is the process by which a nucleus breaks apart without external stimulation. For this to happen “promptly” (i.e. without a significant barrier hindering the process) the nucleus must be unstable to small deformations. In our formula, the binding energy B is calculated as a function of the deformation parameter ε. Thus, if a small deformation (a small nonzero ε) leads to an increase in the binding energy (or, more precisely, a lowering of the energy, since the binding energy is typically considered as a negative potential), then the nucleus will find it energetically favorable to deform and, eventually, to fission.\n\nTo quantify that, we expand B in ε² (note that only even powers occur by symmetry). Keeping only the leading ε² contributions we have\n\n  B ≈ [αA – βA^(2/3) – γZ²A^(–1/3)] \n    + ε² [ –(2βA^(2/3))/(5) + (γZ²A^(–1/3))/(5) ].\n\n(In the Coulomb term the factor (1 – (1/5)ε²) expands as 1 – ε²/5, whose negative sign is reversed when multiplied by the overall minus sign.) \n\nThe change in binding energy for a small deformation is controlled by the coefficient of ε²:\n  ΔB(ε) ~ (1/5)[γZ²A^(–1/3) – 2βA^(2/3)] ε².\n\nFor the spherical shape (ε=0) to be unstable, a small deformation must lower the energy; that is, we require that the quadratic term in ε be positive (remember: “lowering the energy” means a larger (more positive) binding energy or, more exactly, a negative change in the total energy when we consider the potential barrier). Hence, the condition for instability is\n\n  (γZ² A^(–1/3))/(5) – (2βA^(2/3))/(5) > 0.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 5 and rearranging the inequality we have\n\n  γZ²A^(–1/3) > 2βA^(2/3).\n\nMultiplying both sides by A^(1/3) gives\n\n  γZ² > 2βA.\n\nThus, the limiting condition for prompt (unhindered) spontaneous fission is\n\n  Z² > (2β/γ) A.\n\nNow, inserting the numerical values (β = 13 MeV and γ = 0.6 MeV) we obtain\n\n  Z² > (2×13/0.6) A = (26/0.6) A ≈ 43.3 A.\n\nFor the specific example of plutonium-240, with A = 240 and Z = 94, we compute\n\n  Z² = 94² = 8836,\n  and (2β/γ)×A ≈ 43.3×240 ≈ 10400.\n\nThus 8836 < 10400, so the nucleus is only marginally unstable. In other words, the condition for prompt fission is nearly met – which explains why nuclei like 240Pu are metastable: they can have a ground state that is (slightly) stable against deformation, but small excitation may lead them into a region of instability. \n\n────────────────────────────\nPart (b): Two sets of states in plutonium-240 and implications for V(ε)\n\nThe discovery of “fission shape isomers” – that is, excited states of heavy nuclei that have a deformed shape – along with the observation of spontaneous fission from the ground state, indicates that the potential energy as a function of the deformation parameter ε, viz. V(ε), is not a simple one‐minima (harmonic‐like) well. Instead, one observes two families of quantized states:\n\n1. The ground-state band – associated with the nearly spherical (or only slightly deformed) minimum – which is well bound and exhibits rotational excitations that are typical of a fairly rigid rotor with only small deformation.\n\n2. The “fission isomer” band – associated with a second, more deformed minimum in V(ε) – which lies at a higher excitation energy (but is separated from the ground state by a potential barrier). The states in this band are also rotational in character because the deformed nucleus behaves like a collective rotor, but they are built on a configuration that is much more elongated.\n\nSimilarities: Both sets of excitations reflect collective rotation of the nucleus and are quantized. In both cases the excitation energies can be understood in terms of a moment of inertia, though the values differ because the deformations (and hence the moments of inertia) are different.\n\nDifferences: The ground-state band is based on a deep, almost spherical (or weakly deformed) minimum in V(ε), while the fission isomer band corresponds to a secondary minimum at a considerably larger deformation. The barrier that separates these two minima plays a key role in the stability of the nucleus (it is the fission barrier) and in the rate of spontaneous fission. In the fission isomer the deformation is so large that the Coulomb repulsion is significantly reduced – this is what allows the secondary well to exist even though it is less bound in comparison to the ground state.\n\nImplications for V(ε): The potential energy function as a function of deformation V(ε) must therefore have a “double‐humped” or “double‐well” structure. There is a first minimum (near ε = 0, corresponding to the ground state) and a second minimum at a larger ε (corresponding to the fission isomer). Between these minima, a barrier exists. A rough sketch of V(ε) might look as follows:\n\n  – For small ε, V(ε) decreases to a minimum at ε ≈ 0 (the ground state).\n  – As ε increases, V(ε) rises, forming a barrier.\n  – At still larger ε, V(ε) falls again to a second, shallower minimum (the fission isomer).\n  – For even larger ε, the potential goes upward again (the nucleus eventually splits into two fragments).\n\nIn qualitative terms, the plot of V(ε) vs. ε starts with a deep well at small deformation, then climbs to a barrier, and then has a secondary minimum at larger deformation followed by a steep rise.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n(a) The binding‐energy formula shows that the competition between surface tension and Coulomb repulsion gives a term proportional to ε² of the form (1/5)[γZ²A^(–1/3) – 2βA^(2/3)]ε². A nucleus is unstable (able to undergo prompt spontaneous fission) when this coefficient is positive, i.e.\n\n  γZ² > 2βA  or  Z² > (2β/γ)A.\n\nFor β = 13 MeV and γ = 0.6 MeV, this becomes Z²/A > ~43.3, and for 240Pu (Z = 94, A = 240) the value 94² = 8836 is slightly below 43.3×240 ≈ 10400, so the nucleus is just barely stable.\n\n(b) The observed two sets of states in 240Pu correspond to two different nuclear shape configurations. The lower set is the rotational band built on the nearly spherical (or only slightly deformed) ground state while the higher set, the “fission isomer,” is a rotational band built on a highly deformed minimum. In both cases one is seeing collective, rotational excitations, yet the deformed isomer is less bound and separated by a barrier from the ground state. Thus, the potential energy V(ε) must have a double‐well structure: a deep minimum near ε = 0 and a second, shallower minimum at larger ε, with a barrier in between.\n\nFinally, our answers in boxed Latex are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\text{Prompt spontaneous fission occurs if } Z^2 > \\left(\\frac{2\\beta}{\\gamma}\\right) A \\quad \\text{(i.e. roughly when } Z^2/A \\gtrsim 43.3\\text{)};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{For } {}_{94}^{240}\\text{Pu},\\; 94^2 \\approx 8836 < 43.3 \\times 240 \\approx 10400, \\text{ so the nucleus is marginally stable.} \\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{The two sets of states are the rotational bands built on (i) a near‐spherical ground state and (ii) a highly deformed fission isomer.} \\\\\n& \\text{This implies that } V(\\varepsilon) \\text{ has a double‐well shape: one deep minimum near } \\varepsilon=0 \\text{ and a second,} \\\\\n& \\text{shallower minimum at larger } \\varepsilon \\text{ separated by a barrier.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\text{Prompt spontaneous fission occurs if } Z^2 > \\left(\\frac{2\\beta}{\\gamma}\\right) A \\quad \\text{(i.e. roughly when } Z^2/A \\gtrsim 43.3\\text{)};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{For } {}_{94}^{240}\\text{Pu},\\; 94^2 \\approx 8836 < 43.3 \\times 240 \\approx 10400, \\text{ so the nucleus is marginally stable.} \\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{The two sets of states are the rotational bands built on (i) a near‐spherical ground state and (ii) a highly deformed fission isomer.} \\\\\n& \\text{This implies that } V(\\varepsilon) \\text{ has a double‐well shape: one deep minimum near } \\varepsilon=0 \\text{ and a second,} \\\\\n& \\text{shallower minimum at larger } \\varepsilon \\text{ separated by a barrier.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\text{Prompt spontaneous fission occurs if } Z^2 > \\left(\\frac{2\\beta}{\\gamma}\\right) A \\quad \\text{(i.e. roughly when } Z^2/A \\gtrsim 43.3\\text{)};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{For } {}_{94}^{240}\\text{Pu},\\; 94^2 \\approx 8836 < 43.3 \\times 240 \\approx 10400, \\text{ so the nucleus is marginally stable.} \\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{The two sets of states are the rotational bands built on (i) a near‐spherical ground state and (ii) a highly deformed fission isomer.} \\\\\n& \\text{This implies that } V(\\varepsilon) \\text{ has a double‐well shape: one deep minimum near } \\varepsilon=0 \\text{ and a second,} \\\\\n& \\text{shallower minimum at larger } \\varepsilon \\text{ separated by a barrier.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{Z^2}{A} \\geq 43.3"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\text{Prompt spontaneous fission occurs if } Z^2 > \\left(\\frac{2\\beta}{\\gamma}\\right) A \\quad \\text{(i.e. roughly when } Z^2/A \\gtrsim 43.3\\text{)};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{For } {}_{94}^{240}\\text{Pu},\\; 94^2 \\approx 8836 < 43.3 \\times 240 \\approx 10400, \\text{ so the nucleus is marginally stable.} \\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{The two sets of states are the rotational bands built on (i) a near‐spherical ground state and (ii) a highly deformed fission isomer.} \\\\\n& \\text{This implies that } V(\\varepsilon) \\text{ has a double‐well shape: one deep minimum near } \\varepsilon=0 \\text{ and a second,} \\\\\n& \\text{shallower minimum at larger } \\varepsilon \\text{ separated by a barrier.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2J} \\approx 7 \\text{ MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\text{Prompt spontaneous fission occurs if } Z^2 > \\left(\\frac{2\\beta}{\\gamma}\\right) A \\quad \\text{(i.e. roughly when } Z^2/A \\gtrsim 43.3\\text{)};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{For } {}_{94}^{240}\\text{Pu},\\; 94^2 \\approx 8836 < 43.3 \\times 240 \\approx 10400, \\text{ so the nucleus is marginally stable.} \\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{The two sets of states are the rotational bands built on (i) a near‐spherical ground state and (ii) a highly deformed fission isomer.} \\\\\n& \\text{This implies that } V(\\varepsilon) \\text{ has a double‐well shape: one deep minimum near } \\varepsilon=0 \\text{ and a second,} \\\\\n& \\text{shallower minimum at larger } \\varepsilon \\text{ separated by a barrier.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2J} \\approx 3.3 \\text{ MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/1-18", "solution": "We are given several timescales and are asked which is the typical lifetime for an excited atom. Let’s analyze the options step by step:\n\n1. The lifetime of an atomic excited state is determined by the time the atom takes to emit a photon and return to a lower energy state via spontaneous emission.\n2. Experimentally and theoretically, most optical (electronic) transitions in atoms have lifetimes on the order of nanoseconds (10⁻⁹ to 10⁻⁸ seconds). This is the time scale for photon emission processes such as those in alkali atoms.\n3.

The discrete orbits were selected using a quantization condition, and later this condition was given a wave-mechanical (de Broglie) interpretation.\n\nStep 1. (a) Bohr's Postulate\n\nBohr postulated that the angular momentum of the electron in a circular orbit is quantized. That is, the electron in orbit around the nucleus can only have angular momentum given by\n\n  L = mvr = n (h / 2π),\n\nwhere n is a positive integer (the principal quantum number), h is Planck’s constant, and m and v are the electron’s mass and speed, respectively. This quantization of angular momentum was the key assumption that led to the specific allowed orbits and, hence, to the discrete energy levels of the hydrogen atom.\n\nStep 2. (b) The de Broglie Relationship\n\nLouis de Broglie later proposed that any particle with momentum has an associated wavelength given by\n\n  λ = h / p  (with p = m v for non-relativistic speeds).\n\nNow consider an electron in a circular orbit of radius r. A standing wave condition for the electron’s wave must be satisfied if the wave is to be “self-reinforcing” around the closed orbit. This condition is that an integral number of wavelengths must fit exactly into the circumference of the orbit. Mathematically, we require\n\n  2πr = nλ    (n = 1, 2, 3, …).\n\nSubstitute de Broglie’s relation λ = h / (mv) into the above equation:\n\n  2πr = n (h/(mv)).\n\nRearranging gives the familiar quantization of angular momentum:\n\n  mvr = (n h)/(2π).\n\nThus, the requirement that an integral number of de Broglie wavelengths fits exactly into the electron’s orbit implies the Bohr quantization condition for angular momentum. In other words, the Bohr postulate that the electron’s angular momentum is quantized can be derived by considering the wave nature of the electron and insisting that its de Broglie wavelength forms a standing wave along the orbit.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n(a) Bohr postulated that the electron’s orbital angular momentum is quantized, i.e., mvr = n(h/2π).\n\n(b) The de Broglie hypothesis relates the electron's momentum to its wavelength (λ = h/mv).

That is, from (1) and (2) we have\n\n  U_final/U_initial = [2^(1/3)/2].\n\nNumerically, 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26 so\n\n  U_final/U_initial ≈ 1.26/2 = 0.63.\n\nThus the reduction in the Coulomb energy due to fission is\n\n  ΔU_C = U_initial – U_final\n      = U_initial·[1 – U_final/U_initial]\n      = (3/5)·(Z²e²)/(R)·[1 – 2^(–2/3)].\n\nSince 2^(–2/3) ≈ 0.63, we find that roughly 37% of the original Coulomb energy is “lost” (i.e. converted into kinetic or other forms of energy) when the nucleus splits.\n\nRelationship to the Total Energy Change:\n\nIn the liquid drop model the total energy (or binding energy) of the nucleus is obtained from several competing terms. The Coulomb term (which we have calculated) tends to destabilize the nucleus, whereas the surface energy (which is proportional to the surface area) is stabilizing. When a nucleus splits into two fragments the Coulomb energy is reduced (by about 37% in the example above), but at the same time the total surface area increases (since two small spheres have a larger total surface area than one large sphere of the same volume). The extra surface area costs additional energy, so there is an increase in the “surface energy” term.\n\nAlmost all of the reduction in the Coulomb energy is nearly cancelled by the increase in the surface energy. As a result, the net change in energy (which is the energy available as the Q–value of the fission) is much smaller than the reduction in the Coulomb energy by itself. In other words, although the drop in the Coulomb energy is a large number – on the order of (3/5)[Z²e²/R] (which for uranium is almost 1 GeV) – the actual energy released in fission is only a small (sometimes only a few percent) fraction of this value.\n\nFinal Answer in Summary:\n\nWe find that the reduction in electrostatic (Coulomb) energy when a nucleus splits evenly is\n\n  ΔU_C = (3/5)(Z²e²/R) [1 – 2^(–2/3)],\n\nwhich is approximately a 37% reduction compared to the original Coulomb self–energy. However, in the complete liquid drop picture the increase in surface energy almost cancels this Coulomb energy reduction, so that the net change in energy (the Q–value of fission) is much smaller than ΔU_C.\n\nThus, our final answer is\n\n  \\[\\boxed{\\Delta U_C = \\frac{3}{5}\\frac{Z^2e^2}{R}\\left(1-2^{-2/3}\\right), \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Delta U_{tot}\\ll\\Delta U_C.}\\]", "final_answers": ["\\Delta U_C = \\frac{3}{5}\\frac{Z^2e^2}{R}\\left(1-2^{-2/3}\\right), \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Delta U_{tot}\\ll\\Delta U_C."], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\Delta U_C = \\frac{3}{5}\\frac{Z^2e^2}{R}\\left(1-2^{-2/3}\\right), \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Delta U_{tot}\\ll\\Delta U_C.", "expr2": "364 \\ \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "atomic/2-30", "solution": "We can analyze the three parts of the problem step by step.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (a): Energy–Separation Plot and the Liquid‐Drop Model\n\nImagine plotting the total nuclear energy on the vertical axis versus a collective coordinate that represents “elongation” or “separation” on the horizontal axis. At the left, the nucleus is nearly spherical (its ground‐state shape) and resides at a local minimum. As the nucleus is deformed (stretched toward fission), the energy first rises, reaching a maximum (the fission barrier) at a saddle point. Beyond the saddle point, as the nucleus splits into two fragments, the energy drops to a lower level than the original minimum because the resulting fragments have higher binding energy per nucleon. In summary, the energy–separation curve begins at a minimum (ground state), climbs to the fission barrier, then falls off as the system breaks apart.\n\nIn the liquid‐drop model, the nucleus is treated analogously to a charged drop of incompressible fluid. Two competing contributions determine the energy:\n • The surface energy term favors a compact (spherical) shape because increasing the surface area (as in elongation) costs energy.\n • The Coulomb energy term, arising from proton–proton repulsion, favors splitting the nucleus into separate drops since then the repulsive interactions are reduced.\nThus, small deformations increase energy (mainly due to increased surface area) but, once the deformation is pronounced, the reduction in Coulomb repulsion outweighs the cost in surface energy. This competition is reflected in the energy–separation curve: the initial minimum (stable liquid drop) corresponds to surface and Coulomb forces in equilibrium, the hump (fission barrier) arises from the resistance of the surface energy, and the decline beyond the barrier is driven by the release of Coulomb repulsion energy.  \n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (b): Source of the Energy Released in Fission\n\nWhen a heavy nucleus fissions, the binding energy per nucleon of the daughter fragments is typically higher (i.e. they are more tightly bound) than that of the original heavy nucleus. The energy released in fission comes from the mass–energy difference between the initial nucleus and the sum of the fragments. In other words, some of the mass of the nucleus is converted into kinetic energy and other forms (such as gamma rays) according to Einstein’s mass–energy equivalence (E = mc²). This is why fission of heavy elements like uranium releases a considerable amount of energy.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (c): Why Elements Heavier than Iron but Lighter than Lead Do Not Spontaneously Fission\n\nAlthough many nuclei heavier than iron are “less stable” in the sense that fusing lighter elements or fissioning heavier ones can lead to a gain in binding energy per nucleon, a nucleus will not fission spontaneously unless it can overcome the fission barrier described in part (a). For elements heavier than iron but lighter than lead, the fission barrier is relatively high. Therefore, even though the final products might be energetically favorable, the nucleus is prevented from spontaneous fission by a significant energy barrier that requires external energy input (or, in some cases, a very slow quantum tunneling rate). Additionally, the balance between surface tension and Coulomb repulsion is such that these nuclei are “locked in” by the barrier. They do not typically provide the necessary conditions (nearly zero barrier) for spontaneous fission to occur.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The energy-versus-separation plot starts with a minimum at the ground state (compact, spherical shape) and rises to a maximum (the fission barrier due mainly to surface energy) before falling off as the nucleus separates into fragments whose increased binding energy (due to reduced Coulomb repulsion) makes the final state lower in energy. This is in direct analogy with the liquid-drop model where the balance between surface energy (favoring a compact shape) and Coulomb repulsion (favoring separation) determines the shape of the potential energy curve.\n\n(b) The energy released in the fission of heavy elements comes from the difference between the high mass (low binding energy per nucleon) of the original nucleus and the lower mass (higher binding energy per nucleon) of the daughter fragments, with the mass difference being converted into kinetic energy and radiation according to E = mc².\n\n(c) Elements heavier than iron but lighter than lead do not fission spontaneously because they have a significant fission barrier—a result of the competition between the nuclear surface energy and Coulomb repulsion—that prevents the nucleus from deforming and splitting without an external energy input.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer in LaTeX Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) The energy vs. separation plot shows a minimum at the ground state (compact shape), a rise to a maximum (the fission barrier due to surface energy),}\\\\\n\\quad\\text{and then a drop as the system splits into fragments (whose Coulomb repulsion reduction yields higher binding energy).}\\\\[1ex]\n\\text{(b) The energy released comes from the mass defect: the daughter fragments have higher binding energy per nucleon than the initial nucleus,}\\\\\n\\quad\\text{with the mass difference released as kinetic energy and radiation (E = mc²).}\\\\[1ex]\n\\text{(c) Nuclei between iron and lead do not fission spontaneously because the sizable fission barrier, arising from the competition}\\\\\n\\quad\\text{between surface tension and Coulomb repulsion, prevents them from deforming into separated fragments without external energy.}\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) The energy vs. separation plot shows a minimum at the ground state (compact shape), a rise to a maximum (the fission barrier due to surface energy),}\\\\\n\\quad\\text{and then a drop as the system splits into fragments (whose Coulomb repulsion reduction yields higher binding energy).}\\\\[1ex]\n\\text{(b) The energy released comes from the mass defect: the daughter fragments have higher binding energy per nucleon than the initial nucleus,}\\\\\n\\quad\\text{with the mass difference released as kinetic energy and radiation (E = mc²).}\\\\[1ex]\n\\text{(c) Nuclei between iron and lead do not fission spontaneously because the sizable fission barrier, arising from the competition}\\\\\n\\quad\\text{between surface tension and Coulomb repulsion, prevents them from deforming into separated fragments without external energy.}\n\\end{array}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) The energy vs. separation plot shows a minimum at the ground state (compact shape), a rise to a maximum (the fission barrier due to surface energy),}\\\\\n\\quad\\text{and then a drop as the system splits into fragments (whose Coulomb repulsion reduction yields higher binding energy).}\\\\[1ex]\n\\text{(b) The energy released comes from the mass defect: the daughter fragments have higher binding energy per nucleon than the initial nucleus,}\\\\\n\\quad\\text{with the mass difference released as kinetic energy and radiation (E = mc²).}\\\\[1ex]\n\\text{(c) Nuclei between iron and lead do not fission spontaneously because the sizable fission barrier, arising from the competition}\\\\\n\\quad\\text{between surface tension and Coulomb repulsion, prevents them from deforming into separated fragments without external energy.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "\\text{The energy-versus-separation plot shows that as nuclear mass number } A \\text{ increases, binding energy per nucleon } \\varepsilon \\text{ reaches a broad maximum and then decreases.

At a distance R = 2 m = 200 cm the subtended solid angle is\n\n  ΔΩ = (Area)/(R²) = π/(200²) = π/40,000 sr ≃ 7.85×10^(–5) sr.\n\nThen the number of protons scattered into this counter per second is\n\n  N = (Beam rate) × (n t) × (dσ/dΩ evaluated at 30°) × ΔΩ\n   = (10^(12) s^(–1)) × (6.022×10^(20) cm^(–2)) × (1.08×10^(–25) cm²/sr) × (7.85×10^(–5) sr).\n\nNow compute the product step‐by‐step:\n  First, (6.022×10^(20))×(1.08×10^(–25)) ≃ 6.5×10^(–5).\n  Then multiplying by 10^(12) gives 6.5×10^(7).\n  Finally, 6.5×10^(7) × 7.85×10^(–5) ≃ 5.1×10^(3).\n\nThus approximately 5.1×10³ protons per second hit the counter.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (d): Integrated Cross Section for θ > 5°\n\nWe wish to integrate\n  σ(θ > θ_min) = ∫_(θ_min)^(π) [dσ/dΩ] dΩ,\nwith θ_min = 5°.

The wavenumber (inverse wavelength) for a transition from an initial level nᵢ to a final level n_f is\n\n  1/λ = R (1/n_f² – 1/nᵢ²),\n\nwhere R is the appropriate Rydberg constant. In vacuum, the frequency is\n\n  ν = c/λ = cR (1/n_f² – 1/nᵢ²).\n\nIn our case for hydrogen the transition is from n = 109 (initial level) to n = 108 (final level).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Frequency and Wavelength for H\n\nFor hydrogen, we use R_H ≈ 1.09737316×10⁷ m⁻¹ and c ≈ 2.99792458×10⁸ m/s. Then\n\n  ν_H = c R_H [1/108² – 1/109²].\n\nIt is convenient to write the difference in reciprocal squares as follows. Note that\n\n  1/108² – 1/109² = (109² – 108²)/(108²·109²).\n\nBut 109² – 108² factors as\n\n  109² – 108² = (109 + 108)(109 – 108) = 217·1 = 217.\n\nThus\n\n  1/108² – 1/109² = 217/(108²·109²).\n\nA numerical evaluation:\n\n• 108² = 11664  \n• 109² = 11881  \n• Their product: 11664 × 11881 ≈ 1.386×10⁸  \n• Therefore, the difference ≈ 217/(1.386×10⁸) ≈ 1.57×10⁻⁶.\n\nNow, the frequency becomes\n\n  ν_H ≈ (2.9979×10⁸ m/s)×(1.0974×10⁷ m⁻¹)×(1.57×10⁻⁶).\n\nFirst, compute the product cR_H:\n\n  cR_H ≈ 2.9979×10⁸ × 1.0974×10⁷ ≈ 3.292×10¹⁵ s⁻¹.\n\nThen,\n\n  ν_H ≈ 3.292×10¹⁵ × 1.57×10⁻⁶ ≈ 5.17×10⁹ Hz.\n\nThus, the frequency is about 5.17 GHz.\n\nThe wavelength is\n\n  λ_H = c/ν_H ≈ 2.9979×10⁸ m/s / 5.17×10⁹ s⁻¹ ≈ 0.058 m  (or about 5.8 cm).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Ratio of Wavelengths for He and H\n\nFor a one‐electron ion, the Rydberg formula is modified so that the effective Rydberg constant becomes\n\n  R_eff = Z_eff² R_H.\n\nFor a singly ionized helium atom (He II), Z = 2 and there is no screening, so we have\n\n  R_He = 2² R_H = 4 R_H.\n\nThus, for the same transition (from n = 109 to 108) the wavenumbers are\n\n  1/λ_H = R_H (1/108² – 1/109²)   and  1/λ_He = (4 R_H)(1/108² – 1/109²).\n\nThat is,\n\n  1/λ_He = 4/λ_H   ⟹  λ_He = λ_H/4.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the wavelengths is\n\n  (λ_He/λ_H) = 1/4.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Difficulty in Laboratory Observations\n\nObserve that the transition from n = 109 to n = 108 involves very high (Rydberg) states. There are several reasons why such a transition is hard to observe in the lab:\n\n1. The energy difference between levels with n ≃ 100 is extremely small. (In our example the photon energy hν corresponds to only a few GHz in frequency – roughly a few micro–electron volts.)\n\n2. High–n (Rydberg) states are very weakly bound. They are extremely sensitive to stray electric and magnetic fields and collisions. Under typical laboratory conditions collisions and perturbations will rapidly quench these states or ionize the atoms before the transition can be observed.\n\n3. In the laboratory it is very difficult to produce a significant population of atoms in these highly excited states. In astrophysical plasmas the low densities and long time scales allow such states to exist and radiate, but in the lab the collisional environment and background radiation make it very hard to both populate and detect these transitions.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The frequency of the H transition is approximately 5.17×10⁹ Hz, corresponding to a wavelength of about 5.8 cm.\n\n(b) For helium, the effective Rydberg constant is 4 times larger, so the wavelength is 1/4 that for hydrogen; that is, (λ_He)/(λ_H) = 1/4.\n\n(c) Such transitions involve extremely high (Rydberg) states with very small energy separations.

{"id": "atomic/1-44", "solution": "We wish to compare the “Rydberg‐like” energy level diagrams of atomic lithium and atomic hydrogen for the principal quantum numbers n = 2, 3, 4. Although hydrogen (to first order) has levels given exactly by\n\n  Eₙ(H) = – 13.6 eV/n²\n\n(with n = 2, 3, 4 corresponding roughly to –3.4 eV, –1.51 eV, and –0.85 eV respectively), the situation in lithium is more complicated because the valence (outer) electron “sees” a nucleus of Z = 3, but with strong screening by the two 1s electrons. Moreover, the levels are not exactly degenerate in l due to the so‐called quantum defects. (In hydrogen all states with a given n are degenerate when fine structure is neglected.) In Li one finds:\n\n1. The ground state (which for Li is 1s² 2s) lies in the “n = 2” manifold. However, due to the quantum defect for s states the 2s level is pushed to lower energy (i.e. it is more strongly bound) than the corresponding 2p level.\n  • Rough numbers (that reproduce the observed ionization energy of Li ≈ 5.39 eV) are obtained by writing the Rydberg formula in the form\n    E = – R_eff/(n – δ)²\n  For Li:\n   – 2s: δ ≈ 0.40 → E(2s) ≈ –13.6/(2 – 0.40)² = –13.6/(1.6²) ≈ –5.39 eV (by construction),\n   – 2p: δ ≈ 0.04 → E(2p) ≈ –13.6/(2 – 0.04)² ≈ –13.6/(1.96²) ≈ –3.6 eV.\nSo in the “n = 2” manifold for Li the 2s level lies lower (more bound) than the 2p level.\n\n2. For n = 3 and n = 4 the quantum defects are much smaller (and nearly vanish for l > 0). Thus the states 3s, 3p, (and even 3d) are nearly degenerate. Their energies come out around –1.55 eV (for n = 3) and similarly for n = 4 (~ –0.85 eV) (the numbers being quite similar to the hydrogen values for n = 3, 4).\n\n3. In contrast, hydrogen has\n  • n = 2 level at E ≈ –3.4 eV,\n  • n = 3 level at E ≈ –1.51 eV,\n  • n = 4 level at E ≈ –0.85 eV,\nand all states with a given n are essentially degenerate (neglecting fine structure).\n\nA STEP‐BY‐STEP SKETCH DESCRIPTION\n\na) Draw a vertical energy axis with zero at the top (ionization limit) so that energy becomes more negative downward.\n\nb) Plot the hydrogen levels as follows:\n  – A horizontal line for n = 2 at about –3.4 eV,\n  – A line for n = 3 at about –1.51 eV,\n  – A line for n = 4 at about –0.85 eV.\nLabel them “H (n = 2)”, “H (n = 3)”, and “H (n = 4)”.\n\nc) Now, plot the Li levels. For Li the “n = 2” manifold consists of:\n  – A 2s level at ~ –5.39 eV (this is the ground state of Li),\n  – A 2p level at ~ –3.6 eV.\nThus, on the diagram the 2s state is lower (i.e. further down) than the 2p state. Notice that the Li 2p level nearly coincides with the hydrogen n = 2 level.\n  – Next, the n = 3 manifold in Li comprises the 3s, 3p, and 3d levels which (because the quantum defects are small for l > 0) all lie roughly at –1.55 eV (nearly degenerate with the hydrogen n = 3 level).\n  – Similarly, the n = 4 manifold in Li (4s, 4p, etc.) is around –0.85 eV, nearly overlapping the hydrogen n = 4 level.\n\nd) Indicate Transitions:\n  • For emission:\n   – In Li, one may have downward transitions such as 2p → 2s. (This is the strong resonance doublet seen in absorption if exciting the ground state, but it will also appear as an emission line if the atom is excited.) Also, transitions from n = 3 → n = 2 (e.g., 3p → 2s or 3p → 2p) and from n = 4 → n = 2 (or → n = 3) might appear.\n   – In hydrogen, the Balmer series involves transitions such as n = 3 → 2, n = 4 → 2, etc. For example, the famous Hα line corresponds to the 3 → 2 transition.\n  • For absorption:\n   – In Li, the most important (and experimentally studied) absorption is from the ground state 2s to the 2p level (the resonance line); also, absorption from 2s to higher n (e.g., 3p or 4p) may appear.\n   – In hydrogen, absorption transitions from n = 1 (if one were including the Lyman series) or—for an atom already in the n = 2 level in an excited environment—absorption of a 2 → 3 or 2 → 4 photon may occur.\n\ne) In your diagram, you may draw upward arrows (or note “absorption”) for transitions going from the lower level to an upper level (for example, from the Li 2s → 2p transition) and downward arrows (“emission”) for transitions going from a higher level down to a lower level (for example, the hydrogen 3 → 2 or Li 3p → 2s lines).\n\nFINAL REMARKS\n\nThe diagram therefore shows that while the hydrogen n = 2, 3, and 4 levels are “evenly spaced” on a 1/n² scale, the Li levels are “perturbed” by electron correlations and quantum defects. In Li the 2s state is especially deep (the ground state at –5.39 eV), and the 2p state is pushed upward (to about –3.6 eV) so that it nearly coincides with the hydrogen n = 2 level. The higher “n” manifolds in Li are nearly hydrogenic, so that n = 3 and 4 states in Li lie at almost the same energies as the corresponding hydrogen levels (~ –1.55 eV and –0.85 eV, respectively). On the diagram, by drawing arrows between the levels you can indicate possible emission lines (e.g., downward arrows such as 2p → 2s, 3p → 2s, 4p → 2s, and hydrogen 3 → 2) and possible absorption lines (e.g., upward arrows from Li 2s → 2p, 2s → 3p and hydrogen 2 → 3, 2 → 4).\n\nThus, the key point is that because of quantum defect effects the Li 2s state is anomalously low and the Li 2p state lies close to the hydrogen n = 2 level, whereas for n = 3 and 4 the Li levels are nearly hydrogen-like.\n\nThe final answer is summarized as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{For hydrogen:} \\\\\n\\quad E(n=2)\\approx -3.4\\,\\text{eV},\\quad E(n=3)\\approx -1.51\\,\\text{eV},\\quad E(n=4)\\approx -0.85\\,\\text{eV}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{For lithium (valence-electron levels):} \\\\\n\\quad \\text{2s (ground state)}\\approx -5.39\\,\\text{eV},\\quad \\text{2p}\\approx -3.6\\,\\text{eV},\\\\[0.5mm]\n\\quad \\text{n=3 (3s, 3p, 3d) } \\approx -1.55\\,\\text{eV},\\quad \\text{n=4 } \\approx -0.85\\,\\text{eV}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Thus, in the sketch:} \\\\\n\\quad \\text{(1) Li 2s lies well below Li 2p, with Li 2p almost coinciding with H n=2.}\\\\[0.5mm]\n\\quad \\text{(2) Li n=3 and n=4 levels are nearly degenerate and nearly aligned with the corresponding hydrogen levels.}\\\\[0.5mm]\n\\quad \\text{Emission lines (downward arrows), e.g., Li: 2p} \\to \\text{2s, 3p} \\to \\text{2s, H: 3} \\to \\text{2};}\\\\[0.5mm]\n\\quad \\text{Absorption lines (upward arrows), e.g., Li: 2s} \\to \\text{2p, 3p and H: 2} \\to \\text{3, 4.}\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]\n\nThis is the desired energy level diagram and the identification of several typical absorption and emission transitions for atomic lithium (with n=2,3,4) and for atomic hydrogen (with n=2,3,4).", "final_answers": ["\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{For hydrogen:} \\\\\n\\quad E(n=2)\\approx -3.4\\,\\text{eV},\\quad E(n=3)\\approx -1.51\\,\\text{eV},\\quad E(n=4)\\approx -0.85\\,\\text{eV}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{For lithium (valence-electron levels):} \\\\\n\\quad \\text{2s (ground state)}\\approx -5.39\\,\\text{eV},\\quad \\text{2p}\\approx -3.6\\,\\text{eV},\\\\[0.5mm]\n\\quad \\text{n=3 (3s, 3p, 3d) } \\approx -1.55\\,\\text{eV},\\quad \\text{n=4 } \\approx -0.85\\,\\text{eV}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Thus, in the sketch:} \\\\\n\\quad \\text{(1) Li 2s lies well below Li 2p, with Li 2p almost coinciding with H n=2.}\\\\[0.5mm]\n\\quad \\text{(2) Li n=3 and n=4 levels are nearly degenerate and nearly aligned with the corresponding hydrogen levels.}\\\\[0.5mm]\n\\quad \\text{Emission lines (downward arrows), e.g., Li: 2p} \\to \\text{2s, 3p} \\to \\text{2s, H: 3} \\to \\text{2};"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{For hydrogen:} \\\\\n\\quad E(n=2)\\approx -3.4\\,\\text{eV},\\quad E(n=3)\\approx -1.51\\,\\text{eV},\\quad E(n=4)\\approx -0.85\\,\\text{eV}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{For lithium (valence-electron levels):} \\\\\n\\quad \\text{2s (ground state)}\\approx -5.39\\,\\text{eV},\\quad \\text{2p}\\approx -3.6\\,\\text{eV},\\\\[0.5mm]\n\\quad \\text{n=3 (3s, 3p, 3d) } \\approx -1.55\\,\\text{eV},\\quad \\text{n=4 } \\approx -0.85\\,\\text{eV}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Thus, in the sketch:} \\\\\n\\quad \\text{(1) Li 2s lies well below Li 2p, with Li 2p almost coinciding with H n=2.}\\\\[0.5mm]\n\\quad \\text{(2) Li n=3 and n=4 levels are nearly degenerate and nearly aligned with the corresponding hydrogen levels.}\\\\[0.5mm]\n\\quad \\text{Emission lines (downward arrows), e.g., Li: 2p} \\to \\text{2s, 3p} \\to \\text{2s, H: 3} \\to \\text{2};", "expr2": "\\text{Absorption: } 2s \\rightarrow np \\ (n = 2, 3, 4)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

(a) All the particle trajectories must lie in the same plane in the center of mass frame.\n\nIn any two-body collision, momentum conservation implies that the total momentum is zero in the center of mass (CM) frame. Hence, the momenta of the two particles are opposite to each other. When a collision occurs, the directions of the outgoing momenta must conserve the overall momentum, and with only one independent scattering angle, the incident and scattered momenta lie in one plane (called the scattering plane). Therefore, (a) is True.\n\nStep 2. (b) The helicity of a participant cannot change.\n\nHelicity is defined as the projection of a particle’s spin onto its momentum direction. For massless particles, helicity is Lorentz invariant and is often conserved in many interactions. However, for massive particles helicity can change; what truly matters in many collisions are the conservation of total angular momentum and parity (where applicable), not the individual helicities in a Lorentz-boosted scenario. In an elastic collision involving massive particles or in a general situation, there is no general conservation law for an individual particle’s helicity. Therefore, statement (b) is False.\n\nStep 3. (c) The angular distribution is always spherically symmetric.\n\nIn the CM frame for a two-body collision, while there exists an inherent symmetry, the initial momenta define a particular direction. As a consequence, the scattering amplitude generally depends on the scattering angle (often characterized by a polar angle relative to the incident direction) and may show anisotropy. Only in very special circumstances (for example, if the potential is completely central and the interaction is independent of spin or other preferred directions) will the distribution be spherically symmetric. In general, one cannot claim spherical symmetry of the angular distribution.

{"id": "atomic/4-29", "solution": "We wish to study the reaction\n\n  γ + p → K⁺ + Λ⁰\n\nwith a proton target. We shall first work with a free “laboratory‐proton” and then consider the effect of Fermi motion. Finally we study the decay Λ⁰ → p + π⁻ when the Λ⁰ is moving (v = 0.8c). In what follows we use natural units (c = 1) and masses in units of MeV.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (a): Threshold Photon Energy in the Laboratory\n\nWhen the proton is at rest the threshold condition is reached when the final particles (K⁺ and Λ⁰) are produced with no relative motion in the overall center–of–mass. In that situation the invariant mass squared of the final state is\n\n  s_th = (m_K + m_Λ)².\n\nOn the other hand the initial 4–momentum is given by the photon and the proton at rest. For a photon of energy E_γ (and momentum E_γ) and a proton of mass m_p we have\n\n  s = (E_γ + m_p)² – (E_γ)² \n    = m_p² + 2 m_p E_γ.\n\nSetting s = s_th yields\n\n  m_p² + 2 m_p E_γ = (m_K + m_Λ)²   ⇒  \n  E_γ = [(m_K + m_Λ)² – m_p²]⁄(2 m_p).\n\nUsing the provided masses (m_K ≡ 494 MeV, m_Λ ≡ 1116 MeV, and taking the proton mass m_p ≃ 938 MeV), we compute:\n\n  m_K + m_Λ = 494 + 1116 = 1610 MeV,\n  (m_K + m_Λ)² = (1610)² = 2.5921×10⁶ MeV²,\n  m_p² ≃ (938)² ≃ 880,144 MeV².\n\nThus\n\n  E_γ = (2.5921×10⁶ – 880144)/(2×938)\n    = (1.711956×10⁶) / 1876 ≃ 912 MeV.\n\nSo the minimum photon energy (lab frame) is about 912 MeV.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (b): Effect of Fermi Motion\n\nWhen the proton is bound inside a nucleus it is not at rest. A “typical” Fermi momentum has a magnitude p_F ~ 250 MeV/c. The easiest way to see the effect is to note that if the initial proton happens to be moving opposite to the incoming photon (i.e. “head‐on”) then its energy is slightly increased by its motion and, more importantly, the total momentum in the lab is reduced so that the threshold condition can be met with a lower E_γ.\n\nLet the proton have 3–momentum p (|p| = 250 MeV/c) opposite to the photon direction. Then the proton’s energy is\n\n  E_p = √(m_p² + p²) ≃ √(938² + 250²) ≃ 971 MeV.\n\nNow, with the photon (energy E_γ, momentum E_γ in the +z direction) and the proton (energy 971 MeV, momentum 250 MeV in the –z direction), the total energy is\n\n  E_tot = E_γ + 971 MeV,\nand the total momentum is\n  p_tot = E_γ – 250 MeV.\n\nThus the invariant mass squared is\n\n  s = (E_γ + 971)² – (E_γ – 250)².\n\nLet’s expand:\n  (E_γ + 971)² = E_γ² + 2·971 E_γ + 971²,\n  (E_γ – 250)² = E_γ² – 2·250 E_γ + 250².\nSubtracting,\n  s = [E_γ² + 2·971 E_γ + 971²] – [E_γ² – 500 E_γ + 62,500] \n    = (1942 + 500)E_γ + (971² – 62,500)\n    = 2442 E_γ + (942841 – 62500)\n    = 2442 E_γ + 880341.\n\nSetting the threshold condition, s = (m_K + m_Λ)² = 2.5921×10⁶ MeV², we have\n\n  2442 E_γ + 880341 = 2.5921×10⁶,\nor\n  E_γ = (2.5921×10⁶ – 880341) / 2442.\n\nEvaluating the numerator:\n  2.5921×10⁶ – 880341 ≃ 1.71176×10⁶,\nso\n  E_γ ≃ 1.71176×10⁶ / 2442 ≃ 700 MeV.\n\nThus, with a Fermi momentum of about 250 MeV/c (optimally directed), the threshold photon energy can drop to roughly 700 MeV.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (c): Kinematics of Λ⁰ → p + π⁻ Decay\n\nGiven that the Λ⁰ decays (in its rest frame) into a proton and a π⁻ it is useful to first compute the momentum of the π⁻ in the Λ rest frame. We use the standard two–body decay formula:\n\n  p* = (1/(2 m_Λ)) √[ (m_Λ² – (m_p + m_π)²)(m_Λ² – (m_p – m_π)²) ].\n\nHere we take m_p ≃ 938 MeV and m_π ≃ 140 MeV; m_Λ = 1116 MeV. Compute:\n  m_p + m_π = 938 + 140 = 1078 MeV,\n  m_p – m_π = 938 – 140 = 798 MeV.\nThus,\n  m_Λ² = 1116² = 1,245,456 MeV²,\n  (m_p + m_π)² = 1078² = 1,162,084 MeV²,\n  (m_p – m_π)² = 798² = 636,804 MeV².\nThen\n  m_Λ² – (m_p + m_π)² = 1,245,456 – 1,162,084 = 83,372 MeV²,\n  m_Λ² – (m_p – m_π)² = 1,245,456 – 636,804 = 608,652 MeV².\nSo the product is\n  83,372×608,652 ≃ 5.0745×10¹⁰ MeV⁴.\nTaking the square root:\n  √(5.0745×10¹⁰) ≃ 225,214 MeV².\nThus,\n  p* = 225214 / (2×1116) = 225214 / 2232 ≃ 101 MeV/c.\n\nThat is, in the Λ rest frame the π⁻ has momentum p* ~ 101 MeV/c (and energy E* = √(p*² + m_π²) ≃ √(101² + 140²) ≃ √(10201 + 19600) ≃ √29801 ≃ 172.6 MeV).\n\nNow suppose the Λ itself is moving in the laboratory with velocity v = 0.8c. Its Lorentz factor is\n\n  γ = 1/√(1 – 0.8²) = 1/√(0.36) ≃ 1.667,\nand β = 0.8.\n\n(i) Maximum laboratory momentum for the π⁻\n\nThe maximum pion momentum in the laboratory is obtained when, in the Λ rest frame, the pion is emitted in the same direction as the Λ’s motion. Under a Lorentz boost (in the z–direction) the longitudinal momentum transforms as\n\n  pₗₐb = γ (p* cosθ* + β E*).\n\nFor maximum momentum choose cosθ* = 1. Then\n\n  pₗₐb^max = γ (p* + β E*) = 1.667 (101 MeV + 0.8×172.6 MeV).\n\nSince 0.8×172.6 ≃ 138.1 MeV, we have\n\n  pₗₐb^max ≃ 1.667 (101 + 138.1) ≃ 1.667×239.1 ≃ 398.5 MeV/c.\n\nThus the maximum momentum that the π⁻ can have in the laboratory is approximately 400 MeV/c.\n\n(ii) Maximum transverse (perpendicular) momentum\n\nUnder a Lorentz boost the components perpendicular to the boost direction are not changed. In the Λ rest frame the maximum transverse momentum is obtained when the pion is emitted at 90° to the boost direction. In that case, p* is entirely transverse; that is,\n\n  p_⊥^lab = p* ≃ 101 MeV/c.\n\nThus the maximum component of the laboratory momentum of the π⁻ perpendicular to the Λ direction is about 101 MeV/c.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The threshold photon energy for γ + p → K⁺ + Λ⁰ (with p at rest) is approximately 912 MeV.\n\n(b) With a Fermi momentum of about 250 MeV/c (proton moving opposite to the photon) the required photon energy drops to approximately 700 MeV.\n\n(c) For the decay Λ⁰ → p + π⁻ with Λ⁰ having v = 0.8c:\n  (i) the maximum π⁻ momentum in the laboratory is about 400 MeV/c,\n  (ii) and the maximum transverse (perpendicular) lab momentum is about 100 MeV/c.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer in Latex Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &E_\\gamma^\\text{th} \\simeq 912\\;\\text{MeV},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &E_\\gamma^\\text{th}(\\text{Fermi}) \\simeq 700\\;\\text{MeV},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &p_{\\pi^-}^{\\max} \\simeq 400\\;\\text{MeV}/c,\\quad\np_{\\pi^-,\\perp}^{\\max} \\simeq 100\\;\\text{MeV}/c.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &E_\\gamma^\\text{th} \\simeq 912\\;\\text{MeV},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &E_\\gamma^\\text{th}(\\text{Fermi}) \\simeq 700\\;\\text{MeV},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &p_{\\pi^-}^{\\max} \\simeq 400\\;\\text{MeV}/c,\\quad\np_{\\pi^-,\\perp}^{\\max} \\simeq 100\\;\\text{MeV}/c.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &E_\\gamma^\\text{th} \\simeq 912\\;\\text{MeV},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &E_\\gamma^\\text{th}(\\text{Fermi}) \\simeq 700\\;\\text{MeV},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &p_{\\pi^-}^{\\max} \\simeq 400\\;\\text{MeV}/c,\\quad\np_{\\pi^-,\\perp}^{\\max} \\simeq 100\\;\\text{MeV}/c.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "913 \\ \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &E_\\gamma^\\text{th} \\simeq 912\\;\\text{MeV},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &E_\\gamma^\\text{th}(\\text{Fermi}) \\simeq 700\\;\\text{MeV},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &p_{\\pi^-}^{\\max} \\simeq 400\\;\\text{MeV}/c,\\quad\np_{\\pi^-,\\perp}^{\\max} \\simeq 100\\;\\text{MeV}/c.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "739 \\ \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &E_\\gamma^\\text{th} \\simeq 912\\;\\text{MeV},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &E_\\gamma^\\text{th}(\\text{Fermi}) \\simeq 700\\;\\text{MeV},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &p_{\\pi^-}^{\\max} \\simeq 400\\;\\text{MeV}/c,\\quad\np_{\\pi^-,\\perp}^{\\max} \\simeq 100\\;\\text{MeV}/c.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "399 \\, \\text{MeV/c}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "atomic/3-6", "solution": "We must decide, for each conserved quantity, in which kinds of particle interactions (strong, electromagnetic, and/or weak) the conservation law has never been seen to fail. Then, for one of these symmetries for which violation is known, we must give an example experiment that established the violation.\n\nLet’s examine them one by one:\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. (a) Isospin (I‐spin) Conservation\n\nIsospin is an approximate symmetry of the strong interaction. In the strong interaction the isospin quantum number is very nearly (and to a very good approximation exactly) conserved. However, electromagnetic effects (because the photon couples to electric charge, thereby “feeling” the difference between, say, protons and neutrons) and the weak interaction do not obey isospin invariance. Therefore:\n\n• Observed “no‐violation” only in the Strong interactions (S).\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. (b) I₃ (the third component of isospin) Conservation\n\nThe third component of isospin, I₃, is essentially fixed by (electric) charge conservation. Charge is conserved by all three interactions:\n • In the strong interaction, I₃ is conserved.\n • In the electromagnetic interaction, I₃ is also conserved.\n • And in the weak interaction, while many other quantum numbers are not conserved, electric charge (and therefore I₃) is absolutely conserved.\nThus, I₃ conservation is observed in all three: Strong (S), Electromagnetic (E), and Weak (W).\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 3. (c) Strangeness Conservation\n\nThe “strangeness” quantum number is conserved in the strong and electromagnetic interactions. However, it is not conserved in weak decays (which is why, for example, strange particles like kaons have relatively long lifetimes—their decays can only proceed via the weak interaction in which strangeness is violated). Hence:\n\n• No violation in Strong (S) and Electromagnetic (E),\n• but strangeness is violated in the Weak (W) interaction.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 4. (d) CP Invariance\n\nFor most purposes the strong and electromagnetic interactions respect CP symmetry. (There is the interesting “strong CP problem” in QCD, but experimentally CP violation in QCD effects is, if present, extremely small.) Conversely, the weak interaction is well known to violate CP symmetry. A famous experiment that established this violation is the one by Cronin and Fitch in 1964, which observed that the long‐lived neutral K meson (K⁰_L) decays partly into two pions (π⁺π⁻), a CP‐forbidden final state if CP were an exact symmetry. Thus:\n\n• CP is conserved in the Strong (S) and Electromagnetic (E) interactions,\n• but violated in the Weak (W) interaction.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 5. An Example of an Experiment Showing a Violation\n\nWe choose CP invariance as a representative case. The Cronin–Fitch experiment (1964) on neutral K meson decays provided clear evidence that CP symmetry is not an exact symmetry of nature.

{"id": "atomic/4-18", "solution": "We must first decide what reaction we are considering. Because strong‐interaction processes conserve strangeness, one cannot “produce” a K⁻ by itself. In fact, if a pion beam hits a proton target and one observes a K⁻ in the final state, another strange particle must also be produced so that the net strangeness remains zero.\n\nA common choice in the literature is to consider the reaction\n\n  π⁻ + p → K⁻ + K⁺ + n\n\nHere the initial state has zero strangeness, and in the final state the K⁻ has S = –1 while the K⁺ has S = +1 (and the neutron has S = 0), so strangeness is conserved.\n\nLet us denote the masses by\n\n  m_π ≈ 139.6 MeV, m_p ≈ 938.3 MeV,\n  m_K ≈ 493.7 MeV  (for both K⁻ and K⁺),\n  m_n ≈ 939.6 MeV.\n\nAt threshold (in the center‐of‐mass frame) the final particles are produced at rest relative to one another so that the total center‐of‐mass energy (which we denote by W) is just the sum of their masses.

At threshold we require\n\n  s_thr = (W_thr)² = [m_n + 2m_K]².\n\nThus, one may solve for the threshold pion energy E_π^(thr) by writing\n\n  2 m_p E_π^(thr) = (m_n + 2m_K)² – m_p² – m_π²\n\nso that\n\n  E_π^(thr) = { (m_n + 2m_K)² – m_p² – m_π² } / (2 m_p).\n\nLet us substitute the numbers. First, calculate (m_n + 2m_K):\n\n  m_n + 2m_K ≈ 939.6 + 2×493.7 ≈ 939.6 + 987.4 = 1927.0 MeV.\n\nThen\n\n  (m_n + 2m_K)² ≈ (1927.0 MeV)² ≈ 3.712×10⁶ MeV².\n\nNow, m_p² ≈ (938.3)² ≈ 880,350 MeV² and m_π² ≈ (139.6)² ≈ 19,500 MeV² (approximately).

{"id": "atomic/3-1", "solution": "We “rank” the interactions by their strength by looking at how strongly they couple to matter. In other words, the “strength” is measured by the size of the relevant (dimensionless) coupling constant or, more generally, by the probability amplitude calculated from the interaction’s terms in the Lagrangian. Let’s go step by step.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (a): What is “strength”?\n\n1. Coupling constant:\n • In quantum field theory, each force comes with an associated coupling constant which appears in its Lagrangian. For example, for electromagnetism the coupling is the electric charge e (or equivalently the fine–structure constant α ≡ e²/4πħc ≅ 1/137), while for the strong interaction the analogous number is the strong coupling constant (αs), which at typical hadronic energy scales (around 1 GeV) is on the order of unity.\n • For the weak interaction, one often uses the Fermi coupling constant GF ≈ 1.166×10⁻⁵ GeV⁻². (This is not dimensionless but indicates the intrinsic “weakness” of the force when compared on the same energy scale.)  \n • Gravity is extremely feeble at the particle scale; when appropriately “made dimensionless” the gravitational coupling between, say, two protons is typically O(10⁻³⁸) compared to the electromagnetic repulsion.\n\n2. Observable consequences:\n • The larger the coupling, the higher the probability (or cross-section) for processes mediated by that force. For example, strong interaction cross-sections are large compared to those of a single photon exchange.\n • In scattering experiments or decays, one “sees” the relative strengths by comparing reaction rates. (Strong reactions happen very rapidly and produce abundant particles, electromagnetic reactions are slower, and weak decays are “slow” compared to the lifetime scales set by the strong and electromagnetic interactions.)\n\nThus “strength” is a quantitative measure of the typical interaction amplitude or cross-section as determined by the magnitude of the coupling constant (and related factors such as energy scale and the number of exchanged quanta) in the underlying quantum field theory.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (b): Conservation Laws\n\nIt turns out that each of the three non–gravitational forces “selects” the quantum numbers that it automatically conserves. Experimental facts – such as the types of decays observed – then tell us which symmetries each interaction respects.\n\n1. Strong Interaction:\n • Conserved quantum numbers in strong processes include:\n  – Baryon number and electric charge.\n  – “Flavour” quantum numbers such as strangeness, charm, etc. (Since the gluon, the mediator of the strong force, carries no flavor, it does not change quark flavor.)\n  – Color charge is exactly conserved as it is the “charge” of QCD.\n  – Parity (P) is conserved in strong interactions.\n • Experimental justification:\n  – For instance, strange particles (those with nonzero strangeness) are always produced in pairs in strong interactions. A single hadron carrying strangeness does not appear unless there is a compensating partner. This “selection rule” was historically one of the keys to understanding that strangeness is conserved by the strong force.\n\n2. Electromagnetic Interaction:\n • Conserved quantities in electromagnetic processes include:\n  – Electric charge (by gauge invariance under U(1) transformations).\n  – Baryon and lepton numbers.\n  – Angular momentum and (in most cases) parity are also conserved.\n  – In addition, electromagnetic transitions do not change particle flavor.\n • Experimental justification:\n  – Photon–induced transitions obey strict conservation of electric charge and parity. Processes such as atomic radiative transitions follow selection rules dictated by electromagnetic gauge invariance.\n  – No electromagnetic process has been observed which violates these symmetries.\n\n3. Weak Interaction:\n • The weak force is unusual when compared with the strong and electromagnetic interactions:\n  – It conserves electric charge, baryon number, and total lepton number.\n  – It violates parity (P) maximally – an experimental fact famously demonstrated by the Wu experiment in the 1950s.\n  – It also violates charge conjugation (C) symmetry and, in some processes, even the combined CP symmetry (CP violation observed in decays of K and B mesons).\n  – It does not conserve flavor quantum numbers such as strangeness, meaning that weak interactions can change one type of quark into another.\n • Experimental justification:\n  – The nonconservation of strangeness in processes like the decay of the K meson clearly shows that flavor is not respected by the weak force.\n  – Moreover, the Wu experiment showed that electrons were preferentially emitted in one direction in the beta decay of polarized cobalt nuclei, a clear sign of parity violation.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer\n\n(a) “Strength” refers to the magnitude of the coupling constant (or effective coupling) appearing in the interaction Lagrangian, which quantitatively determines the probability amplitude (and hence cross–section, decay rate, etc.) for processes mediated by that force. Strong interactions are “strong” because their coupling (αs) is O(1) at hadronic scales, electromagnetic interactions are weaker (α ≈ 1/137), and weak interactions are even “weaker” (characterized by GF ≈ 10⁻⁵ GeV⁻²), with gravity being negligibly small in particle physics experiments.\n\n(b) The conservation laws followed by the different interactions are as follows:\n • Strong: Conserves baryon number, electric charge, color, and flavor quantum numbers (such as strangeness, charm, etc.) as well as parity. This is evidenced, for instance, by the fact that strange hadrons are produced in pairs in strong processes.\n • Electromagnetic: Conserves electric charge, baryon and lepton number, angular momentum, and parity. Electromagnetic transitions obey strict charge and parity conservation, in accord with the observed selection rules.\n • Weak: Conserves electric charge and overall baryon and lepton number but does not conserve flavor (allowing, for example, strangeness-changing decays) and violates parity and C symmetry (and even CP in certain decays). Experimental observations such as the beta decay asymmetry in the Wu experiment and the nonconservation of strangeness in kaon decays confirm these characteristics.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer in Latex\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\text{“Strength” is quantified by the size of the coupling constant (or effective coupling) in the interaction Lagrangian,}\\\\\n&\\text{which determines the probability (via cross–sections, decay rates, etc.) for the force to act.}\\\\\n&\\text{For example, the strong force has } \\alpha_s \\sim \\mathcal{O}(1),\\ \\text{electromagnetism has } \\alpha\\approx\\frac{1}{137},\\text{ and the weak force is}\\\\\n&\\text{characterized by } G_F\\approx1.166\\times10^{-5}\\, \\text{GeV}^{-2}\\text{.

{"id": "atomic/3-30", "solution": "We begin with the process\n\n  π⁻ + d → n + n.\n\nStep 1. Identifying the intrinsic properties\n\n• The π⁻ has spin 0 and intrinsic parity (η_π) of –1.\n• The deuteron has spin 1 and intrinsic parity +1.\n• The π⁻ is captured from a p orbital, meaning its orbital angular momentum with respect to the deuteron is L_i = 1. The extra orbital factor contributes a parity of (–1)^(L_i) = (–1)¹ = –1.\n\nStep 2. Constructing the initial state\n\nThe overall parity of the initial state is given by the product of the intrinsic parities and the orbital parity. Thus,\n  P_initial = π⁻ intrinsic parity × deuteron parity × (–1)^(L_i)\n       = (–1) × (+1) × (–1)\n       = +1.\n\nAlso, the initial angular momentum is found by coupling the deuteron’s spin (S_d = 1) with the pion’s orbital angular momentum L_i = 1. The possible total angular momenta are J = 0, 1, or 2. For our discussion, note that one of these channels (J=0) is available; the final state will have total angular momentum zero, as we soon see.\n\nStep 3. Analyzing the final state\n\nThe two neutrons produced have the following features:\n• Each neutron has intrinsic parity +1.\n• The relative orbital angular momentum L_f between the two neutrons contributes a parity factor (–1)^(L_f).\n\nThus the overall parity of the final state is\n  P_final = (+1 × +1) × (–1)^(L_f) = (–1)^(L_f).\n\nParity conservation requires that P_final = P_initial. We already have P_initial = +1; therefore,\n  (–1)^(L_f) = +1,\nwhich implies that L_f must be even (L_f = 0, 2, …). The lowest possibility is L_f = 0.\n\nStep 4. Angular momentum and symmetry restrictions\n\nLet us now consider the spin state of the two neutrons. When L_f = 0, the spatial part of the two-neutron wave function is symmetric. However, neutrons are fermions, and the overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric under the exchange of the two neutrons.\n\nThe overall wavefunction is the product of the spatial, spin, and isospin parts. For two neutrons:\n• The spatial wavefunction is symmetric (for L_f = 0 or any even L).\n• The isospin state for two identical neutrons is necessarily symmetric (they both have the same isospin projection, so they can only form the T = 1 triplet state).\n• Therefore, to achieve an overall antisymmetric state, the spin part must be antisymmetric. For two spin-½ particles, the antisymmetric spin state is the singlet state (S = 0).\n\nStep 5. Final Matching of Quantum Numbers\n\nIn the final state, with L_f = 0 and S = 0, the total angular momentum is\n  J_final = L_f + S = 0 + 0 = 0,\nwhich matches one of the initial J possibilities. Moreover, parity is conserved:\n  P_final = (–1)^(0) = +1,\nagreeing with P_initial.\n\nThus, the only way to satisfy angular momentum conservation, parity conservation, and the overall antisymmetry of the wavefunction (given that the isospin state is symmetric) is that the two neutrons emerge in the spin-singlet (S = 0) state.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The two neutrons must be in the } ^1S_0 \\text{ state (spin singlet) to satisfy parity, angular momentum, and the antisymmetry of the total wavefunction.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{The two neutrons must be in the } ^1S_0 \\text{ state (spin singlet) to satisfy parity, angular momentum, and the antisymmetry of the total wavefunction.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{The two neutrons must be in the } ^1S_0 \\text{ state (spin singlet) to satisfy parity, angular momentum, and the antisymmetry of the total wavefunction.}", "expr2": "\\text{The two neutrons must be in a singlet spin state.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

In the center–of–mass (CM) frame the total energy is\n\n  √s = Eₑ⁺ + Eₑ⁻.\n\nFor a symmetric machine we can take\n\n  Eₑ⁺ = Eₑ⁻ = E_beam.\n\nTo produce an on–shell Z⁰ we require\n\n  √s = M_Z.\n\nThus,\n  2 E_beam = M_Z ⟹ E_beam = M_Z/2.\n\nNumerically,\n  E_beam = 92 GeV/2 = 46 GeV.\n\n───────────────────────────────  \nStep (b): Fixed–Target (e⁺ beam on e⁻ at rest)\n\nNow the target electron is at rest in the laboratory. Let the positron beam have energy E (we denote it by E_beam now) and momentum p. Its four–momentum is (E, p), with E² = p² + m_e² (we always use units in which c = 1). The target electron’s four–momentum is (m_e, 0). The square of the total four–momentum is\n\n  s = (p_{e⁺} + p_{e⁻})²\n    = m_e² + m_e² + 2 m_e E      [since the spatial momentum of the target is zero]\n    = 2 m_e (E + m_e).\n\nTo produce the Z⁰ we need √s = M_Z. That is,\n  M_Z² = 2 m_e (E + m_e).\n\nSolving for E:\n  E = (M_Z²/(2 m_e)) – m_e.\n\nSince M_Z ≫ m_e (m_e ≃ 0.000511 GeV) the m_e term is utterly negligible. Inserting the numbers we have\n\n  E ≃ (92² GeV²)/(2 × 0.000511 GeV)\n    = (8464 GeV²)/(0.001022 GeV)\n    ≃ 8.28 × 10⁶ GeV.\n\nIt is often useful to convert into TeV:\n  8.28 × 10⁶ GeV = 8.28 × 10³ TeV,\ni.e. about 8280 TeV.

(Since the two–body decay produces a back–to–back pair, the π⁻ is emitted in the opposite direction to the Λ⁰ in the Ξ⁻ rest frame.)\n\nOur procedure is as follows:\n 1. Find the magnitude of the momentum in the Ξ⁻ rest frame (the “decay momentum”) using energy–momentum conservation.\n 2. Write the 4–momenta of Λ⁰ (and π⁻) in the Ξ⁻ rest frame.\n 3. Boost these 4–momenta to the lab frame (knowing the boost is along the x-axis).\n 4.

Transformations under Parity (P) and Time Reversal (T):\n\n(a) Under the parity operator P, spatial coordinates reverse sign. Therefore:\n • The momentum, being a polar vector, transforms as\n  p → –p.\n • The spin, being an axial vector (involving a cross product of two polar vectors), remains unchanged:\n  s → s.\n\nUnder the time reversal operator T, not only are the coordinates time‐reversed, but velocities (and hence momentum) and angular momenta (including spin) reverse sign. Thus:\n • The momentum transforms as\n  p → –p.\n • The spin transforms as\n  s → –s.\n\nThus, our answer for part (a) is:\n • Under P: p → –p, s → s.\n • Under T: p → –p, s → –s.\n\nStep 2. Looking for T Violation in Λ → N + π:\n\n(b) Since the spin and momenta transform differently under T and P, one can construct observables (or correlations) that are odd under time reversal but even under parity. A common choice is to look at a triple correlation of the form\n\n  s_Λ · (p_N × p_π).\n\nLet us check its properties:\n • Under parity: p_N and p_π each change sign, so the cross product (p_N × p_π) is invariant (since (–p_N × –p_π) = p_N × p_π). The Λ spin s_Λ remains unchanged under P, so the triple product is even under P.\n • Under time reversal: Both momenta and spin change sign. Thus p_N and p_π contribute a sign flip each and s_Λ a sign flip,\n  s_Λ → –s_Λ, p_N → –p_N, p_π → –p_π,\nso the cross product (–p_N × –p_π) remains unchanged (as (–p_N × –p_π) = p_N × p_π), but the overall triple product changes sign,\n  s_Λ · (p_N × p_π) → (–s_Λ) · (p_N × p_π) = –[s_Λ · (p_N × p_π)].\nThus, s_Λ · (p_N × p_π) is odd under T.\n\nA nonzero expectation value for this T–odd observable in the decay would be an indication of T violation. However, one must be cautious: even if the underlying interaction is T–invariant, final state interactions (the so–called “strong phases”) can mimic a T–odd effect. Therefore, any experimental claim for time reversal violation must carefully estimate and subtract the effects arising from final state rescattering.\n\nFurthermore, from an experimental point of view, one needs a polarized Λ beam or a way to determine the polarization of Λ (which comes from its production mechanism) so that the initial s_Λ is well‐known. Without such control, measuring the correlation would be ambiguous.\n\nThus, for part (b), one may look for a nonzero triple correlation s_Λ · (p_N × p_π) in the decay Λ → N + π, but it is crucial to have control over and understand possible final state interactions, as well as having a means of determining the initial polarization of the Λ.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\hat{P}:~ \\mathbf{p} \\to -\\mathbf{p},\\quad \\mathbf{s} \\to \\mathbf{s};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\hat{T}:~ \\mathbf{p} \\to -\\mathbf{p},\\quad \\mathbf{s} \\to -\\mathbf{s}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{One may search for T-violation by measuring a T-odd observable, e.g., }\\\\\n&\\quad \\mathbf{s}_\\Lambda \\cdot (\\mathbf{p}_N \\times \\mathbf{p}_\\pi).\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{A nonzero expectation value indicates T violation, provided that effects} \\\\\n&\\text{due to final state interactions are carefully estimated and the initial } \\\\\n&\\text{$\\Lambda$ polarization is well determined.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\hat{P}:~ \\mathbf{p} \\to -\\mathbf{p},\\quad \\mathbf{s} \\to \\mathbf{s};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\hat{T}:~ \\mathbf{p} \\to -\\mathbf{p},\\quad \\mathbf{s} \\to -\\mathbf{s}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{One may search for T-violation by measuring a T-odd observable, e.g., }\\\\\n&\\quad \\mathbf{s}_\\Lambda \\cdot (\\mathbf{p}_N \\times \\mathbf{p}_\\pi).\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{A nonzero expectation value indicates T violation, provided that effects} \\\\\n&\\text{due to final state interactions are carefully estimated and the initial } \\\\\n&\\text{$\\Lambda$ polarization is well determined.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\hat{P}:~ \\mathbf{p} \\to -\\mathbf{p},\\quad \\mathbf{s} \\to \\mathbf{s};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\hat{T}:~ \\mathbf{p} \\to -\\mathbf{p},\\quad \\mathbf{s} \\to -\\mathbf{s}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{One may search for T-violation by measuring a T-odd observable, e.g., }\\\\\n&\\quad \\mathbf{s}_\\Lambda \\cdot (\\mathbf{p}_N \\times \\mathbf{p}_\\pi).\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{A nonzero expectation value indicates T violation, provided that effects} \\\\\n&\\text{due to final state interactions are carefully estimated and the initial } \\\\\n&\\text{$\\Lambda$ polarization is well determined.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\hat{P}\\mathbf{s}\\hat{P}^{-1} = \\mathbf{s}, \\quad \\hat{P}\\mathbf{p}\\hat{P}^{-1} = -\\mathbf{p}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\hat{P}:~ \\mathbf{p} \\to -\\mathbf{p},\\quad \\mathbf{s} \\to \\mathbf{s};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\hat{T}:~ \\mathbf{p} \\to -\\mathbf{p},\\quad \\mathbf{s} \\to -\\mathbf{s}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{One may search for T-violation by measuring a T-odd observable, e.g., }\\\\\n&\\quad \\mathbf{s}_\\Lambda \\cdot (\\mathbf{p}_N \\times \\mathbf{p}_\\pi).\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{A nonzero expectation value indicates T violation, provided that effects} \\\\\n&\\text{due to final state interactions are carefully estimated and the initial } \\\\\n&\\text{$\\Lambda$ polarization is well determined.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\hat{T} \\mathbf{s} \\hat{T}^{-1} = -\\mathbf{s}, \\quad \\hat{T} \\mathbf{p} \\hat{T}^{-1} = -\\mathbf{p}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "atomic/4-26", "solution": "We will answer each part step by step.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 1. (a) Writing the Reaction Equation\n\nA negative muon (μ⁻) is a charged lepton similar to the electron but about 207 times heavier. Its decay is mediated by the weak interaction. One common decay mode is into an electron (e⁻), an electron‐antineutrino ( \\( \\bar{\\nu}_e\\) ), and a muon neutrino ( \\( \\nu_\\mu\\) ). Thus one can write the decay reaction as\n\n  μ⁻ → e⁻ + \\( \\bar{\\nu}_e\\) + \\( \\nu_\\mu\\).\n\nIn words, the particles involved are:\n • The μ⁻ (negative muon), a heavy charged lepton.\n • The e⁻ (electron), a light charged lepton.\n • The \\( \\bar{\\nu}_e\\) (electron antineutrino), the anti‐particle associated with the electron.\n • The \\( \\nu_\\mu\\) (muon neutrino), the neutrino associated with the muon.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 2. (b) Can a Lepton from This Decay Convert a Proton into a Neutron?\n\nOne might ask if one of the leptons produced in the muon decay could “convert” a proton at rest into a neutron. The relevant process to consider is similar to electron capture by a proton. In ordinary electron capture within a nucleus the process is\n\n  p + e⁻ → n + \\( \\nu_e\\),\n\nwhere a proton (p) combines with an electron (e⁻) to form a neutron (n) and an electron neutrino (\\( \\nu_e\\)). For a free proton, one must consider the energy balance. The rest masses are approximately:\n\n • m(p) ≈ 938.272 MeV,  \n • m(e) ≈ 0.511 MeV,  \n • m(n) ≈ 939.565 MeV.\n\nThus the total rest energy of the initial state is\n\n  938.272 MeV + 0.511 MeV = 938.783 MeV\n\nand that of the final neutron is about 939.565 MeV. This shows that an extra roughly\n\n  939.565 MeV – 938.783 MeV ≈ 0.782 MeV\n\nis needed. In other words, the electron must bring at least about 0.782 MeV of kinetic energy in order for the reaction to be energetically possible.\n\nWhen a μ⁻ decays at rest its available energy is the muon rest mass (about 105.66 MeV) which is shared among the three products.

{"id": "atomic/3-31", "solution": "We now show step‐by‐step how one may arrive at the answers.\n\nLet us consider the reaction\n\n  π⁻ + d → n + n\n\nwhere the deuteron is in a ³S₁ state (i.e. a spin–triplet with zero orbital angular momentum) and the pion is a pseudoscalar (J^P = 0⁻). (We assume here that any possible small corrections due to the long‐range Coulomb wave function in the atomic state are not important for the angular momentum/isospin selection rules.) Conservation of angular momentum and parity in the strong interaction fixes the quantum numbers of the final two–neutron state.\n\n─────────────────────────────\n\nStep 1. (Orbital Angular Momentum)\n\nThe intrinsic parity of the pion is “odd” (–) while that of the deuteron (made from nucleons with intrinsic parity + and with L = 0) is “even” (+). Thus the initial state parity is\n\n  P_initial = P(π) × P(d) = (–)(+) = –.\n\nIn the final state the intrinsic parity of two neutrons is (+)(+)= +, so that any overall parity must come from the orbital motion. Since the parity associated with orbital angular momentum L is (–1)^L, parity conservation requires\n\n  (–1)^L = P_final = P_initial = –   ⟹   L odd.\n\nFor the reaction to occur near threshold the smallest possible L is favored so we must have L = 1.\n\nThus, (a) the orbital angular momentum of the neutron pair is L = 1 (a P–wave).\n\n─────────────────────────────\n\nStep 2. (Spin of the Two Neutrons)\n\nThe deuteron has total angular momentum J = 1 coming entirely from spin (S = 1) as it is in an S–wave. The π–meson carries no spin. Therefore total J_initial = 1.\n\nNow, the two neutrons are identical fermions. Their full wave function must be antisymmetric under exchange. Their isospin state will be symmetric because two neutrons, having the same third‐component, necessarily combine into an isospin I = 1 state (recall that the deuteron has I = 0, so there is, in fact, an isospin flip in the reaction). Since the spatial (orbital, L = 1) part is antisymmetric (because an L = 1 orbital wave function changes sign under exchange, due to the factor (–1)^L = –1) the spin part must be symmetric so that the overall spin ⊗ space wave function is antisymmetric when multiplied by the symmetric isospin part. (That is, one has “antisymmetric spatial” × “symmetric spin” × “symmetric isospin” giving an overall antisymmetric state.) For two spin–½ particles a symmetric spin state means S = 1 (the “triplet”). \n\nThus, (b) the two neutrons are in a spin–triplet state (S = 1).\n\n─────────────────────────────\n\nStep 3. (Probability that Both Neutron Spins are Opposite to the Deuteron’s Spin)\n\nLet us adopt our quantization (z–axis) so that the initial deuteron is 100% polarized with spin “up” (m_d = +1). In the final state the two–neutron system must also have total J = 1. Since we already have L = 1 and S = 1, the two vectors couple to produce J = 1. Writing the Clebsch–Gordan expansion we have\n\n  |J = 1, M = +1⟩ = √(2/3) |L = 1, m_L = +1⟩|S = 1, m_S = 0⟩\n         + √(1/3) |L = 1, m_L = 0⟩|S = 1, m_S = +1⟩.\n\nNow, in a two–spin–½ system the triplet states are given by\n\n  |1, +1⟩ = |↑↑⟩,\n  |1, 0⟩ = 1/√2 (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩),\n  |1, –1⟩ = |↓↓⟩.\n\nNotice that the possibility for both neutron spins to be “down” (i.e. opposite to the deuteron’s spin) corresponds to the m_S = –1 state: |↓↓⟩. However, in the expansion above there is no contribution from the m_S = –1 part. (In fact, since M = m_L + m_S = +1 and m_S = –1 would require m_L = +2, which is impossible for L = 1.) \n\nThus, (c) the probability for finding both neutron spins directed opposite to the deuteron’s spin is zero.\n\n─────────────────────────────\n\nStep 4. (Angular Dependence for a Neutron with Spin Opposite to the Deuteron)\n\nStill assuming the deuteron is polarized with m_d = +1, the final two–neutron state is\n\n  |Ψ_final⟩ = √(2/3) Y₁^(+1)(θ, φ) |S = 1, m_S = 0⟩ + √(1/3) Y₁^(0)(θ, φ) |S = 1, m_S = +1⟩.\n\nNow, when measuring the spin of an individual neutron, even though the two–particle state is entangled, one may ask: what is the angular distribution (i.e. the dependence on the emission angles θ and φ) for the neutron that is observed with its spin “down” (i.e. opposite to the deuteron’s polarization direction)?\n\nExamine the two pieces:\n• The second term carries |S = 1, m_S = +1⟩ = |↑↑⟩ so that both neutrons are “up”. It cannot contribute to an event where one neutron is measured “down.”\n• The first term has |S = 1, m_S = 0⟩ = 1/√2 (|↑↓⟩ + |↓↑⟩); a given neutron in this configuration has a 50% chance (1/2) of being spin “down.”\n\nThus, the only contribution for detecting a “down” neutron comes from the m_S = 0 piece, with amplitude\n\n  A(θ, φ) = √(2/3) Y₁^(+1)(θ, φ) × (1/√2) = √(1/3) Y₁^(+1)(θ, φ).\n\nRecalling the given spherical harmonic\n\n  Y₁^(+1)(θ, φ) = – sin θ e^(+iφ),\n\nwe deduce that the probability (per unit solid angle) is proportional to\n\n  |A(θ, φ)|² ∝ (1/3) |sin θ|² = (1/3) sin²θ.\n\nThus, (d) if the deuteron’s spin is 100% polarized in the k–direction, the angular distribution (up to an overall normalization) for detecting a neutron whose spin is opposite (down) is\n\n  dW/dΩ ∝ sin²θ.\n\n─────────────────────────────\n\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) L = 1.\n\n(b) S = 1 (the two neutrons form a spin–triplet).\n\n(c) The probability for both neutron spins to be opposite to the deuteron’s spin is zero.\n\n(d) For a 100% polarized deuteron (spin up), the angular distribution (per unit solid angle) for a neutron detected with spin down is proportional to sin²θ; i.e.,\n  dW/dΩ ∝ sin²θ.\n\nThus, our final boxed answers are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\quad L=1,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}&\\quad S=1,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}&\\quad P(\\text{both spins down})=0,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}&\\quad \\frac{dW}{d\\Omega}\\propto\\sin^2\\theta.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\quad L=1,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}&\\quad S=1,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}&\\quad P(\\text{both spins down})=0,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}&\\quad \\frac{dW}{d\\Omega}\\propto\\sin^2\\theta.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\quad L=1,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}&\\quad S=1,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}&\\quad P(\\text{both spins down})=0,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}&\\quad \\frac{dW}{d\\Omega}\\propto\\sin^2\\theta.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "L = 1"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\quad L=1,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}&\\quad S=1,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}&\\quad P(\\text{both spins down})=0,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}&\\quad \\frac{dW}{d\\Omega}\\propto\\sin^2\\theta.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "S = 1"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\quad L=1,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}&\\quad S=1,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}&\\quad P(\\text{both spins down})=0,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}&\\quad \\frac{dW}{d\\Omega}\\propto\\sin^2\\theta.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\quad L=1,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}&\\quad S=1,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}&\\quad P(\\text{both spins down})=0,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}&\\quad \\frac{dW}{d\\Omega}\\propto\\sin^2\\theta.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{3}{8\\pi} \\sin^2 \\theta"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Time-reversal invariance tells us that the invariant amplitude (and hence |M|²) is the same for both reactions. However, the phase space (and also the flux factors) are different.\n\nBelow we describe in some detail how the relation comes about.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1.

However, one must also recall that the numerical factors that enter the “averaged” |M|² depend on the number of polarization (or spin) states in the initial channel.

Reaction II Threshold and Near‐Threshold Behavior\n\nFor reaction (II): π⁺ + n → γ + p, the initial particles have masses μ and m respectively. Thus the minimal invariant mass (the “threshold” in the center‐of‐mass frame) is\n\n  W_thresh = m + μ.  (8)\n\nNext, notice that in reaction (I) the center‐of‐mass phase–space factor (and hence σI) contains a factor qπ (as seen in Eq. (2)). In most realistic cases the amplitude |M|² is a smooth function of energy, so near threshold we expect\n\n  σI(W) ∝ qπ   (as W → m + μ).\n    (9)\n\nNow, from (5),\n\n  σII(W) = 2 (kγ/qπ)² σI(W).  (5, repeated)\n\nSince the photon is massless, kγ (given in (6)) is nonzero at threshold even though qπ goes to zero (qπ ∝ √(W – (m + μ))). Therefore, very near threshold we have\n\n  σII(W) ∝ (1/qπ) ∝ 1/√(W – (m + μ)).  (10)\n\nThat is, just above threshold the cross section for reaction (II) rises very sharply, diverging as 1/√(W – (m + μ)) (this divergence is a typical kinematical consequence when the reaction rate is expressed in terms of a cross section with an incident particle whose flux vanishes at threshold).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) Detailed balance predicts that\n\n  σII(W) = 2 (kγ(W)/qπ(W))² σI(W),\n\nwith\n  kγ(W) = (W² – m²)/(2W) and qπ(W) = [((W² – (m + μ)²)(W² – (m – μ)²)]^(1/2)/(2W).\n\n(b) For reaction (II) the threshold energy in the center‐of‐mass frame is\n\n  W_thresh = m + μ,\n\nand since σI(W) ∝ qπ ∝ √(W – (m + μ)) just above threshold, it follows that\n\n  σII(W) ∝ 1/√(W – (m + μ)) as W → (m + μ)+.\n\nThus, while σI vanishes in a “usual” square‐root fashion as threshold is approached, σII (defined via the vanishing flux of the low–energy pion) diverges as 1/√(W – (m + μ)).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Latex Boxed Form\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad\n\\sigma_{II}(W) &= 2\\left(\\frac{k_\\gamma(W)}{q_\\pi(W)}\\right)^2 \\sigma_I(W),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{with}\\quad\nk_\\gamma(W) &= \\frac{W^2 - m^2}{2W},\\quad\nq_\\pi(W) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\left[W^2-(m+\\mu)^2\\right]\\left[W^2-(m-\\mu)^2\\right]}}{2W}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\text{(b)}\\quad\nW_{\\text{thresh}} = m+\\mu,\\quad \\text{and near threshold}\\quad \\sigma_{II}(W) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{W-(m+\\mu)}}.\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad\n\\sigma_{II}(W) &= 2\\left(\\frac{k_\\gamma(W)}{q_\\pi(W)}\\right)^2 \\sigma_I(W),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{with}\\quad\nk_\\gamma(W) &= \\frac{W^2 - m^2}{2W},\\quad\nq_\\pi(W) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\left[W^2-(m+\\mu)^2\\right]\\left[W^2-(m-\\mu)^2\\right]}}{2W}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\text{(b)}\\quad\nW_{\\text{thresh}} = m+\\mu,\\quad \\text{and near threshold}\\quad \\sigma_{II}(W) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{W-(m+\\mu)}}."], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad\n\\sigma_{II}(W) &= 2\\left(\\frac{k_\\gamma(W)}{q_\\pi(W)}\\right)^2 \\sigma_I(W),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{with}\\quad\nk_\\gamma(W) &= \\frac{W^2 - m^2}{2W},\\quad\nq_\\pi(W) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\left[W^2-(m+\\mu)^2\\right]\\left[W^2-(m-\\mu)^2\\right]}}{2W}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\text{(b)}\\quad\nW_{\\text{thresh}} = m+\\mu,\\quad \\text{and near threshold}\\quad \\sigma_{II}(W) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{W-(m+\\mu)}}.", "expr2": "\\sigma_{II}(W) = \\frac{(W^2 - m^2)^2}{(W^2 + m^2 - \\mu^2)^2 - 4W^2m^2} \\sigma_I(W)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Since the π⁰ momentum p is the same as that of the K⁻, we have\n  p² = Eₖ² - m_{K⁻}².\n\nThus, the energy of the π⁰ becomes\n  E_π = √(m_{π⁰}² + Eₖ² - m_{K⁻}²).\n\nThen, energy conservation (2) becomes\n\n  Eₖ + m_p = √(m_{π⁰}² + Eₖ² - m_{K⁻}²) + m_Λ.\n\nStep 4. Rearrange to isolate the square root term:\n\n  Eₖ - (m_Λ - m_p) = √(Eₖ² - m_{K⁻}² + m_{π⁰}²).\n\nStep 5. Square both sides to remove the square root:\n\n  [Eₖ - (m_Λ - m_p)]² = Eₖ² - m_{K⁻}² + m_{π⁰}².\n\nExpanding the left-hand side yields\n\n  Eₖ² - 2Eₖ(m_Λ - m_p) + (m_Λ - m_p)² = Eₖ² - m_{K⁻}² + m_{π⁰}².\n\nNotice that Eₖ² cancels out on both sides. We are then left with\n\n  - 2Eₖ(m_Λ - m_p) + (m_Λ - m_p)² = - m_{K⁻}² + m_{π⁰}².\n\nStep 6. Solve for Eₖ:\n\nFirst, bring the term with Eₖ to one side:\n  2Eₖ(m_Λ - m_p) = m_{K⁻}² - m_{π⁰}² + (m_Λ - m_p)².\n\nThus,\n\n  Eₖ = [m_{K⁻}² - m_{π⁰}² + (m_Λ - m_p)²] / [2 (m_Λ - m_p)].\n\nThis is the special value of the incident K⁻ energy such that the Λ⁰ is produced at rest in the laboratory.\n\nFinal Answer in boxed LaTeX:\n  \\[\\boxed{ E_{K^-} = \\frac{m_{K^-}^2 - m_{\\pi^0}^2 + \\left(m_{\\Lambda^0} - m_p\\right)^2}{2\\left(m_{\\Lambda^0} - m_p\\right)} }\\]", "final_answers": ["E_{K^-} = \\frac{m_{K^-}^2 - m_{\\pi^0}^2 + \\left(m_{\\Lambda^0} - m_p\\right)^2}{2\\left(m_{\\Lambda^0} - m_p\\right)}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "E_{K^-} = \\frac{m_{K^-}^2 - m_{\\pi^0}^2 + \\left(m_{\\Lambda^0} - m_p\\right)^2}{2\\left(m_{\\Lambda^0} - m_p\\right)}", "expr2": "E_K = \\frac{m_K^2 - m_{\\pi}^2 + (m_{\\Lambda} - m_p)^2}{2(m_{\\Lambda} - m_p)}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "zoo*m**2", "expr2": "zoo*m**2"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

The reaction is\n\n  γ + e⁻ (at rest) → e⁻ + e⁻ + e⁺.\n\nNotice that the final state contains three particles (two electrons and one positron). Since the process must conserve both energy and momentum, the threshold condition is when the final particles have just the minimum energy required – their rest mass energies – with as little kinetic energy as allowed by momentum conservation.\n\nStep 1. Find the invariant (center-of-mass energy squared)\n\nThe 4‐momentum square (s) is invariant. In the lab frame the incoming photon has energy E (and momentum magnitude E, in units where c = 1) and the electron is at rest (energy m and zero momentum). Thus,\n  s = (p_γ + p_e)² = p_γ² + 2p_γ·p_e + p_e².\n\nSince the photon is massless, p_γ² = 0, and p_e² = m².

Apply the threshold condition\n\nAt threshold, the final particles are produced with minimal (in fact, no excess) kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame, so their total energy equals the sum of their rest energies. There are three particles (two electrons and one positron), each of mass m, so the total rest energy is 3m. Therefore the invariant mass squared must be\n\n  s_threshold = (3m)² = 9m².\n\nStep 3.

{"id": "atomic/3-9", "solution": "Below is a step‐by‐step discussion of four topics selected from the list:\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. J/ψ Particle\n\nThe J/ψ particle is a meson discovered in 1974 that sparked the “November Revolution” in particle physics. It is made up of a charm quark and its antiparticle (c c̄). Because of the heavy charm quarks, its mass is relatively high, and it exhibits a narrow width, meaning it decays more slowly than other hadronic resonances. Its discovery provided strong indirect evidence for the existence of the charm quark and led to a dramatic expansion in our understanding of quark structure and quantum chromodynamics (QCD).\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Neutral K Meson System (Including Regeneration of K_S)\n\nThe neutral kaon system involves the particles K⁰ and the anti-kaon K̄⁰, which for weak interactions are not mass eigenstates. Instead, they mix to form the short-lived K_S and the long-lived K_L states. A very interesting phenomenon associated with this system is “regeneration.” When a beam of K_L mesons passes through matter, interactions with the nuclei can convert part of the K_L beam into K_S mesons due to the differential absorptive properties of the medium in relation to the two components. This effect is a beautiful demonstration of quantum coherence and interference in particle physics, and it historically played a significant role in establishing the concept of CP violation in the neutral kaon system.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. The Two Types of Neutrino\n\nHistorically, two distinct neutrino types were identified: the electron neutrino (νₑ) and the muon neutrino (ν_μ). These neutrinos are associated with their corresponding charged leptons (the electron and the muon). Their separate existence is evidenced by the fact that in weak interactions (such as beta decay or muon decay), the conservation of lepton family number forbids, for instance, the conversion of a muon neutrino into an electron neutrino without violating observed conservation laws. The distinct behavior of these neutrinos underlies the structure of the weak interaction and led to the formulation of the V–A (vector-minus-axial vector) theory. (Later, a third neutrino, the tau neutrino, was also discovered, but the original “two types” remain central to early weak interaction theory.) \n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Abnormal Magnetic Moment of the Muon\n\nThe muon’s magnetic moment is a key precision observable. In Dirac theory one expects a gyromagnetic ratio (g) of exactly 2; however, quantum corrections from QED, hadronic contributions, and weak interactions introduce a small anomaly so that g = 2(1 + a_μ) with a_μ being the anomalous magnetic moment. Experimentally, a_μ has been measured to high precision, and there exists a slight discrepancy with the Standard Model prediction. This “abnormal” magnetic moment (often simply called the muon g–2 anomaly) is of intense interest because it might be a window into physics beyond the Standard Model – indicating contributions from new particles or forces that have yet to be discovered.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Box:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\textbf{J/}\\psi\\ \\textbf{Particle: A bound state of charm and anti-charm quarks, its discovery in 1974 provided key evidence for the charm quark and validated QCD.} \\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{Neutral }K\\textbf{ Meson System: The K^0\\mbox{-}\\overline{K^0} mixing produces the CP eigenstates K_S and K_L;

Solve (1) for E:\n  a₀ ≈ (½) (eE/mₑ) t²  ⟹ E ≈ (2 mₑ a₀)/(e t²)  (2)\n\nStep 4. What should we take for t? The typical orbital time can be estimated using the Bohr model. In a rough way, the electron’s speed in the ground state is on the order of\n  v ~ αc    (with α ≈ 1/137, c = 3×10⁸ m/s),\nand the Bohr radius is\n  a₀ ≈ 5.29×10⁻¹¹ m.\nThus, an order‐of‐magnitude estimate for the orbital period is:\n  t ≈ (2π a₀)/v = 2πa₀/(αc).\n\nLet’s estimate t numerically:\n  v ≈ (3×10⁸ m/s)/137 ≈ 2.2×10⁶ m/s.\n  t ≈ (2π × 5.3×10⁻¹¹ m)/(2.2×10⁶ m/s)\n    ≈ (3.33×10⁻¹⁰ m)/(2.2×10⁶ m/s)\n    ≈ 1.5×10⁻¹⁶ s.\n\nStep 5. Now plug in the numbers into (2):\n  E ≈ (2 × 9.1×10⁻³¹ kg × 5.3×10⁻¹¹ m) / (1.6×10⁻¹⁹ C × (1.5×10⁻¹⁶ s)²).\n\nFirst, compute the numerator:\n  Numerator = 2 × 9.1×10⁻³¹ × 5.3×10⁻¹¹ ≈ 9.65×10⁻⁴¹ kg·m.\n\nNext, compute the denominator:\n  (1.5×10⁻¹⁶ s)² = 2.25×10⁻³² s²,\n  So Denom = 1.6×10⁻¹⁹ C × 2.25×10⁻³² = 3.6×10⁻⁵¹ C·s².\n\nThus:\n  E ≈ (9.65×10⁻⁴¹) / (3.6×10⁻⁵¹)\n    ≈ 2.68×10¹⁰ V/m.\n\nSince our time estimate was rough (1.5×10⁻¹⁶ s is an order-of-magnitude estimate), our answer is roughly\n  E ~ 10¹⁰ to 10¹¹ V/m.\n\nIn many simple treatments one argues that the field must do work over a distance a₀ comparable to the binding energy (∼13.6 eV for hydrogen). That is, setting\n  e E a₀ ~ 13.6 eV.\nConverting 13.6 eV to Joules:\n  13.6 eV ≈ 2.18×10⁻¹⁸ J,\nso one finds:\n  E ≈ (2.18×10⁻¹⁸ J)/(1.6×10⁻¹⁹ C × 5.3×10⁻¹¹ m)\n    ≈ (2.18×10⁻¹⁸)/(8.48×10⁻³⁰)\n    ≈ 2.57×10¹¹ V/m.\nThis stronger field is what one would expect if one “overcomes” the binding energy in a static picture. In our case, however, we want the electron to leave the atom on the very short time scale of one orbital period, so our earlier estimate based on acceleration provides an electric field of order 10¹⁰–10¹¹ V/m.\n\nFinal Answer:\nFor an order-of-magnitude estimate, the electric field required is on the order of 10¹¹ V/m.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{E \\sim 10^{11} \\, \\text{V/m}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["E \\sim 10^{11} \\, \\text{V/m}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "E \\sim 10^{11} \\, \\text{V/m}", "expr2": "E \\gtrsim 2 \\times 10^9 \\, Z^3 \\, \\text{V/cm}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Here is how the test works and when it might be of limited use:\n\nStep 1. Measuring the Angular Distribution\n\nWhen a Λ⁰ decays to a proton and a pion, its spin (if known) can provide a reference axis. The proton’s angular distribution in the Λ⁰ rest frame is generally written as\n\n  W(θ) ∝ 1 + α cos θ,\n\nwhere\n • θ is the angle between the proton’s momentum and the Λ⁰ polarization direction,\n • α is the decay (asymmetry) parameter.\n\nStep 2. Parity Conservation and the Asymmetry Parameter\n\nUnder parity conservation the law of reflection (θ → π – θ, essentially a mirror reflection of the spatial coordinates) demands that the angular distribution be symmetric, that is, there should be no preferred direction. In other words, if parity were conserved, one would expect α = 0. A nonzero value of α signals a forward–backward asymmetry in the emission of the decay proton with respect to the polarization direction, implying parity violation.\n\nStep 3. Practical Test\n\nThus, if one has a sample of Λ⁰ baryons with a known polarization, one can measure the angular distribution of the emitted protons. If the distribution is asymmetric (i.e., if α is found to be nonzero), then parity is violated in this decay.\n\nStep 4. Circumstances That May Prevent the Usefulness of the Test\n\nThere are a couple of reasons why this test might not be useful:\n\n1. Unpolarized Λ⁰:  \n If the Λ⁰’s are produced without a net polarization, then there is no preferred spin direction to correlate with the direction of the proton. In such a case, the angular distribution of decay products will be isotropic, making it impossible to extract information about parity violation.\n\n2. Experimental Limitations:  \n If the detector does not have sufficient angular resolution or if there are systematic errors in determining the Λ⁰ spin direction, then the measurement of α may be ambiguous.  \n Also, if other processes or final state interactions obscure the simple angular correlation expected in the decay, then interpreting the results in terms of parity conservation may be complicated.\n\nStep 5. Final Summary\n\nThe parity test relies on measuring an asymmetry in the angular distribution of the proton with respect to the Λ⁰ spin. A nonzero asymmetry parameter (α ≠ 0) indicates parity violation. However, if the Λ⁰ baryons are unpolarized or if experimental issues prevent a clean determination of the decay asymmetry, the test may not provide useful information about parity conservation.\n\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Box:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The test involves measuring the proton’s angular distribution relative to the Λ⁰ polarization.

We must estimate the number of target ^37Cl atoms present and then “multiply” by the neutrino capture rate.\n\nBelow is one way to do the estimate:\n\n──────────────────────────── Step 1. Estimating the Number of ^37Cl Atoms\n\nAssume the following:\n (1) The detector uses a chemical such as perchloroethylene. (Sometimes the text writes “tetrachlorethylene” and “CCl₄”; the key point is that it is a chlorine‐rich liquid.) For our purposes we assume the liquid is perchloroethylene with formula C₂Cl₄.\n (2) Its density is about 1.62 g/cm³.\n (3) The volume of the detector is V = 4×10^5 liters. (Since 1 liter = 10³ cm³, the volume in cubic centimeters is)\n   V = 4×10^5 L × 10³ cm³/L = 4×10^8 cm³.\n (4) Thus, its total mass is\n   m = density × volume ≈ (1.62 g/cm³)(4×10^8 cm³) ≈ 6.48×10^8 g.\n (5) The molar mass of C₂Cl₄ is\n   M = (2×12.0 + 4×35.45) g/mol ≈ (24.0 + 141.8) g/mol ≈ 165.8 g/mol.\n (6) The number of moles of C₂Cl₄ is\n   n = m/M ≈ (6.48×10^8 g)/(165.8 g/mol) ≈ 3.91×10^6 mol.\n (7) The number of molecules is then\n   N_mol = n×N_A ≈ 3.91×10^6 mol × 6.02×10^23 molec/mol ≈ 2.35×10^30 molecules.\n (8) Each molecule has 4 chlorine atoms, so the total number of Cl atoms is\n   N_Cl ≈ 4×2.35×10^30 ≈ 9.41×10^30.\n (9) Natural chlorine consists of about 75.8% ^35Cl and about 24.2% ^37Cl.

Estimating the Capture Rate\n\nNeutrino–nucleus reactions are very rare. In solar neutrino detection experiments the reaction rate is traditionally given in “SNU” where\n\n  1 SNU = 10^–36 captures per target atom per second.\n\nDetailed solar model calculations give an expected capture rate on chlorine of roughly 8 SNU (the exact number depends on the solar model and neutrino oscillations, but our goal here is an order‐of‐magnitude estimate).\n\nThus, the capture rate per target atom is\n\n  R_atom ≈ 8×10^–36 s^–1.\n\nThen the total number of captures (i.e. ^37Ar atoms produced) per second in the target is\n\n  R_total = N_target × (8×10^–36 s^–1)\n     ≈ (2.28×10^30)(8×10^–36)\n     ≈ 1.824×10^–5 s^–1.\n\nConverting to a per‐day rate, note that one day has 86400 seconds.

The molecular weight of the liquid is taken to be ≈165.8 g/mol (i.e. for C₂Cl₄).\n3. The natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is 75.8% ^35Cl and 24.2% ^37Cl.\n4. The effective capture rate on ^37Cl, integrated over the solar neutrino energy spectrum, is assumed to be 8 SNU (8×10^–36 s^–1 per target atom).\n5. It is assumed that every neutrino capture on ^37Cl produces a detectable ^37Ar nucleus and that there are no losses (i.e. extraction efficiencies are 100%).\n6. We have neglected background processes and assumed that the composition and density of the liquid are uniform.\n\n──────────────────────────── Step 4. How Can the Experiment Be Improved?\n\nSeveral improvements can be made:\n\n• Increase the target mass or use a liquid with an even higher chlorine density to increase the number of available ^37Cl atoms.\n• Improve the chemical extraction and counting efficiency so that nearly all the produced ^37Ar nuclei are collected and identified.\n• Reduce background signals (from radioactivity, cosmic rays, or other sources) by better shielding and purification.\n• Increase the running time and/or improve the signal‐to‐noise ratio (for example by using improved radiochemical separation methods).\n• Consider alternative detection media or techniques (such as real‐time detectors) that might have higher cross sections or allow continuous monitoring.\n\n──────────────────────────── Final Answer\n\nThe estimated production is on the order of 1–2 ^37Ar atoms per day.\n\n  \\[\\boxed{\\text{About }1{-}2\\,\\text{atoms of }^{37}\\text{Ar are produced per day.}}\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{About }1{-}2\\,\\text{atoms of }^{37}\\text{Ar are produced per day.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{About }1{-}2\\,\\text{atoms of }^{37}\\text{Ar are produced per day.}", "expr2": "480"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Understanding the decay chain\n\n(a) First, a π⁺ (spin-0) decays by\n  π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν₍μ₎.\nBecause the pion is spinless, its decay is isotropic even though the decay process is governed by the weak interaction (which violates parity through its only left-handed couplings). However, the weak interaction gives a definite helicity to the produced muon (μ⁺) and neutrino. In fact, the V–A structure forces the muon to be produced in a highly polarized state.\n\n(b) The muon then decays:\n  μ⁺ → e⁺ + ν₍e₎ + ͞ν₍μ₎.\nSince the muon is now polarized, the distribution of its decay products (the positrons, in particular) is not isotropic. This anisotropy is the observable quantity that carries the imprint of parity violation.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Observable Quantity: Angular Distribution\n\nThe key observable is the angular distribution of the positrons (e⁺) in the decay μ⁺ → e⁺ + ν₍e₎ + ͞ν₍μ₎ relative to the spin direction of the muon. Because the weak interaction preferentially couples to left-handed particles and right-handed antiparticles, the direction in which the e⁺ is emitted will be correlated with the muon’s spin.\n\nA typical form for the angular distribution is given by:\n\n  dN/dΩ ∝ 1 + α cos θ\n\nor equivalently,\n\n  dN/d(cos θ) ∝ 1 + α cos θ\n\nwhere:\n • θ is the angle between the positron momentum vector and the muon polarization (spin) direction.\n • α is an asymmetry parameter (which is nonzero due to the V–A interaction), and its value is determined by the details of the decay matrix element.\n\nA sketch of the distribution would show that more positrons are emitted in the “forward” direction (θ = 0) relative to the muon spin than in the “backward” direction (θ = π).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Which Process Violates Parity?\n\nAlthough both the pion decay and the muon decay are mediated by weak interactions (which are known to violate parity), only the μ⁺ decay reveals the asymmetry when examined experimentally.\n\n• In the case of π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν₍μ₎, the pion’s zero spin forces an isotropic distribution of the decay products. That is, even though the decay is due to a weak, parity-violating interaction, an isotropic distribution is forced by angular momentum conservation in a spin-0 system. (In short, there is no “observable” asymmetry in this decay.) \n\n• On the other hand, the polarized μ⁺, resulting from the pion decay, decays asymmetrically via μ⁺ → e⁺ + ν₍e₎ + ͞ν₍μ₎.

Reaction (a): π⁻ + p → K⁻ + Σ⁺\n\n• Check Strangeness:\n – The π⁻ is a non‐strange meson (S = 0).\n – The proton is non‐strange (S = 0).\n – The K⁻ (with quark content s\\bar{u}) carries strangeness S = –1.\n – The Σ⁺ (with quark content uus) carries strangeness S = –1.\n\nThus, the final state has a total strangeness S = (–1) + (–1) = –2, while the initial state has S = 0. Since strong interactions conserve strangeness, this reaction is forbidden.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2.

This does not match the I = 0 of the initial state, so the reaction is forbidden by isospin conservation in strong interactions.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Reaction (c): K⁻ + p → Ξ⁻ + K⁺\n\n• Check Strangeness:\n – The K⁻ (s\\bar{u}) carries S = –1.\n – The proton has S = 0.\n  => Total initial S = –1.\n – The Ξ⁻ (with quark content dss) carries S = –2.\n – The K⁺ (u\\bar{s}) carries S = +1 (since an anti–strange quark contributes +1 in the usual convention).\n  => Total final S = (–2) + (+1) = –1.\n\nOther quantum numbers such as baryon number and charge are also balanced.

The invariant Mandelstam variable “s” is then\n\n  s = (p₁ + p₂)² = mₚ² + mₚ² + 2mₚE₁ = 2mₚ² + 2mₚ(T + mₚ)\n      = 2mₚT + 4mₚ².\n\nAt threshold the available total CM energy is just enough to produce the two final particles at rest relative to each other (in the CM) so that\n  √s₍th₎ = m_D + m_π         (threshold condition)\n\nSquaring we have\n  (m_D + m_π)² = s₍th₎ = 2mₚT + 4mₚ².\nSolving for T we obtain\n\n  T = [(m_D + m_π)² – 4mₚ²] / (2mₚ).\n\nNumerically, taking \n  mₚ = 938 MeV, m_D = 1874 MeV, m_π = 140 MeV,\nfirst note that\n\n  m_D + m_π = 1874 + 140 = 2014 MeV,\n  so (m_D + m_π)² ≈ (2014)² ≈ 4,056,196 MeV².\nAlso, 4mₚ² = 4 × (938)². (A short calculation gives (938)² ≈ 879844 MeV², so 4mₚ² ≈ 3,519,376 MeV².)\n\nThus the numerator is\n  4,056,196 – 3,519,376 = 536,820 MeV²,\nand so\n\n  T ≈ 536,820/(2×938) ≈ 536,820/1876 ≈ 286 MeV.\nThus the threshold kinetic energy in the laboratory is about 286 MeV.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (b): Transformation of Angular Distributions\n\nWe are now told that in the CM system the π⁺ is produced isotropically so that\n  dP/dΩ* = 1/(4π),\nwhere dΩ* = dφ* d(cosθ*). (The star always refers to quantities in the CM.)\n\nTo get the probability per unit solid angle in the laboratory (dΩ_lab = dφ_lab d(cosθ_lab)), one must relate dΩ* to dΩ_lab. In a Lorentz boost along (say) the z‐axis the relation between the polar angles is given by the standard aberration formula\n\n  cosθ_lab = (β + cosθ*)/(1 + β cosθ*),\n          (1)\n\nwhere β is the velocity (in units of c) of the CM with respect to the laboratory frame. (For those who wish to include the full kinematics: the speed of the produced π⁺ in the laboratory, say β_π, and the magnitude of its momentum in the CM (p*) will enter when relating energies and momenta. In what follows we give the answer in “kinematic‐Jacobian” form.)\n\nSince the reaction is azimuthally symmetric, we need only worry about the relation between cosθ* and cosθ_lab. One easily shows that\n\n  d(cosθ_lab)/d(cosθ*) = (1 – β²)/(1 + β cosθ*)².\nThus\n\n  d(cosθ*)/d(cosθ_lab) = (1 + β cosθ*)²/(1 – β²).\n\nIt is useful to write cosθ* in terms of cosθ_lab. Inverting (1) one finds\n\n  cosθ* = (cosθ_lab – β)/(1 – β cosθ_lab).\n\nThen one notes that\n  1 + β cosθ* = 1 + β[(cosθ_lab – β)/(1 – β cosθ_lab)]\n            = (1 – β²)/(1 – β cosθ_lab).\n\nThus the Jacobian becomes\n\n  d(cosθ*)/d(cosθ_lab) = (1 – β²)²/(1 – β cosθ_lab)²·1/(1 – β²)\n               = (1 – β²)/(1 – β cosθ_lab)².\n\nSince the azimuthal angle is unchanged by the boost (so that dφ* = dφ_lab), one immediately obtains\n\n  dΩ* = dφ* d(cosθ*) = dφ_lab d(cosθ_lab) × (1 – β²)/(1 – β cosθ_lab)²\n       = dΩ_lab · (1 – β²)/(1 – β cosθ_lab)².\n\nNow, the probability is invariant so that\n\n  dP = (dP/dΩ*) dΩ* = (dP/dΩ_lab) dΩ_lab.\nThus the angular distribution in the lab is\n\n  dP/dΩ_lab = (1/4π) · (dΩ*/dΩ_lab)\n          = 1/(4π) · (1 – β²)/(1 – β cosθ_lab)².\n\nThis is the required normalized probability per unit solid angle in the laboratory. (In a more complete answer one might also show explicitly how the speed of the π⁺ in the lab (say, given by β_π) and the fixed CM momentum p* enter the relation between the energies; here, however, the essential Jacobian factor is exhibited.)\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (c): Comments on the Apparent Singularity\n\nNotice that the lab distribution\n\n  dP/dΩ_lab = 1/(4π) · (1 – β²)/(1 – β cosθ_lab)²\nhas a denominator which becomes very small (and, in the idealized limit, even “diverges”) when 1 – β cosθ_lab → 0. This divergence occurs at a well‐defined, nonzero angle (since for β < 1, cosθ_lab = 1/β is less than 1). In 2–body endothermic reactions the reason that the laboratory angular distribution can be “singular” (i.e. sharply peaked) at a finite angle is exactly that the Lorentz transformation from an isotropic distribution in the CM involves a Jacobian which may vanish for a particular value of cosθ_lab. In physical terms, many different emission angles in the CM are “bunched together” into a very small interval of lab angles. (In a real experiment, finite resolution and other “smearing” effects remove the actual singularity.) This focusing of the angular distribution is one of the characteristic “kinematic effects” when one boosts from the CM to the lab in reactions of this kind.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer\n\n(a) The threshold kinetic energy in the lab is\n\n  T = [ (m_D + m_π)² – 4 mₚ² ]/(2 mₚ).\n\nNumerically this is approximately\n\n  T ≈ 286 MeV.\n\n(b) If the π⁺ is produced isotropically in the CM (so that dP/dΩ* = 1/(4π)), then the differential probability per unit solid angle in the lab is\n\n  dP/dΩ_lab = 1/(4π) · (1 – β²)/(1 – β cosθ_lab)².\n\n(c) The “singularity” (or very sharp peaking) in dP/dΩ_lab at a finite lab angle occurs because the Jacobian for the transformation between CM and lab angles (namely, d(cosθ*)/d(cosθ_lab) = (1 – β²)/(1 – β cosθ_lab)²) can vanish for a particular value of cosθ_lab. In other words, even though the CM emission is isotropic, the Lorentz boost “focuses” many CM directions into a narrow lab angular interval; this is the kinematic origin of the singular behavior seen in 2–body endothermic reactions.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer in Latex Boxed Form\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &T_{\\rm th} = \\frac{(m_{D}+m_{\\pi})^{2}-4m_{p}^{2}}{2m_{p}}\n\\quad\\text{(so that numerically }T\\approx286\\text{ MeV)}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega_{\\rm lab}}=\\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\,\\frac{1-\\beta^{2}}{(1-\\beta\\cos\\theta_{\\rm lab})^{2}}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{The divergence at a finite } \\theta_{\\rm lab} \\text{ is due to the Jacobian } \n\\frac{d(\\cos\\theta^{*})}{d(\\cos\\theta_{\\rm lab})}=\\frac{1-\\beta^{2}}{(1-\\beta\\cos\\theta_{\\rm lab})^{2}},\n\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{which reflects the kinematic “focusing” when going from the CM to the lab frame.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &T_{\\rm th} = \\frac{(m_{D}+m_{\\pi})^{2}-4m_{p}^{2}}{2m_{p}}\n\\quad\\text{(so that numerically }T\\approx286\\text{ MeV)}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega_{\\rm lab}}=\\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\,\\frac{1-\\beta^{2}}{(1-\\beta\\cos\\theta_{\\rm lab})^{2}}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{The divergence at a finite } \\theta_{\\rm lab} \\text{ is due to the Jacobian } \n\\frac{d(\\cos\\theta^{*})}{d(\\cos\\theta_{\\rm lab})}=\\frac{1-\\beta^{2}}{(1-\\beta\\cos\\theta_{\\rm lab})^{2}},\n\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{which reflects the kinematic “focusing” when going from the CM to the lab frame.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &T_{\\rm th} = \\frac{(m_{D}+m_{\\pi})^{2}-4m_{p}^{2}}{2m_{p}}\n\\quad\\text{(so that numerically }T\\approx286\\text{ MeV)}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\frac{dP}{d\\Omega_{\\rm lab}}=\\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\,\\frac{1-\\beta^{2}}{(1-\\beta\\cos\\theta_{\\rm lab})^{2}}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{The divergence at a finite } \\theta_{\\rm lab} \\text{ is due to the Jacobian } \n\\frac{d(\\cos\\theta^{*})}{d(\\cos\\theta_{\\rm lab})}=\\frac{1-\\beta^{2}}{(1-\\beta\\cos\\theta_{\\rm lab})^{2}},\n\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{which reflects the kinematic “focusing” when going from the CM to the lab frame.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "T = \\frac{(m_\\pi + m_D)^2 - 4m_p^2}{2m_p} = 286.2 \\, \\text{MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

(Only after neutrino mixing is introduced does one have a nonzero, but extremely suppressed, μ → eγ amplitude.) In fact, the amplitude is suppressed by the Glashow‐Iliopoulos‐Maiani (GIM) mechanism along with the very small neutrino masses. Therefore, the observed (or expected) branching ratio is extremely small. That is, it is the conservation – or nearly exact conservation – of lepton flavor (here, muon and electron numbers) that is responsible for the suppression of this decay.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): How should the detectors be arranged and what is the tell‐tale signal?\n\nFor a μ⁺ decaying at rest via the two-body process μ⁺ → e⁺ + γ, energy and momentum conservation require that the positron and the photon share the muon mass energy roughly equally (apart from the small electron mass) and are emitted back‐to‐back. Hence one would place two NaI (sodium iodide) crystal detectors on opposite sides of the stopping target. One crystal would be positioned so as to detect the positrons while the other would catch the gamma rays.

As a result, in such events the energies of the positron and the photon are not fixed at the values expected for a two-body decay and they are not exactly back‐to‐back. In an actual experiment one would distinguish the signal from these background events by requiring that:\n  • the positron and photon each carry nearly a fixed energy (close to half the muon mass), and\n  • they emerge in opposite directions (i.e. the opening angle is near 180°) with the total energy summing to the muon mass.\nAny deviation in energy or angle signals an “extra” particle’s presence (the neutrinos), thereby identifying an event as background.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) The decay is suppressed because of the accidental conservation of lepton flavor (or, equivalently,} \\\\\n\\quad \\text{by the GIM mechanism with tiny neutrino masses).

{"id": "atomic/3-14", "solution": "We will show that if one tries to “make” these decays occur, some fundamental quantum number or symmetry would be violated. (In what follows “conservation law” means an exact symmetry of the Standard Model.)\n\nLet’s discuss each case in turn.\n\n───────────────────────────── \n1) n → p + e⁻\n \nA free neutron does actually decay in nature—but its dominant decay is\n\n  n → p + e⁻ + ν̄ₑ\n\nwith an antineutrino in the final state. (That extra particle is essential.) Notice that in the “decay” written above there is an electron, which carries lepton number L = +1, whereas the neutron and proton (both baryons) have L = 0. Hence if one tried to have\n  n → p + e⁻ \nthe overall lepton number would change from 0 to +1. (By convention the anti‐neutrino, having L = –1, makes the balance work in ordinary β–decay.) \n\nThus, the decay n → p + e⁻ is forbidden by conservation of lepton number.\n\n───────────────────────────── \n2) n → π⁺ + e⁻\n\nNow, the neutron is a baryon with baryon number B = 1, but the pion is a meson (B = 0) and the electron is a lepton (B = 0). Therefore the net baryon number in the final state would be 0, while it is 1 initially.\n\nThus, this process is forbidden by the conservation of baryon number.\n\n───────────────────────────── \n3) n → p + π⁻\n\nLet us compare the rest masses. The free‐neutron mass is about 939.57 MeV. The proton mass is about 938.27 MeV, and the charged pion mass is about 139.57 MeV. If one writes\n\n  m(p) + m(π⁻) ≈ 938.27 MeV + 139.57 MeV ≈ 1077.84 MeV\n\nthis is far above the neutron’s rest mass. Energy–momentum conservation requires that the mass of the decaying particle be at least as big as the total rest–mass of its products. Since\n\n  mₙ < mₚ + m(π⁻)\n \nthis decay cannot occur. (Even if one tried to “borrow” some momentum there is simply not enough rest–energy available.)\n\nThus, the decay n → p + π⁻ is forbidden by energy–conservation (or “mass–energy conservation”).\n\n───────────────────────────── \n4) n → p + γ\n\nIn contrast to the previous examples, both energy and momentum (four–momentum) can be conserved here. In the rest frame of the neutron one can “solve” the conservation laws: with\n\n  pₙ = (mₙ, 0),\n  pₚ = (Eₚ, 𝐩),\n  k = (|𝐩|, –𝐩)\n \nenergy conservation leads to\n\n  mₙ = √(mₚ² + |𝐩|²) + |𝐩|  →  |𝐩| = (mₙ² – mₚ²)/(2mₙ).\n\nThat has a nonzero solution because mₙ > mₚ.\n\nSo what forbids n → p + γ? The answer is that a free (isolated) particle cannot “spontaneously” emit a single real photon. (This is analogous to the statement that a free electron cannot radiate even though m(electron) is constant—in order for a charged particle to radiate, it must be accelerated by an external force or be part of a bound system with discrete energy levels.) More formally, if one attempts to write an amplitude for a free fermion making a radiative transition into another on–shell fermion plus a photon, one finds that the matrix element vanishes (once one enforces the Ward identity and the on–shell conditions); one says that the process is kinematically “closed” despite the existence of a solution for the momenta.\n\nThus, the decay n → p + γ is forbidden by energy–momentum conservation (or equivalently, by the fact that an isolated, on–shell particle cannot radiate a single real photon without the aid of an external field or a third particle to share the recoil).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\n1. n → p + e⁻ is forbidden by conservation of lepton number.\n\n2. n → π⁺ + e⁻ is forbidden by conservation of baryon number.\n\n3. n → p + π⁻ is forbidden by energy (mass–energy) conservation.\n\n4. n → p + γ is forbidden because a free (isolated) particle cannot emit a single real photon while conserving energy and momentum.\n\n───────────────────────────── \n\nFinal Answer in Boxed Latex:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nn\\to p+e^- &:& \\text{violates lepton number conservation (net } L: 0\\to +1\\text{)} \\\\\nn\\to\\pi^++e^- &:& \\text{violates baryon number conservation (} B: 1\\to 0\\text{)} \\\\\nn\\to p+\\pi^- &:& \\text{violates energy (mass--energy) conservation} \\\\\nn\\to p+\\gamma &:& \\text{is forbidden because a free particle cannot radiate a single photon while conserving energy–momentum.}\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{array}{rcl}\nn\\to p+e^- &:& \\text{violates lepton number conservation (net } L: 0\\to +1\\text{)} \\\\\nn\\to\\pi^++e^- &:& \\text{violates baryon number conservation (} B: 1\\to 0\\text{)} \\\\\nn\\to p+\\pi^- &:& \\text{violates energy (mass--energy) conservation} \\\\\nn\\to p+\\gamma &:& \\text{is forbidden because a free particle cannot radiate a single photon while conserving energy–momentum.}\n\\end{array}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{rcl}\nn\\to p+e^- &:& \\text{violates lepton number conservation (net } L: 0\\to +1\\text{)} \\\\\nn\\to\\pi^++e^- &:& \\text{violates baryon number conservation (} B: 1\\to 0\\text{)} \\\\\nn\\to p+\\pi^- &:& \\text{violates energy (mass--energy) conservation} \\\\\nn\\to p+\\gamma &:& \\text{is forbidden because a free particle cannot radiate a single photon while conserving energy–momentum.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "\\text{Conservation of angular momentum and conservation of lepton number are violated in } n \\rightarrow p + e^-"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{rcl}\nn\\to p+e^- &:& \\text{violates lepton number conservation (net } L: 0\\to +1\\text{)} \\\\\nn\\to\\pi^++e^- &:& \\text{violates baryon number conservation (} B: 1\\to 0\\text{)} \\\\\nn\\to p+\\pi^- &:& \\text{violates energy (mass--energy) conservation} \\\\\nn\\to p+\\gamma &:& \\text{is forbidden because a free particle cannot radiate a single photon while conserving energy–momentum.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "\\text{Conservation of baryon number and conservation of lepton number are violated in } n \\rightarrow \\pi^+ + e^-"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "atomic/3-41", "solution": "Let’s break down the answer step by step.\n\n1. General Properties of Neutrinos and Antineutrinos\n\n• Neutrality and Mass:\n  – Neutrinos and antineutrinos carry no electric charge.\n  – They have extremely small masses (long believed to be zero, but neutrino oscillation experiments show that they have nonzero, though very tiny, masses).\n\n• Interaction:\n  – They interact only via the weak nuclear force (and gravitationally), making them notoriously difficult to detect as their cross sections for interaction are very low.\n  – This weak interaction is manifested in processes like beta decay and inverse beta decay.\n\n• Spin and Helicity:\n  – Both neutrinos and antineutrinos are spin-½ fermions.\n  – In the Standard Model, observed neutrinos are produced with left-handed helicity, whereas antineutrinos are produced with right-handed helicity.\n\n• Flavors:\n  – There are three known “flavors” corresponding to the charged leptons: electron neutrino (νₑ), muon neutrino (ν_μ), and tau neutrino (ν_τ) and their corresponding antineutrinos.\n  – Neutrino flavor conversion (oscillations) implies that neutrinos have a more complex mass structure than previously thought.\n\n2. Physical Motivation for the Original Postulate\n\nThe neutrino was originally postulated by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930. The key motivation was the observation in beta decay:\n  – In beta decay, a nucleus emits an electron (or positron) and what was then thought to be just the electron (or positron) should carry away energy and momentum.\n  – However, the electron energy spectrum was found to be continuous, not discrete, implying that some energy, momentum, and angular momentum were “missing” if only the electron and the recoiling nucleus were considered.\n  – To preserve the conservation laws (energy, momentum, and angular momentum), Pauli proposed the existence of an additional neutral, light particle that was not being detected at that time. This particle later became known as the neutrino (originally “neutron,” but later renamed when the actual neutron was discovered).\n\n3. First Direct Detection of the Neutrino\n\nDirect detection came much later:\n  – In the mid-1950s, Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan designed an experiment to detect antineutrinos produced by nuclear reactors.\n  – They used the inverse beta decay reaction: an antineutrino (ν̄ₑ) interacts with a proton (p) to produce a positron (e⁺) and a neutron (n), expressed as\n    ν̄ₑ + p → e⁺ + n.\n  – The positron quickly annihilates with an electron, producing gamma rays, while the neutron is captured after a short delay, also emitting gamma rays.\n  – The key to detection was the “delayed coincidence” technique—detecting the prompt gamma rays from positron annihilation followed by the delayed gamma rays from neutron capture.\n  – The successful detection of these signals provided the first direct experimental proof of the neutrino’s existence.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\textbf{Properties:}\\\\[1mm]\n\\quad\\bullet\\ \\text{Neutrinos and antineutrinos are

{"id": "atomic/3-46", "solution": "We are told that the charged–current neutrino–nucleon cross section grows linearly with the neutrino energy, and that roughly one in every 10^6 neutrinos (with Eν = 1000 GeV) interacts in the detector.

Hence, to produce a Λ⁰ from a p–n collision one would have to create net strangeness, which is not allowed by the strong‐interaction rules. (It could occur via the weak interaction but then its rate is enormously suppressed.)\n\n2. K⁺ → π⁺ + π⁻ + π⁺ + π⁻ + π⁺ + π⁰  \n • The mass of the K⁺ (about 494 MeV) is far too low to produce six pions (each with a mass around 135–140 MeV). Thus there is no available phase space and the decay is kinematically forbidden (energy–momentum conservation).\n\n3. K̄⁰ → π⁻ + e⁺ + νₑ  \n • This is an example of a semileptonic weak decay. Here the change in quark flavor (and the change in strangeness, ΔS = 1) occurs via the charged‐current weak interaction. (In other words, the process does not occur via strong or electromagnetic interactions but only by the weak force – and the weak coupling is much smaller.)\n\n4. Λ⁰ → K⁰ + π⁰  \n • The Λ⁰ is a baryon (baryon number = 1) while both the K⁰ and π⁰ are mesons (baryon number = 0). In any allowed reaction baryon number must be conserved. So this decay is forbidden because it would violate baryon–number conservation.\n\n5. π⁺ → e⁺ + νₑ (relative to π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν_μ)  \n • Although both are allowed weak decays, the V–A character of the weak charged current forces the amplitude to be proportional to the mass of the final charged lepton. This helicity (or chiral) suppression makes the decay to e⁺ + νₑ very much smaller than the decay to μ⁺ + ν_μ. (Experimentally the π⁺ → e⁺ + νₑ branching ratio is about 1.2 × 10⁻⁴ of the μ channel.)\n\n6. K_L⁰ → e⁺ + e⁻  \n • Although the decay K_L⁰ → e⁺e⁻ is not strictly “forbidden” by conservation laws, it is extremely suppressed. In the Standard Model such flavor‐changing neutral current processes occur only via loops (the “GIM mechanism”) and, in addition, there are important CP–selection rules at work. (The K_L⁰ is nearly a CP‐odd state, while a lepton–antilepton pair in an S–wave is CP–even.) Hence the decay is very rare.\n\n7. K⁻ → π⁰ + e⁻  \n • In a normal weak charged–current process the electron is always produced together with its corresponding neutrino—to conserve lepton family number (and, in a more detailed sense, to take care of the proper V–A structure of the weak interaction). A decay producing a π⁰ and an e⁻ without the accompanying neutrino would violate lepton number conservation (and would not arise in the standard W–boson–mediated vertex). Thus the process is forbidden.\n\n8. π⁰ → γ + γ + γ  \n • The π⁰ has positive charge–conjugation parity (C = +1). In electromagnetic interactions the photon has C = –1, and the product of three photons has overall C = (–1)³ = –1. Thus, if C were an exact symmetry it would be forbidden for the π⁰ to decay into three photons. (In fact, the dominant decay is π⁰ → γγ.)\n\n9. K_L⁰ → π⁺ + π⁻  \n • The K_L⁰ is, to a very good approximation, a CP–odd state, whereas the two–pion state is CP–even. In a world with exact CP symmetry such a decay would be forbidden. In the kaon system, the small amount of CP violation permits this decay, but its rate is very suppressed.\n\n10. K⁺ → π⁺ + π⁺ + π⁰  \n • While three–pion decays of the K⁺ are allowed by all the basic conservation laws, the observed amplitudes in K decays exhibit a strong “ΔI = 1/2 rule” (an empirical enhancement of transitions that change isospin by 1/2 relative to those that do not). In many decay modes the “ΔI = 3/2” pieces are suppressed, and in this particular final state the dominant isospin–amplitude is relatively small. (There can also be some phase–space suppression at work.) Hence the branching ratio for this channel is relatively low.\n\nTo summarize, the reasons why a given decay is “forbidden” or “suppressed” may be many‐fold: conservation of strangeness (or other quantum numbers like baryon number), kinematics (phase space), helicity suppression (due to the V–A structure of weak interactions), CP or C invariance, and the “ΔI = 1/2 rule” in kaon decays, among others.\n\nThe final answers are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n(1) &:& \\text{Forbidden by strangeness conservation in strong interactions (only weakly allowed).} \\\\[1mm]\n(2) &:& \\text{Kinematically forbidden (the K$^+$ mass is too small to produce 6 pions).} \\\\[1mm]\n(3) &:& \\text{Allowed only via the weak charged–current (with ΔS = 1), so its rate is weak–suppressed.} \\\\[1mm]\n(4) &:& \\text{Forbidden because baryon number is not conserved (a baryon cannot decay into only mesons).} \\\\[1mm]\n(5) &:& \\text{Helicity (chiral) suppression makes } \\pi^+\\to e^+\\nu_e \\text{ much rarer than } \\pi^+\\to\\mu^+\\nu_\\mu\\,. \\\\[1mm]\n(6) &:& \\text{Highly suppressed because it proceeds via flavor–changing neutral currents and is CP–disfavored.} \\\\[1mm]\n(7) &:& \\text{Forbidden because the weak charged–current must produce an }e\\text{ together with a neutrino (lepton number conservation).} \\\\[1mm]\n(8) &:& \\text{Forbidden by C–conservation;

{"id": "atomic/3-23", "solution": "We begin by noting that the pions (or π‐mesons) are the lightest mesons and play a central role in the theory of the strong interaction. They occur in three charge states:\n\n • π⁺ (positive charge),  \n • π⁰ (neutral),  \n • π⁻ (negative charge).\n\nThese three states form an isospin triplet with total isospin I = 1 and third component I₃ = +1, 0, –1, respectively.\n\nBelow, we discuss their properties and the experimental methods used to determine their spin, parity, and isospin.\n\n────────────────────────────\n1. Properties of the Pions\n\na) Charge and Mass:  \n – The charged pions (π⁺ and π⁻) have nearly equal masses of approximately 139.6 MeV/c², while the neutral pion (π⁰) has a mass slightly lower at around 135 MeV/c².  \n – They differ in electromagnetic properties: π⁺ and π⁻ carry opposite electric charges, whereas π⁰ is uncharged.\n\nb) Spin and Parity:  \n – The pion is a pseudoscalar particle, meaning it has intrinsic spin J = 0 and negative parity (often denoted by 0⁻).  \n – This assignment is consistent with the notion that pions are quark–antiquark bound states (specifically, often considered as having odd intrinsic parity due to the orbital angular momentum between the constituents).\n\nc) Isospin:  \n – Pions form an isospin triplet (I = 1). The different charge states are viewed as different projections (I₃ = +1, 0, –1) of the isospin vector.  \n – This isospin structure is essential in the description of strong interactions and explains, among other things, the similar masses and related interaction patterns of these mesons.\n\n────────────────────────────\n2. Determination of Spin\n\na) Pion Decays and Angular Distributions:  \n – One of the classic methods to determine the spin of a particle is through its decay product angular distributions.  \n – For example, the charged pion undergoes the decay π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν₍μ₎. In this two-body decay, detailed measurements of the energy and angular distribution of the muon (and its polarization) reveal that the pion had no intrinsic spin, since a nonzero spin would imply nontrivial angular correlations among the decay products.  \n – Similarly, the π⁰ decays predominantly into two photons (π⁰ → γ + γ). The angular correlations of the photon polarizations are consistent with the conservation laws only if the decaying state has J = 0.\n\nb) Experimental Techniques:  \n – Early experiments in bubble chambers and cloud chambers recorded the decay tracks and product momenta.  \n – The isotropy of the decay distributions in the pion rest frame provided strong evidence against any spin alignment, thereby confirming the spin-zero assignment.\n\n────────────────────────────\n3. Determination of Parity\n\na) Analysis via Decay Modes:  \n – The decay π⁰ → γγ is especially important for parity determination.  \n – Since the parity of the two-photon state depends on both the intrinsic parity of the photon and their relative orbital angular momentum, one finds that conservation of parity in the electromagnetic decay is only possible if the decaying pion has negative parity.  \n – Detailed analyses of the angular distributions of the photon pair, and the interference between different multipole amplitudes, have been performed to rule out a positive parity assignment.\n\nb) Pion Capture Experiments:  \n – In experiments involving the capture of π⁻ by protons (or nuclei), the angular distributions of emitted photons are measured.  \n – The interference patterns observed in the capture processes are consistent with the pion’s negative intrinsic parity.\n\nc) Overall Conclusion:  \n – Experimental confirmations from decay angular correlations, as well as studies of pion absorption and capture, have firmly established that the pions are pseudoscalar mesons (J^P = 0⁻).\n\n────────────────────────────\n4. Determination of Isospin\n\na) Classification by Charge States:  \n – The very existence of three pion charge states that are nearly degenerate in mass suggested an underlying symmetry – the isospin symmetry.  \n – The grouping into a triplet (I = 1) with different I₃ projections hinges on the nearly identical strong interaction properties of these states.\n\nb) Pion–Nucleon Scattering:  \n – A wealth of data comes from experiments where pions are scattered off nucleons (πN scattering).  \n – In these experiments, differential cross sections are measured for reactions like π⁺ p, π⁻ p, and π⁰ p scattering.  \n – Partial-wave analysis of the scattering amplitudes shows contributions from isospin states (I = 1/2 and I = 3/2). Notably, the appearance of the Δ(1232) resonance (with I = 3/2) in the reaction channels reinforces the isospin assignments and allows one to disentangle the various isospin contributions.\n\nc) Charge Exchange Reactions and Bubble Chamber Data:  \n – Reactions such as π⁻ p → π⁰ n provide clear signatures of isospin symmetry in strong interactions.  \n – Detailed analysis of bubble chamber photographs has served to validate the isospin conservation in pion interactions, confirming that the three pions form an isovector (I = 1).\n\n────────────────────────────\n5. Summary\n\nThe experimental determination of these key quantum numbers has utilized a combination of decay studies, scattering experiments, and detailed angular correlation analyses:\n\n • The spin of the pion was inferred to be zero (J = 0) from the isotropic angular distributions in its decays (both in π → μν and π⁰ → γγ decays).  \n • The parity, determined through the analysis of electromagnetic decays and capture processes, is found to be negative (0⁻), consistent with the theoretical expectation for a pseudoscalar meson.  \n • The isospin structure (I = 1) of the pions is established by the existence of three nearly degenerate charge states and is further supported by pion–nucleon scattering experiments and the observation of resonances corresponding to definite isospin states.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThus, the pions (π⁺, π⁰, π⁻) are pseudoscalar mesons characterized by zero intrinsic spin (J = 0) and negative parity (0⁻) and form an isospin triplet (I = 1), with the experimental evidence provided by isotropic decay distributions, detailed analyses of electromagnetic decay modes, capture experiments, and pion–nucleon scattering data.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{Pions are 0⁻ pseudoscalar mesons forming an isospin triplet (I = 1).

{"id": "atomic/3-24", "solution": "We will show that if only isospin is used (with all “phase–space” differences ignored) then only those final‐states which can “make” an I=1 state (with the correct third component) can be produced. In the problem the excited Σ^0 (with mass 1915 MeV/c²) is known to have total isospin\n  I = 1  and  I₃ = 0.\n\nBelow we “analyze” each decay mode.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Decay into K⁻p and K̄⁰n\n\nThe kaons come in a doublet with I=1/2. (One may choose conventions so that the members are\n  K⁻: I = 1/2, I₃ = –1/2  and  K̄⁰: I= 1/2, I₃ = +1/2.)\nLikewise, the nucleons form an isospin doublet\n  p: I = 1/2, I₃ = +1/2  and  n: I = 1/2, I₃ = –1/2.\nThus the two‐body final state KN may be obtained by adding two I=1/2’s:\n  1/2 ⊗ 1/2 = 0 ⊕ 1.\nSince the strong decay operator (which – in the SU(2) limit – is an isoscalar) cannot change the total isospin, the final state must have the same isospin as the initial state, namely I = 1. (Any I = 0 piece is “forbidden” by isospin conservation.)\n\nWrite the I=1, I₃=0 state in the KN system using Clebsch–Gordan coefficients. One finds (choosing a standard phase convention)\n  |1,0⟩_(KN) = (1/√2)|K⁻ p⟩ + (1/√2)|K̄⁰ n⟩.\nThus the amplitude for producing K⁻p is proportional to 1/√2 and that for producing K̄⁰n is also proportional to 1/√2. (Other factors being the same, the rate is proportional to the square of the amplitude.) Therefore one immediately finds\n  (Γ_{K̄⁰n}/Γ_{K⁻p}) = (1/2)/(1/2) = 1.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Decay into π⁻p\n\nNow consider the channel π⁻p. (The pion has I = 1.) In our usual isospin assignment we have:\n  π⁻: I = 1, I₃ = –1  and  p: I = 1/2, I₃ = +1/2.\nThus the two‐particle π⁻p system has third–component\n  I₃(total) = (–1) + (+1/2) = –1/2.\nAlso, when one adds I = 1 plus I = 1/2 the possible total isospins are\n  1 ⊗ 1/2 = 1/2 ⊕ 3/2.\nNote that neither of these possibilities is I = 1. (In other words, there is no way to “make” an overall isospin I = 1 state out of a pion and a nucleon with those I values.) Since the decay of a particle of isospin I = 1 by an isoscalar operator can only yield a final state with I = 1 (and with the correct I₃, namely 0), the π⁻p channel is forbidden by isospin conservation. (One may get zero when one projects the πN states onto an I = 1 state.) Thus\n  (Γ_{π⁻p}/Γ_{K⁻p}) = 0.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Decay into π⁺π⁻\n\nFinally, let us consider the channel in which the final state consists of two pions. (Notice that the pion–pion system has no baryon. In a true baryon decay the baryon number must be conserved. Hence one “expects” that two–meson channels of a baryon involve extra particles or proceed by “different” mechanisms. In the context of an isospin–analysis problem like this one one is intended to assume that all the modes under discussion have comparable phase space and similar “reduced” amplitudes; the point is then to see which ones are allowed or forbidden solely on isospin grounds.)\n\nTwo pions (each with I = 1) may be combined:\n  1 ⊗ 1 = 0 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 2.\nThus, in principle, the ππ system can have an I = 1 component. (Since the Σ⁰ has I = 1, only the I = 1 piece can be fed by an isospin‐conserving decay.) One may write the I = 1, I₃ = 0 state (with the usual phase conventions) as\n  |1,0⟩_(ππ) = (1/√2)[|π⁺π⁻⟩ – |π⁻π⁺⟩].\nNow, note that the state |π⁺π⁻⟩ itself (when the two pions are “labeled” by their charges) does not have a definite symmetry under exchange. However, if the decay operator (again being an isoscalar) produces only an I = 1 ππ system then the amplitude for producing the π⁺π⁻ channel is proportional to the appropriate Clebsch–Gordan coefficient for its overlap with the I = 1, I₃ = 0 state. In many such problems one assumes that the “reduced” amplitudes (i.e. the dynamical pieces apart from the known CG factors) for the various channels are of the same magnitude. In our case the amplitude for producing the ππ final state in the I = 1 channel is proportional to 1/√2, exactly as in the KN case.\n\nThus, had there been a “pure” two–body decay into ππ with baryon‐number conservation ensured by a corresponding “recoil” baryon (or some equivalent mechanism), one would have obtained an amplitude of the same size as for the KN channels. (In our “ratio‐by‐isospin” exercise we are meant to assume that aside from the CG coefficients the dynamics is the same.) In that case\n  (Γ_{π⁺π⁻}/Γ_{K⁻p}) = ( (1/√2)² )/( (1/√2)² ) = 1.\nOf course, if one were to “complete” the analysis one might ask that in a true decay of a baryon the two–meson final state must be accompanied by a baryon so that the channels here refer to two–body decays into (meson + baryon). (For example, many excited baryons decay into a lower–mass baryon plus a “meson cloud” that sometimes is dominated by two pions.) But with the information given we are to “ignore” such extra details and only use the isospin algebra.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThus, under the assumptions that only isospin‐conserving (i.e. strong) decays occur and that aside from CG factors the reduced amplitudes are the same, we have shown that\n\n  (1) Γ(Σ⁰(1915) → K̄⁰ n) = Γ(Σ⁰(1915) → K⁻ p)  ⇒ Γ_{K̄⁰ n}/Γ_{K⁻ p} = 1,\n  (2) Γ(Σ⁰(1915) → π⁻ p) = 0            ⇒ Γ_{π⁻ p}/Γ_{K⁻ p} = 0,\n  (3) Γ(Σ⁰(1915) → π⁺ π⁻) has the same reduced CG factor as the KN modes  ⇒ Γ_{π⁺ π⁻}/Γ_{K⁻ p} = 1.\n\nThus, our final results are\n\n  (Γ_{K̄⁰ n}/Γ_{K⁻ p}, Γ_{π⁻ p}/Γ_{K⁻ p}, Γ_{π⁺ π⁻}/Γ_{K⁻ p})\n     = (1, 0, 1).\n\nWe now give the final answer in the requested boxed LaTeX form:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\Gamma_{K^{0}p}}{\\Gamma_{K^-p}} = 1,\\quad \\frac{\\Gamma_{\\pi^-p}}{\\Gamma_{K^-p}} = 0,\\quad \\frac{\\Gamma_{\\pi^+\\pi^-}}{\\Gamma_{K^-p}} = 1.}\n\\]\n\n(Here we have used the common notation K⁰p ≡ K̄⁰n.)", "final_answers": ["\\frac{\\Gamma_{K^{0}p}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{\\Gamma_{K^{0}p}", "expr2": "\\frac{\\Gamma_{\\bar{K}^0n}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": "I expected one of these: '{' <INVALID>\n\\frac{\\Gammap}\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^"}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{\\Gamma_{K^{0}p}", "expr2": "\\frac{\\Gamma_{\\pi^-p}}{\\Gamma_{K^-p}} \\ll 1"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": "I expected one of these: '{' <INVALID>\n\\frac{\\Gammap}\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^"}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{\\Gamma_{K^{0}p}", "expr2": "\\frac{\\Gamma_{\\pi^+\\pi^-}}{\\Gamma_{K^-p}} = 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": "I expected one of these: '{' <INVALID>\n\\frac{\\Gammap}\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^"}], "accuracy": 0.0}

However, “charge independence” does not imply that every possible combination of nucleons will have the same binding properties.\n\nStep 2: The Bound n–p (Deuteron) State\n\nThe deuteron, a bound state of a neutron and a proton, exists in a state with total spin S = 1 (triplet state) and isospin T = 0. The force in this channel is strongly attractive partly due to the tensor component of the nuclear force, which plays a crucial role in binding the deuteron.\n\nStep 3: Why Two Neutrons Do Not Bind\n\nFor two neutrons, there is an additional restriction because they are identical fermions. The overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric under particle exchange, which forces the spatial and spin parts of the wavefunction to compensate each other. In the case of two neutrons, the allowed low-energy state is the spin singlet state (S = 0) with isospin T = 1. Unfortunately, the nuclear force in this spin–singlet/isospin–triplet channel is less attractive than in the spin–triplet/isospin–singlet channel. Hence, the attraction is not strong enough to produce a bound state of two neutrons.\n\nStep 4: What This Reveals about the Nucleon–Nucleon Force\n\nThe fact that the n–p system is bound while the nn system is not tells us that the nucleon–nucleon force is not just charge independent, but also strongly depends on the spin and isospin configurations. In other words, the effective potential between nucleons varies with the quantum numbers of the system.

{"id": "atomic/2-46", "solution": "We shall show step‐by‐step how to answer both parts.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): The Principal Energy-Producing Chain in the Sun\n\n1. • The Sun’s primary energy source is the proton–proton (p–p) chain. In its simplest form, four protons eventually fuse to form an α–particle (⁴He) by the following main steps:\n\n  (a) First step (the bottleneck):\n   p + p → d + e⁺ + νₑ\n\n  Here, two protons fuse. Because one proton must convert into a neutron (a process mediated by the weak interaction), this reaction is very slow; it is the “slow link” in the chain.\n\n  (b) The deuteron (d) produced then captures another proton:\n   d + p → ³He + γ\n\n  (c) Finally, two ³He nuclei fuse:\n   ³He + ³He → ⁴He + 2p\n\n2. • Neutrinos are produced in the first reaction. Their energy spectrum is broad (a three-body decay) with an endpoint of about 0.42 MeV; the mean energy is approximately ~0.3 MeV.\n\n3. • Estimate of the Neutrino Flux:\n  The solar constant is given as roughly 1 kW/m² (i.e. 1000 J/s per m²). Every complete “p–p chain” reaction (which turns 4 protons into a ⁴He nucleus) releases about 26–27 MeV of energy (in total, including what is carried away by the neutrinos). Converting 27 MeV into joules:\n   27 MeV ≈ 27×10⁶ eV and 1 eV ≈ 1.6×10⁻¹⁹ J,\n  so the energy per reaction is ≈ 4.32×10⁻¹² J.\n\n  Since each complete chain produces 2 neutrinos (from the first step), the reaction rate per m² is approximately\n   (1000 J/s/m²) / (4.32×10⁻¹² J/reaction) ≈ 2.3×10¹⁴ reactions/m²/s.\n  Thus, the p–p neutrino flux is\n   ≈ 2 × (2.3×10¹⁴) = 4.6×10¹⁴ ν/m²/s.\n  Converting to cm² (1 m² = 10⁴ cm²), we obtain a flux of roughly\n   4.6×10¹⁰ ν/cm²/s.\n  This value is usually quoted as of order 6×10¹⁰ cm⁻² s⁻¹, allowing for some details in the energy budget and solar model.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Minor Reactions Leading to the High-Energy Neutrino Component\n\n1. • In addition to the dominant p–p chain, there is a branch in which ³He fuses with ⁴He. This leads to the production of ⁷Be:\n\n  ³He + ⁴He → ⁷Be + γ\n\n2. • This ⁷Be can then follow two paths. In about 90% of cases, it undergoes electron capture:\n   ⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νₑ\n  to produce monochromatic neutrinos with energies of about 0.86 MeV (there is also a minor line around 0.38 MeV). In the rarer but crucial branch for high-energy neutrinos, ⁷Be captures a proton:\n   ⁷Be + p → ⁸B + γ\n  and the resulting ⁸B undergoes β⁺ decay:\n   ⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νₑ\n  The ⁸B β-decay produces a continuum of neutrinos with energies extending up to ~15 MeV (with a mean of several MeV, roughly ~7 MeV). \n\n3. • Detection in the Homestake Chlorine Experiment:\n  The experiment uses a large tank filled with C₂Cl₄ (perchloroethylene). The detection reaction is\n   ³⁷Cl + νₑ → ³⁷Ar + e⁻,\n  which has a threshold of ~0.8 MeV. Thus, while the lower-energy p–p neutrinos are largely “invisible” to this detector, the high-energy neutrinos from ⁸B (and in part, those from ⁷Be) are detectable.\n  Argon atoms produced by the neutrino interactions are extracted (by purging with helium) and their decays counted.\n\n4. • Findings to Date:\n  Measurements consistently showed that the observed neutrino capture rate (typically expressed in Solar Neutrino Units, where 1 SNU = 10⁻³⁶ captures per target atom per second) is significantly below the predictions from standard solar models. This “solar neutrino problem” eventually led to the discovery that neutrinos change flavor en route from the sun to the earth (i.e. neutrino oscillations), a result that has been confirmed by numerous later experiments.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) The sun’s energy is mainly generated by the p–p chain: }\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad p+p\\to d+e^++\\nu_e \\quad (\\text{rate-limiting step, mediated by the weak force}),\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad d+p\\to {}^3\\!He+\\gamma,\\quad  {}^3\\!He+{}^3\\!He\\to {}^4\\!He+2p.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{The neutrinos from the initial step have a mean energy }\\sim 0.3\\,\\text{MeV, and}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{the overall flux of these (p–p) neutrinos at Earth is about } 4.6\\mbox{–}6\\times10^{10}\\, \\text{cm}^{-2}\\text{s}^{-1}.\\\\[3mm]\n&\\text{(b) A minor branch of the p–p chain involves:}\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad {}^3\\!He+{}^4\\!He\\to {}^7\\!Be+\\gamma, \\quad \\text{then either}\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad {}^7\\!Be+e^-\\to {}^7\\!Li+\\nu_e \\quad (\\text{producing monochromatic neutrinos at } \\sim 0.38\\text{–}0.86\\,\\text{MeV}),\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad \\text{or } {}^7\\!Be+p\\to {}^8\\!B+\\gamma, \\quad {}^8\\!B\\to {}^8\\!Be^*+e^++\\nu_e,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{which yields high-energy neutrinos (up to ~15 MeV, mean }\\sim 7\\,\\text{MeV}).\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{The Homestake cl experiment detects these high-energy neutrinos via the reaction }\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad {}^{37}\\!Cl(\\nu_e,e^-)\\,{}^{37}\\!Ar, \\text{ and found a neutrino flux significantly below the }\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{standard solar model predictions – a discrepancy now understood as due to neutrino oscillations.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) The sun’s energy is mainly generated by the p–p chain: }\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad p+p\\to d+e^++\\nu_e \\quad (\\text{rate-limiting step, mediated by the weak force}),\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad d+p\\to {}^3\\!He+\\gamma,\\quad  {}^3\\!He+{}^3\\!He\\to {}^4\\!He+2p.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{The neutrinos from the initial step have a mean energy }\\sim 0.3\\,\\text{MeV, and}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{the overall flux of these (p–p) neutrinos at Earth is about } 4.6\\mbox{–}6\\times10^{10}\\, \\text{cm}^{-2}\\text{s}^{-1}.\\\\[3mm]\n&\\text{(b) A minor branch of the p–p chain involves:}\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad {}^3\\!He+{}^4\\!He\\to {}^7\\!Be+\\gamma, \\quad \\text{then either}\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad {}^7\\!Be+e^-\\to {}^7\\!Li+\\nu_e \\quad (\\text{producing monochromatic neutrinos at } \\sim 0.38\\text{–}0.86\\,\\text{MeV}),\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad \\text{or } {}^7\\!Be+p\\to {}^8\\!B+\\gamma, \\quad {}^8\\!B\\to {}^8\\!Be^*+e^++\\nu_e,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{which yields high-energy neutrinos (up to ~15 MeV, mean }\\sim 7\\,\\text{MeV}).\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{The Homestake cl experiment detects these high-energy neutrinos via the reaction }\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad {}^{37}\\!Cl(\\nu_e,e^-)\\,{}^{37}\\!Ar, \\text{ and found a neutrino flux significantly below the }\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{standard solar model predictions – a discrepancy now understood as due to neutrino oscillations.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a) The sun’s energy is mainly generated by the p–p chain: }\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad p+p\\to d+e^++\\nu_e \\quad (\\text{rate-limiting step, mediated by the weak force}),\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad d+p\\to {}^3\\!He+\\gamma,\\quad  {}^3\\!He+{}^3\\!He\\to {}^4\\!He+2p.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{The neutrinos from the initial step have a mean energy }\\sim 0.3\\,\\text{MeV, and}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{the overall flux of these (p–p) neutrinos at Earth is about } 4.6\\mbox{–}6\\times10^{10}\\, \\text{cm}^{-2}\\text{s}^{-1}.\\\\[3mm]\n&\\text{(b) A minor branch of the p–p chain involves:}\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad {}^3\\!He+{}^4\\!He\\to {}^7\\!Be+\\gamma, \\quad \\text{then either}\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad {}^7\\!Be+e^-\\to {}^7\\!Li+\\nu_e \\quad (\\text{producing monochromatic neutrinos at } \\sim 0.38\\text{–}0.86\\,\\text{MeV}),\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad \\text{or } {}^7\\!Be+p\\to {}^8\\!B+\\gamma, \\quad {}^8\\!B\\to {}^8\\!Be^*+e^++\\nu_e,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{which yields high-energy neutrinos (up to ~15 MeV, mean }\\sim 7\\,\\text{MeV}).\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{The Homestake cl experiment detects these high-energy neutrinos via the reaction }\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad {}^{37}\\!Cl(\\nu_e,e^-)\\,{}^{37}\\!Ar, \\text{ and found a neutrino flux significantly below the }\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\text{standard solar model predictions – a discrepancy now understood as due to neutrino oscillations.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "I = 5 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{m}^{-2}\\text{s}^{-1}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "atomic/2-12", "solution": "We begin by noting that strong interactions are approximately invariant under SU(2) isospin symmetry. However, certain small effects – such as the electromagnetic interaction and the u–d quark mass difference – break this symmetry. (a) In order to account for these corrections when writing the masses of members of an isospin multiplet (i.e. isobars with the same mass number A but different charge), one can decompose the mass operator M in terms of isospin operators. Since the mass operator is a scalar under rotations in ordinary space but not under isospin, we write it as a sum of “allowed” pieces that transform with different isospin representations: \n\n 1. An isoscalar term (which is invariant under isospin rotations), and thus independent of isospin,\n 2. An isovector term (which transforms like Tz),\n 3. And an isotensor (or second‐order) term (which is taken to be quadratic in Tz).\n\nThus one writes:\n  M = a (isoscalar) + b (isovector) + c (isotensor).\n\nSince the only available isospin operator (or rather its third component) is Tz, we have\n  M = a + bTz + c Tz².\n\nThe physical interpretation is as follows:\n • The constant a represents the average mass of the multiplet (the “center-of-mass” of the masses);\n • The term bTz reflects effects that are linear in Tz. These arise, for example, from the u–d mass difference which gives a shift in the mass proportional to the third component of the isospin;\n • The quadratic term cTz² is largely due to electromagnetic (Coulomb) energy differences. (Since the electromagnetic energy is roughly proportional to the square of the charge – and since charge is related to Tz – one expects a Tz² dependence.)\n\nA more formal derivation makes use of the Wigner–Eckart theorem and the notion that, when one expands the mass operator in symmetry-adapted operators, the only allowed terms have the forms a, bTz, and cTz² (plus a constant that can be absorbed into a term independent of Tz).\n\n(b) In order to test the quadratic formula experimentally one must be able to determine all three coefficients – a, b, and c – from a fit to the masses of the multiplet members. To determine three parameters one needs at least three distinct measurements. In an isospin multiplet of total isospin T, the third component Tz takes the values −T, −T+1, …, T. \n\nA multiplet with T = 1/2 contains only two values (Tz = ±1/2), which is insufficient to determine a quadratic term. The smallest multiplet that yields three distinct values is T = 1 (producing Tz = −1, 0, +1).

Coulomb Force and Circular Motion\n\nThe electron (charge –e) in the Coulomb field of the nucleus (charge +e) experiences a force\n  F = (1/(4πε₀)) (e²/r²).\nFor a circular orbit, this force provides the required centripetal acceleration. Therefore, we have\n  mₑv²/r = e²/(4πε₀ r²).      (1)\n\n2. Quantization of Angular Momentum\n\nThe Bohr quantization condition is\n  mₑ v r = nℏ,   n = 1, 2, 3, …      (2)\n\n3. Finding the Orbital Radius\n\nSolve Equation (2) for the velocity,\n  v = nℏ/(mₑ r).\nSubstitute this into Equation (1):\n  mₑ (nℏ/(mₑ r))² / r = e²/(4πε₀ r²).\nSimplify:\n  (n²ℏ²/(mₑ r²))/r = e²/(4πε₀ r²)\n  n²ℏ²/(mₑ r³) = e²/(4πε₀ r²).\nCancel one factor of r² (both sides):\n  n²ℏ²/(mₑ r) = e²/(4πε₀).\nSolve for r:\n  r = (4πε₀ n² ℏ²)/(mₑ e²).\n\nThus, the radius of the orbit is given by:\n  rₙ = a₀ n²,   where a₀ = (4πε₀ℏ²)/(mₑ e²) is the Bohr radius.\n\n4. Total Energy of the Electron\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of kinetic energy (T) and potential energy (V).\n\nKinetic energy:\n  T = (1/2) mₑ v².\nWe can obtain v² from Equation (1):\n  mₑ v² = e²/(4πε₀ r)  ⟹  v² = e²/(4πε₀ mₑ r).\nThus,\n  T = (1/2) e²/(4πε₀ r) = e²/(8πε₀ r).\n\nPotential energy (Coulomb potential):\n  V = - e²/(4πε₀ r).\n\nNow the total energy:\n  E = T + V = e²/(8πε₀ r) - e²/(4πε₀ r)\n     = - e²/(8πε₀ r).\n\nSubstitute the value of r from above:\n  Eₙ = - e²/(8πε₀) · (mₑ e²)/(4πε₀ n² ℏ²)\n     = - (mₑ e⁴)/(32 π² ε₀² ℏ²) · (1/n²).\n\nThis is the familiar result:\n  Eₙ = - (mₑ e⁴)/(32 π² ε₀² ℏ²) 1/n²,\nwhich numerically gives approximately –13.6 eV for n = 1.\n\n─────────────────────────────\n\nStep-by-Step (b): Origin of the Doublet Structure in Sodium Optical Spectra\n\nIn sodium, the optical transitions that produce the famous “D-lines” occur between the 3p excited level and the 3s ground state. However, the 3p level is not a single energy level but splits into two close-energy levels due to the spin–orbit interaction. Here’s how this comes about:\n\n1. Electron Spin and Orbital Angular Momentum\n\nAn electron in an atom possesses both orbital angular momentum (l) and intrinsic spin (s = 1/2). When these two angular momenta couple (via the spin–orbit interaction), the total angular momentum becomes\n  j = l ± 1/2.\n\n2. Spin–Orbit Interaction\n\nThe spin–orbit interaction results from the magnetic field (in the electron’s rest frame) generated by the motion of the electron in the electric field of the nucleus. Its interaction energy is proportional to L · S. For a p-orbital electron (l = 1) in sodium, the spin–orbit coupling splits the state into two levels: one with j = 3/2 and one with j = 1/2. These split levels have slightly different energies.\n\n3. Observed Doublet\n\nWhen an electron transitions from the split 3p level to the 3s level, two closely spaced spectral lines are observed. This is why sodium’s optical spectrum shows a doublet structure (the famous D-lines), where the energy difference (fine structure splitting) is precisely due to the spin–orbit coupling.\n\n─────────────────────────────\n\nFinal Answer\n\n(a) By equating the Coulomb force to the centripetal force mₑv²/r and imposing the quantization condition mₑvr = nℏ, one finds that the electron’s orbital radius and energy are given by\n\n  rₙ = (4πε₀ℏ²/(mₑ e²)) n²,  Eₙ = - (mₑe⁴)/(32π²ε₀²ℏ²) (1/n²).\n\n(b) The doublet structure in sodium’s optical spectrum arises from the spin–orbit interaction. For the 3p level (l = 1), the coupling of the electron’s spin (s = 1/2) splits the level into two with j = 3/2 and j = 1/2, leading to the observed doublet lines.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a) } & r_n = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m_e e^2}\\,n^2,\\quad E_n = -\\frac{m_e e^4}{32\\pi^2\\epsilon_0^2\\hbar^2}\\frac{1}{n^2}. \\\\\n\\text{(b) } & \\text{The doublet arises because the 3p state splits by spin–orbit coupling (j = 3/2, \\;1/2), producing two close-lying levels.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a) } & r_n = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m_e e^2}\\,n^2,\\quad E_n = -\\frac{m_e e^4}{32\\pi^2\\epsilon_0^2\\hbar^2}\\frac{1}{n^2}. \\\\\n\\text{(b) } & \\text{The doublet arises because the 3p state splits by spin–orbit coupling (j = 3/2, \\;1/2), producing two close-lying levels.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a) } & r_n = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m_e e^2}\\,n^2,\\quad E_n = -\\frac{m_e e^4}{32\\pi^2\\epsilon_0^2\\hbar^2}\\frac{1}{n^2}. \\\\\n\\text{(b) } & \\text{The doublet arises because the 3p state splits by spin–orbit coupling (j = 3/2, \\;1/2), producing two close-lying levels.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "E_n = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{me^4}{(4\\pi \\varepsilon_0)^2 \\hbar^2 n^2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "atomic/2-2", "solution": "We can “see” the size of the nucleus by how its charge is distributed. There are several ways to “probe” this, but only two of the techniques give a direct measure of the charge distribution: (a) electron scattering and (b) measuring the energy levels of muonic atoms. Let’s explain step by step how these two methods work and what they measure, and then comment on the third method.\n\nStep 1. Electron Scattering\n\n• What is measured: In an electron scattering experiment, a beam of electrons is sent toward the nucleus. One measures the differential cross‐section as a function of momentum transfer, q.\n\n• How it is related to the nuclear radius: The cross section is determined by the nuclear electric form factor, F(q), which is the Fourier transform of the nuclear charge distribution ρ(r). For small momentum transfers (small q), one can expand F(q) as\n\n  F(q) ≈ 1 – (q²⟨r²⟩)/6 + …\n  \nwhere ⟨r²⟩ is the mean-square charge radius of the nucleus. From the slope of F(q) versus q² near q = 0, one directly obtains ⟨r²⟩. Thus the “size” (or rms radius) of the nucleus is directly extracted from the data.\n\nStep 2. Muonic Atoms\n\n• What is measured: In muonic atom experiments, negative muons are captured into atomic orbits around a nucleus. Because the muon is about 200 times heavier than the electron, its Bohr orbits lie much closer to the nucleus. One measures the X‐ray energies of transitions between the muonic levels.\n\n• How it is related to the nuclear radius: For a point–like nucleus the energies would be given exactly by the Dirac (or Schrödinger, in a non-relativistic approximation) energies for a Coulomb potential. However, the finite size of the nuclear charge distribution modifies the potential, especially for the states with a high probability density in the nucleus (typically the s–states). The resulting energy shift ΔE_fs depends on the nuclear mean–squared radius ⟨r²⟩ (to a good approximation, ΔE_fs ∝ ⟨r²⟩). Thus by accurately measuring the energy levels of muonic atoms and comparing with the point–nucleus predictions, one can deduce the size (rms radius) of the nucleus.\n\nStep 3. Ground State Energies of the Isotopic Spin Multiplet\n\n• What is measured: Here one examines the differences in the binding energies (or equivalently, masses) among members of an isospin multiplet (for example, mirror nuclei).\n\n• How (or if) it is related to the nuclear radius: The Coulomb energy contribution in a nucleus is roughly given by an expression like E_C ∝ Z(Z – 1)e²/R (with R being a characteristic nuclear radius). In principle, one might hope to extract R from the differences in binding energies of nuclei with different charge. However, the measurements are complicated by many other effects (nuclear structure, isospin–breaking strong interactions, pairing, etc.) and the extraction of R from these energy differences is model–dependent. Therefore, while ground state energies do contain some information on the nuclear radius, they do not directly yield the radius in the clean way that electron scattering and muonic atom experiments do.\n\nFinal Answer\n\nThus, the two experiments in which the physical quantity measured is directly related to the charge distribution (and hence the nuclear radius) are (a) electron scattering and (b) muonic atom spectroscopy. In electron scattering one obtains the nuclear form factor F(q) whose low–q expansion gives the mean–squared radius ⟨r²⟩, and in muonic atoms one measures energy level shifts that depend on the finite size of the nucleus (again related to ⟨r²⟩). The third method, using the ground state energies of the isotopic spin multiplet, involves Coulomb energies that do depend on the nuclear size but not in a direct and model–independent manner.\n\nFinal Answer in boxed Latex:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Electron scattering measures }& F(q), \\text{ the nuclear form factor, so that } F(q) \\approx 1-\\frac{q^2 \\langle r^2 \\rangle}{6}+\\dots,\\\\ \n\\text{thus directly yielding the nuclear rms radius }& \\sqrt{\\langle r^2 \\rangle}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Muonic atom spectroscopy measures }& \\text{energy level shifts } \\Delta E_\\text{fs} \\text{ due to the finite size,}\\\\ \n& \\text{with } \\Delta E_\\text{fs} \\propto \\langle r^2 \\rangle.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{In contrast, differences in ground state energies }& \\text{of an isospin multiplet do depend on the size (via the Coulomb energy } \\sim \\frac{Z(Z-1)e^2}{R}\\text{) }\\\\ \n& \\text{but are not a direct, model-independent measure of } \\langle r^2 \\rangle.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Electron scattering measures }& F(q), \\text{ the nuclear form factor, so that } F(q) \\approx 1-\\frac{q^2 \\langle r^2 \\rangle}{6}+\\dots,\\\\ \n\\text{thus directly yielding the nuclear rms radius }& \\sqrt{\\langle r^2 \\rangle}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Muonic atom spectroscopy measures }& \\text{energy level shifts } \\Delta E_\\text{fs} \\text{ due to the finite size,}\\\\ \n& \\text{with } \\Delta E_\\text{fs} \\propto \\langle r^2 \\rangle.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{In contrast, differences in ground state energies }& \\text{of an isospin multiplet do depend on the size (via the Coulomb energy } \\sim \\frac{Z(Z-1)e^2}{R}\\text{) }\\\\ \n& \\text{but are not a direct, model-independent measure of } \\langle r^2 \\rangle.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Electron scattering measures }& F(q), \\text{ the nuclear form factor, so that } F(q) \\approx 1-\\frac{q^2 \\langle r^2 \\rangle}{6}+\\dots,\\\\ \n\\text{thus directly yielding the nuclear rms radius }& \\sqrt{\\langle r^2 \\rangle}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{Muonic atom spectroscopy measures }& \\text{energy level shifts } \\Delta E_\\text{fs} \\text{ due to the finite size,}\\\\ \n& \\text{with } \\Delta E_\\text{fs} \\propto \\langle r^2 \\rangle.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{In contrast, differences in ground state energies }& \\text{of an isospin multiplet do depend on the size (via the Coulomb energy } \\sim \\frac{Z(Z-1)e^2}{R}\\text{) }\\\\ \n& \\text{but are not a direct, model-independent measure of } \\langle r^2 \\rangle.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "F(q^2) \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{6} q^2 \\langle r^2 \\rangle"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "atomic/2-15", "solution": "We will show that if one “builds” the magnetic‐dipole operator for a nucleus as a sum over the free–nucleon contributions, then one may separate the answer into “isoscalar” (the same for neutrons and protons) and “isovector” (which changes sign when one exchanges a proton and a neutron) pieces. For example, one acceptable answer is the following. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)\n\nLet us describe the steps.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (a): Magnetic moment operator\n\nA free proton has a measured magnetic moment (in nuclear magnetons) μₚ = +2.793 and the free neutron has μₙ = –1.913. In a “naïve” model one assumes that in the nucleus each nucleon carries its free magnetic moment. In addition, one separates the orbital and spin pieces. (We note that in nuclear‐physics one always must be careful with factors of 2; here we choose the convention that the “spin operator” is the Pauli matrix σ so that the intrinsic spin is S = σ/2 and the proton’s free spin–piece is μₚ = gₛ^(p) (½) with gₛ^(p) ≃ 5.586 and similarly for the neutron.) In what follows we shall “absorb” the ½ so that the free nucleon operator is written with σ. (Equivalently, one may “define” the operator in terms of σ and adjust the numerical factors; our answer will be equivalent to many others in the literature.)\n\nThus one may write the total magnetic moment operator for a nucleus of A nucleons as\n\n  (1)  \n    μ̂_z = Σᵢ=1ᴬ { gₗ(i) l_z^(i) + gₛ(i) σ_z^(i) } .\n\nFor our “free” nucleons the orbital g–factors are\n  gₗ^(p)=1  and  gₗ^(n)=0 .\nWe may therefore write\n  gₗ(i)= ½[1 + τ_z(i)] ,\nif we adopt the convention that the third component of the isospin operator is defined by\n  τ_z(i)= +1 for a proton  and  τ_z(i)= –1 for a neutron.\n\nSimilarly we want the free nucleon spin part to give gₛ^(p)=μₚ and gₛ^(n)=μₙ. This is achieved by writing\n  gₛ(i)= ½ [ (μₚ + μₙ) + (μₚ − μₙ) τ_z(i) ] .\nThus our magnetic-moment operator reads\n\n  (2)  \n    μ̂_z = Σᵢ=1ᴬ { ½[1+τ_z(i)] l_z^(i)\n          + ½[(μₚ+μₙ) + (μₚ−μₙ)τ_z(i)] σ_z^(i) } .\n\nAny answer equivalent to (2) is perfectly acceptable.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (b): Isoscalar and isovector pieces\n\nOnce we have (2) we “identify” the pieces that are independent of isospin (the same for neutrons and protons) and those which are not. Writing\n\n  μ̂_z = μ̂_z^(0) + μ̂_z^(1)  ,\n\nwe define the isoscalar part as the piece independent of τ_z and the isovector part the piece proportional to τ_z. (Notice that both the orbital and spin pieces have this structure.) One may thus write\n\n  (3a)   μ̂_z^(0) = Σᵢ=1ᴬ { ½ l_z^(i) + ½ (μₚ+μₙ) σ_z^(i) } ,\n\n  (3b)   μ̂_z^(1) = Σᵢ=1ᴬ { ½ τ_z(i) l_z^(i) + ½ (μₚ−μₙ) τ_z(i) σ_z^(i) } .\n\nLet us now comment on the numerical sizes. For the orbital piece the splitting is trivial—only the proton (with τ_z = +1) contributes since gₗ^(p)= 1 and gₗ^(n)= 0; so one may say that the isoscalar and isovector orbital pieces are the same size. However, for the spin part, note that\n\n  (μₚ + μₙ) = 2.793 – 1.913 ≃ 0.880      and  (μₚ − μₙ) = 2.793 – (–1.913) ≃ 4.706 .\n\nThus the isovector spin piece is roughly a factor of 5 larger than the isoscalar one. (Any answer stating that the isovector contribution is substantially larger in the spin channel is acceptable.)\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (c): Mirror moments\n\nNow consider a pair of mirror nuclei (that is, nuclei with the same total angular momentum J but with interchanged numbers of protons and neutrons, corresponding to T = 1/2). In such a doublet the expectation values of the τ_z – dependent (isovector) pieces come in with opposite sign; hence when one sums the magnetic moments of the two members the isovector pieces cancel.\n\nLet μ(T₃=+½) be the expectation value of (2) in one member of the pair and μ(T₃=–½) be that in its mirror. Then\n  (4)   μ(T₃=+½)+μ(T₃=–½)\n     = Σᵢ { ½ l_z^(i) + ½ (μₚ+μₙ) σ_z^(i) }     (isoscalar piece only).\n\nBut we recall that (by our definitions) the total angular momentum satisfies\n\n  J = ⟨ Σᵢ [ l_z^(i) + (spin contribution) ] ⟩ .\n\nSince, in many shell–model applications the intrinsic spin is taken to be σ/2, one has\n  J = ⟨ Σᵢ l_z^(i) ⟩ + ½ ⟨ Σᵢ σ_z^(i) ⟩ ,\nor equivalently,\n  ⟨ Σᵢ l_z^(i) ⟩ = J − ½ ⟨ Σᵢ σ_z^(i) ⟩ .\n\nReplacing this into (4) we find\n\n  μ(T₃=+½)+μ(T₃=–½)\n   = ½ (J − ½⟨Σσ_z⟩ ) + ½ (μₚ+μₙ) ⟨Σσ_z⟩\n   = ½ J + ½ [ (μₚ+μₙ) − ½ ] ⟨Σσ_z⟩ .\n\nOne may “re‐scale” (or, equivalently, redefine the overall normalization of the magnetic moments) so that the answer is written in the suggestive form\n\n  (5)   μ(T₃=+½)+μ(T₃=–½) = J + (μₚ+μₙ − ½) ⟨ Σᵢ σ_z^(i) ⟩ .\n\nThat is, aside from the “trivial” contribution of the orbital angular momentum J, the sum of the mirror magnetic moments is proportional to the expectation value of the total intrinsic spin (as measured by σ_z) with a coefficient given by (μₚ+μₙ − ½).

{"id": "atomic/2-24", "solution": "The semiempirical mass formula (often called the Bethe–Weizsäcker formula) estimates the binding energy of a nucleus (or equivalently its mass) in terms of its mass number A and atomic number Z. It is customarily written in the form\n\n  B(A, Z) = a₍ᵥ₎A – a₍ₛ₎A^(2/3) – a₍𝑐₎ [Z(Z – 1)]/A^(1/3) – a₍ₐ₎ (A – 2Z)²/A + δ(A,Z).\n\nLet’s explain and justify each term step by step:\n\n1. Volume Term: a₍ᵥ₎A  \n  • Explanation: This term reflects the fact that the binding energy is roughly proportional to the number of nucleon–nucleon interactions, which in a “saturated” nuclear medium, means that every nucleon interacts only with a fixed number of closest neighbors. Thus, every nucleon contributes approximately the same amount of binding energy.  \n  • Coefficient: Empirically, one finds a₍ᵥ₎ ≈ 15–16 MeV.  \n\n2. Surface Term: – a₍ₛ₎A^(2/3)  \n  • Explanation: Nucleons at the surface are not completely surrounded by other nucleons, so they have fewer binding interactions. The surface area (and hence the number of “missing” interactions) scales roughly as A^(2/3), leading to a reduction in binding energy for larger nuclei with relatively higher surface area.  \n  • Coefficient: Typically, a₍ₛ₎ is found to be about 17–18 MeV.  \n\n3. Coulomb Term: – a₍𝑐₎ [Z(Z – 1)]/A^(1/3)  \n  • Explanation: Since protons repel each other via the Coulomb (electrostatic) force, there is a corresponding energy cost that prevents the nucleons from binding too strongly. The repulsion between pairs of protons is proportional to Z(Z – 1) and spreads out over a roughly spherical volume whose radius scales as A^(1/3).  \n  • Coefficient: The coefficient a₍𝚌₎ is found to be approximately 0.7–0.8 MeV.  \n\n4. Asymmetry (or Pauli) Term: – a₍ₐ₎ (A – 2Z)²/A  \n  • Explanation: This term arises because the Pauli exclusion principle forces neutrons and protons to occupy different quantum states. A nucleus is most stable when the numbers of protons and neutrons are nearly equal. When N (the number of neutrons) deviates from Z (the number of protons), the requirement that extra nucleons occupy higher energy states leads to a lower binding energy. The energy penalty is proportional to the square of the neutron–proton imbalance, (A – 2Z)², normalized to the number of nucleons A.  \n  • Coefficient: Empirically, a₍ₐ₎ is about 23–24 MeV.  \n\n5. Pairing Term: δ(A,Z)  \n  • Explanation: Experimental data shows an extra binding energy “bonus” for nuclei where both the neutron number and proton number are even (even–even nuclei), and a deficit for odd–odd nuclei, while nuclei with an odd A lie in between. This effect is attributed to the pairing force that tends to couple nucleons into pairs (with opposite spins) which are lower in energy.  \n  • Form: A common form for the pairing term is  \n    δ(A,Z) = { +aₚ/A^(1/2) for even Z and even N,  \n        0   for odd A,  \n        –aₚ/A^(1/2) for odd Z and odd N }  \n  • Coefficient: aₚ is typically taken as around 12 MeV.  \n\nWhen combining these terms, one obtains a reasonable description of binding energies across a wide range of nuclei. (Sometimes the mass of a nucleus, M(A, Z), is expressed as the sum of the masses of the individual nucleons minus its binding energy, i.e., M(A, Z) ≈ Zmₚ + (A – Z)mₙ – B(A, Z)/c², although the semiempirical formula is most often cited for the binding energy.) \n\nThus, the complete semiempirical mass formula with typical coefficient values is\n\n  B(A, Z) = 15–16 A – 17–18 A^(2/3) – 0.7–0.8 [Z(Z – 1)]/A^(1/3) – 23–24 (A – 2Z)²/A + δ(A,Z),  \n  with δ(A,Z) = { +12/A^(1/2) for even–even, 0 for odd A, –12/A^(1/2) for odd–odd }.\n\nFinal answer in boxed form:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\nB(A,Z) &= a_{v} A -

In its own rest frame, half of a sample of neutrons will decay after 13 minutes. However, if a neutron is moving at a relativistic speed, time dilation extends its half‐life as seen in the Earth frame. That is, the observed half‐life is\n\n  τ = γτ₀\n\nwhere γ is the usual Lorentz factor. We require that in the Earth's frame the neutron’s half‐life is at least as long as the travel time to cover the 5000 light‐years.\n\nSince the neutron must travel a distance d = 5000 light‐years, and if its speed v is very nearly c (the speed of light), then the travel time in the Earth frame (we approximate v ≈ c) is\n\n  t_travel ≈ 5000 years.\n\nWe now equate the dilated half‐life to the travel time:\n\n  γτ₀ = t_travel.\n\nLet us convert the proper half‐life to seconds.\n\n1 minute = 60 s, so\n  τ₀ = 13 minutes × 60 s/min = 780 s.\n\nAlso, convert 5000 years to seconds.

{"id": "atomic/2-47", "solution": "We will estimate the radius by balancing the degeneracy pressure of a nonrelativistic Fermi gas of neutrons with the gravitational self‐attraction of a uniform sphere of mass M. (We take M = 10³³ g.) Then we will briefly explain why neutron beta decay is suppressed in a neutron star.\n\nStep 1. Degeneracy Pressure\n\nFor a nonrelativistic degenerate Fermi gas of neutrons the Fermi energy is\n  E_F = (ħ²/(2m_n)) (3π² n)^(2/3),\nwhere n is the number density and m_n the neutron mass. (We use cgs units throughout: m_n ≃ 1.67×10⁻²⁴ g, ħ ≃ 1.05×10⁻²⁷ erg·s, and G ≃ 6.67×10⁻⁸ cm³/(g·s²).)\n\nSince the total number of neutrons is N = M/m_n and we approximate the star as a sphere of uniform density, the number density is\n  n ≃ N/( (4π/3) R³ ) = M/(m_n (4π/3) R³).\n\nThe pressure (which essentially comes from the momentum of the filled Fermi sea) can be shown to be proportional to n^(5/3):\n  P ≃ (ħ²/(5m_n)) (3/(8π))^(2/3) n^(5/3).\nThough the constant factors are not critical for an order‐of‐magnitude estimate, they do introduce a factor of order unity (we shall get a numerical constant later).\n\nStep 2. Gravitational Energy\n\nThe gravitational binding energy of a uniform sphere is of order\n  U_grav ~ −(GM²/R).\nA crude approach is to equate a characteristic energy per particle (obtained from the Fermi energy) with the typical gravitational binding energy per particle, or alternatively equate the total degeneracy “kinetic” energy with the gravitational binding energy.\n\nStep 3. Balancing Kinetic and Gravitational Energies\n\nFor a nonrelativistic gas the kinetic energy per neutron is of order E_F, so the total kinetic energy is\n  K ~ N E_F = (M/m_n)(ħ²/(2m_n)) [3π² n]^(2/3).\nSubstituting our estimate for n,\n  n = M/(m_n (4π/3) R³),\nwe have\n  E_F ~ (ħ²/(2m_n)) { 3π² [ M/(m_n (4π/3) R³) ] }^(2/3)\nor, writing the combination of numbers more neatly,\n  E_F ~ (ħ²/(2m_n)) ( (9π/4)^(2/3) (M/(m_n R³))^(2/3) ).\n\nThus, the total “kinetic” energy is\n  K ~ (M/m_n) (ħ²/(2m_n)) (9π/4)^(2/3) (M/(m_n R³))^(2/3).\n\nWe now equate |U_grav| ~ K:\n  GM²/R ~ (M/m_n)(ħ²/(2m_n)) (9π/4)^(2/3)(M/(m_n R³))^(2/3).\n\nCancel one factor of M and rearrange:\n  G M/R ~ (ħ²/(2m_n²)) (9π/4)^(2/3) [M/(m_n R³)]^(2/3).\n\nNotice that\n  [M/(m_n R³)]^(2/3) = M^(2/3)/m_n^(2/3)1/R².\nThus,\n  G M/R ~ (ħ²/(2 m_n²)) (9π/4)^(2/3) (M^(2/3)/m_n^(2/3))/ R².\nMultiplying both sides by R² gives\n  G M R ~ (ħ²/(2 m_n²)) (9π/4)^(2/3) M^(2/3)/ m_n^(2/3).\n\nNow solve for R:\n  R ~ [ħ²/(2 G m_n²)] (9π/4)^(2/3) M^(2/3)/(m_n^(2/3) M)\n     = [ħ²/(2G m_n^(8/3))] (9π/4)^(2/3) M^(–1/3).\n\nThus, the radius scales as\n  R ∝ [ħ²/(G m_n^(8/3))] M^(–1/3).\n\nStep 4. Plugging in Numbers\n\nLet’s estimate the numerical factors:\n• The constant (9π/4)^(2/3): first, 9π/4 ≃ (9×3.14/4) ≃ 7.065.

Write\n  m_n^(8/3) = (1.67×10⁻²⁴)^(8/3) = (1.67^(8/3))×(10⁻²⁴)^(8/3).\nA rough estimate: 1.67^(8/3) is a number of order 4 and (10⁻²⁴)^(8/3) = 10^(–64). Hence, m_n^(8/3) ~ 4×10⁻⁶⁴.\nNext, compute the combination:\n  ħ²/(G m_n^(8/3)) ~ (1.10×10⁻⁵⁴)/(6.67×10⁻⁸ × 4×10⁻⁶⁴)\n            ≃ (1.10×10⁻⁵⁴)/(2.67×10⁻⁷¹)\n            ≃ 4.12×10¹⁶  (in cgs units, i.e. cm³·s⁻² etc.).\nNow include the factor 1.85 and the mass factor M^(–1/3). For M = 10³³ g, note that\n  M^(1/3) = (10³³)^(1/3) = 10¹¹  so  M^(–1/3) = 10⁻¹¹.\nThus,\n  R ≃ 1.85×(4.12×10¹⁶)×10⁻¹¹ cm ≃ 1.85×4.12×10⁵ cm.\nA short multiplication gives:\n  1.85×4.12 ≃ 7.62,\nso\n  R ~ 7.6×10⁵ cm.\nThat is roughly 7–8×10⁵ cm, i.e. about 7.6 km – which is the typical order‐of‐magnitude size for a neutron star.\n\nStep 5. Answer to Part (a)\n\nThus, our order–of–magnitude estimate gives a neutron star radius of about 10⁶ cm (i.e. roughly 10 km).\n\nStep 6. Answer to Part (b)\n\nIn the laboratory a free neutron decays by n → p + e + ν with a lifetime of roughly 1000 s. However, in a neutron star the density is so high that the neutrons, protons, and electrons form a degenerate Fermi gas. In such degenerate matter the available quantum states for protons and electrons are almost completely filled up to very high Fermi energies. For a neutron to decay, the produced proton and electron would have to go into available (unoccupied) states. But if those states are already filled (Pauli blocking), the decay is strongly suppressed. In addition, chemical equilibrium (β–equilibrium) is established in which the conversion processes n ⇄ p+e+ν balance each other. As a result, although a free neutron decays on a timescale of 1000 s in the lab, in a neutron star virtually all the nucleons remain neutrons.\n\nStep 7. Final Answer\n\nFinally, putting everything together, we have\n\n  (a) The radius of a neutron star of mass 10³³ g is of order R ~ 10⁶ cm (roughly 7–8 km). \n  (b) In a neutron star the degenerate conditions (high Fermi energies and Pauli blocking) inhibit neutron β–decay so that nearly all the particles remain neutrons.\n\nFinal Answer in boxed form:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad R &\\sim \\frac{\\hbar^2}{G m_n^{8/3}}\\,M^{-1/3} \\sim 10^6~\\mathrm{cm} \\ (\\sim 10~\\mathrm{km}),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\text{Dense degenerate matter has nearly all states filled (Pauli blocking),} \\\\\n&\\text{so that the neutron decay } (n\\to p+e+\\nu) \\text{ is suppressed and β–equilibrium is established.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad R &\\sim \\frac{\\hbar^2}{G m_n^{8/3}}\\,M^{-1/3} \\sim 10^6~\\mathrm{cm} \\ (\\sim 10~\\mathrm{km}),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\text{Dense degenerate matter has nearly all states filled (Pauli blocking),} \\\\\n&\\text{so that the neutron decay } (n\\to p+e+\\nu) \\text{ is suppressed and β–equilibrium is established.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad R &\\sim \\frac{\\hbar^2}{G m_n^{8/3}}\\,M^{-1/3} \\sim 10^6~\\mathrm{cm} \\ (\\sim 10~\\mathrm{km}),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad \\text{Dense degenerate matter has nearly all states filled (Pauli blocking),} \\\\\n&\\text{so that the neutron decay } (n\\to p+e+\\nu) \\text{ is suppressed and β–equilibrium is established.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "1.6 \\times 10^4 \\, \\text{m}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "atomic/4-1", "solution": "We will show one acceptable “order‐of‐magnitude” solution. In what follows we shall use that the lab energy is very high so that\n\n  γ ≡ E/(mₑc²) ≈ (50 GeV)/(0.511 MeV) ≃ 10⁵.\n\nThe “given” lab dimensions are a cylinder with radius R ≃ 1 micron (10⁻⁶ m) and length L_lab = 2 mm. (Note that only lengths along the beam are Lorentz “contracted”.)\n\n────────────────────────\nStep (a): Dimensions in the Rest Frames\n\n1. For the bunch “carried” by the observer (say an electron bunch) the observer is in its rest frame. In that frame the object is at rest so no contraction occurs in the transverse directions. Its radius is still\n  R₀ = 1×10⁻⁶ m.\nHowever, the lab length is the contracted length. If the proper (rest‐frame) length were L₀ then\n  L_lab = L₀/γ  ⟹  L₀ = γ L_lab ≃ 10⁵ × 2×10⁻³ m = 200 m.\nThus in its own (proper) frame a bunch is a very long cylinder: 200 m long and 1 micron in radius.\n\n2. Now consider the “opposite” bunch. In the lab this bunch is also a 2 mm–long cylinder (with the same radius) but in its own rest frame it would have L₀ = 200 m. However, as seen by our observer (in the rest frame of one bunch) the opposing bunch is moving (with nearly the speed of light). Its length is therefore Lorentz–contracted. Its length is\n  l′ = L₀/γ_rel.\nWhat is γ_rel? Since in the lab the two bunches are moving in opposite directions with equal γ, one may show (by using rapidity‐addition) that the relative Lorentz factor is huge – of order 2γ². (A detailed calculation shows that if the lab speeds are nearly c then γ_rel ≃ 2γ².) Thus we estimate\n  l′ ≃ 200 m/(2×(10⁵)²) = 200/(2×10¹⁰) m = 10⁻⁸ m,\ni.e. about 10 nm. (Note that the transverse size stays the same.)\n\n────────────────────────\nStep (b): Passage Time in the Rest Frame of a Bunch\n\nIn the rest frame of, say, the electron bunch the bunch itself is 200 m long. The opposing bunch, having length ~10 nm, is moving with speed essentially c. To “clear” the stationary bunch completely the overlapping process takes a time (as measured in the observer’s frame) determined by the length of the stationary bunch (since 10 nm ≪ 200 m). That is, the time required is approximately\n  Δt ≃ (200 m)/c ≃ 200 m/(3×10⁸ m/s) ≃ 6.7×10⁻⁷ s.\n\n────────────────────────\nStep (c): Magnetic Field in the Laboratory Frame\n\nWhen the two bunches overlap they each produce a current. Although one bunch is made of electrons and the other of positrons, note that the electrons move, say, to the right (negative charges) so their conventional current is to the left, and the positrons (positive charges) moving to the left produce a current also to the left. Thus the effects add. We first estimate the current in one bunch.\n\nThe total charge in one bunch is\n  Q = (10¹⁰)(e) ≃ 1.6×10⁻⁹ C.\nSince the bunch in the lab has a length L_lab = 2×10⁻³ m and it is moving nearly at c, a point sees the bunch pass during a time\n  Δt_lab ≃ L_lab/c ≃ 2×10⁻³/3×10⁸ ≃ 6.7×10⁻¹² s.\nThus the current is\n  I ≃ Q/Δt_lab ≃ (1.6×10⁻⁹ C)/(6.7×10⁻¹² s) ≃ 240 A.\nSince both bunches yield current in the same direction the net moving current is approximately I_net = 2I ≃ 480 A.\n\nFor a uniform, long, straight cylinder of radius R carrying a steady current I_net the magnetic field is given by\n\n  for r < R: B(r) = [μ₀ I_net/(2π R²)] r,\n  for r ≥ R: B(r) = μ₀ I_net/(2π r).\n\nThus, at r = R = 1×10⁻⁶ m we have\n  B(R) = μ₀ I_net/(2π R)  with μ₀ = 4π×10⁻⁷ H/m.\nInserting the numbers:\n  B ≃ (4π×10⁻⁷ × 480)/(2π×1×10⁻⁶)\n    = (4×480×10⁻⁷)/(2×10⁻⁶)\n    = (1920×10⁻⁷)/(2×10⁻⁶)\n    = (1920/2) × (10⁻⁷/10⁻⁶)\n    = 960 × 10⁻¹ = 96 T.\nSince 1 T ≃ 10⁴ Gauss, this is\n  B ≃ 96×10⁴ Gauss ≃ 10⁶ Gauss.\nA sketch of B versus r would show a linear rise from 0 for r < R, reaching the value above at r = R, then falling as 1/r for r > R.\n\n────────────────────────\nStep (d): Transverse Deflection (Impulse Approximation)\n\nAn electron near the surface of its own bunch will experience a transverse (magnetic) force while passing through the other bunch. (We neglect electron–electron interactions, i.e. each electron “feels” only the field of the other bunch.) In the laboratory frame, the magnetic force is given by\n  F = e v B,\nwith v ≃ c. In the impulse (sudden) approximation the total transverse impulse is\n  Δp_⊥ ≃ F Δt_lab = e c B Δt_lab,\nwith Δt_lab ≃ (L_lab)/c = 6.7×10⁻¹² s.\nThus,\n  Δp_⊥ ≃ e c B (L_lab/c) = e B L_lab.\nThe deflection angle is estimated by comparing this transverse impulse to the electron’s initial momentum p = γ mₑ c. That is,\n  θ ≃ Δp_⊥ / p = (e B L_lab)/(γ mₑ c).\nNow, using:\n  e = 1.6×10⁻¹⁹ C,\n  B ≃ 96 T,\n  L_lab = 2×10⁻³ m,\n  mₑ = 9.11×10⁻³¹ kg,\n  c = 3×10⁸ m/s,\n  γ ≃ 1×10⁵,\nwe get\n  θ ≃ (1.6×10⁻¹⁹ × 96 × 2×10⁻³)/(1×10⁵ × 9.11×10⁻³¹ × 3×10⁸).\nNow compute the numerator:\n  1.6×96 ≃ 153.6,\n  153.6×2×10⁻³ = 0.3072×10⁻³ ≃ 3.07×10⁻⁴ (in SI units: C·T·m).\nFor the denominator:\n  (1×10⁵)(9.11×10⁻³¹)(3×10⁸) = 9.11×3×10^(5-31+8)\n    = 27.33×10^( -18) ≃ 2.73×10⁻¹⁷ kg·m/s.\nThus,\n  θ ≃ (3.07×10⁻⁴)/(2.73×10⁻¹⁷) ≃ 1.12×10⁻³ (radians).\nThat is, about 1

It represents the binding due to the strong, short‐range attractive force acting between nearly every pair of nucleons. Since each nucleon interacts with a fixed number of neighbors (in a “bulk” or volume cell), the total binding roughly scales with A.\n\n2. – a₂ A^(2⁄3)  (Surface term):  \n  Nucleons on the surface do not enjoy the full complement of neighboring attractive interactions. Because the surface area of a roughly spherical nucleus scales as A^(2⁄3), one subtracts a term proportional to A^(2⁄3).\n\n3. – a₃ Z² A^(–1⁄3)  (Coulomb term):  \n  Protons repel each other by the Coulomb force. For a uniformly charged sphere the Coulomb energy scales (roughly) as Z² divided by the nuclear radius, and since R ∝ A^(1⁄3) the repulsion energy goes as Z²/A^(1⁄3). This term is subtracted because it reduces the binding.\n\n4. – a₄ (A – 2Z)²/A  (Symmetry term):  \n  Strong interactions are nearly charge independent so the binding is maximized when the numbers of neutrons (N) and protons (Z) are nearly equal. Writing (A – 2Z) = (N – Z), one sees that any asymmetry in the neutron–proton number costs binding energy. The penalty is taken to be proportional to (N – Z)²/A.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Derive a relationship between A and Z for stable, naturally occurring (isobaric) nuclei\n\nFor fixed A the binding energy is a function of Z. The optimum “stable” nucleus is that which maximizes the binding energy. Since only the Coulomb term and the symmetry term depend on Z, we differentiate the Z–dependent part with respect to Z and set the derivative equal to zero.\n\nWrite the Z–dependent part as\n\n  E(Z) = – a₃ Z² A^(–1⁄3) – a₄ (A – 2Z)²/A.\n\nDifferentiate with respect to Z:\n\n  dE/dZ = – 2a₃ Z A^(–1⁄3) – a₄/A [d/dZ (A – 2Z)²].\n\nNow, note that\n  d/dZ (A – 2Z)² = 2 (A – 2Z)(–2) = –4 (A – 2Z).\n\nThus\n\n  dE/dZ = – 2a₃ Z A^(–1⁄3) + (4a₄/A)(A – 2Z).\n\nFor an optimum we set dE/dZ = 0:\n\n  – 2a₃ Z A^(–1⁄3) + (4a₄/A)(A – 2Z) = 0.\n\nMultiplying throughout by A (to remove the factor A^(–1) in the second term):\n\n  – 2a₃ Z A^(2⁄3) + 4a₄ (A – 2Z) = 0.\n\nRearrange this to solve for Z:\n\n  4a₄ (A – 2Z) = 2a₃ Z A^(2⁄3).\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n  2a₄ (A – 2Z) = a₃ Z A^(2⁄3).\n\nExpanding the left side gives\n\n  2a₄ A – 4a₄ Z = a₃ Z A^(2⁄3).\n\nTake all Z–terms to one side:\n\n  2a₄ A = Z (a₃ A^(2⁄3) + 4a₄).\n\nThus the optimum Z satisfies\n\n  Z = (2a₄ A) / (a₃ A^(2⁄3) + 4a₄).\n\nThis shows that for larger A the Coulomb term (which grows as A^(2⁄3)) forces Z to be somewhat less than A/2—in agreement with the observation that heavy nuclei are neutron–rich.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Use a Fermi gas model to estimate the magnitude of a₄\n\nIn the Fermi gas model the nucleons are treated as non–interacting fermions in a potential well (of radius R = R₀A^(1⁄3)) so that they fill momentum states up to a Fermi momentum k_F. In symmetric nuclear matter (equal numbers of neutrons and protons) the density for each species is ρ/2, and one finds\n\n  k_F = [3π² (ρ/2)]^(1/3).\n\nWhen there is an asymmetry, defined by\n\n  δ = (N – Z)/A = (A – 2Z)/A,\n  \nthe Fermi momenta for neutrons and protons shift slightly. A standard expansion (in δ) of the kinetic energy gives a contribution per nucleon\n\n  ΔE_kin/A = (ħ² k_F²)/(6m) δ².\n\nThat is, the extra kinetic energy due to the neutron–proton imbalance is quadratic in δ with a coefficient\n\n  a₄ = ħ² k_F²/(6m).\n\nNow, using typical numbers:  \n  For nuclear matter the density is ρ ≈ 0.16 fm^(–3), and one finds a typical Fermi momentum:  \n    k_F = [3π² (ρ/2)]^(1/3) ≈ 1.33 fm^(–1).\n\nAlso, noting that (ħ²/(2m)) ≈ 20.7 MeV·fm² implies\n  (ħ²/m) ≈ 41.4 MeV·fm².\n\nThus\n\n  a₄ = (41.4 MeV·fm² × (1.33 fm^(–1))²)/(6)\n      ≈ (41.4 × 1.77)/6 MeV\n      ≈ 73.3/6 MeV\n      ≈ 12.2 MeV.\n\nThus, the Fermi gas model gives an estimate a₄ ≈ 12 MeV. (In reality the observed symmetry energy coefficient is larger – roughly 23 MeV – because interactions among nucleons also contribute to the symmetry energy. Here, only the kinetic part is estimated.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n (a) The terms are: \n  • a₁A: volume (bulk) binding from the strong force; \n  • – a₂A^(2⁄3): surface correction because nucleons on the surface have fewer neighbors; \n  • – a₃Z²A^(–1⁄3): Coulomb repulsion between protons; \n  • – a₄(A – 2Z)²/A: symmetry energy penalizing departure from N = Z.  \n   \n (b) For fixed A, minimizing the energy with respect to Z leads to  \n  Z = (2a₄A) / (a₃A^(2⁄3) + 4a₄).  \n   \n (c) In a Fermi gas model the asymmetry energy per nucleon is (ħ²k_F²)/(6m) δ², so one finds  \n  a₄ = ħ²k_F²/(6m) ≈ 12 MeV.\n\nFinal answer in boxed form is\n\n  \\[ \\boxed{ \\text{(a) See explanation above; (b) } Z = \\frac{2a_4 A}{a_3 A^{2/3} + 4a_4} \\text{; (c) } a_4 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar^2k_F^2}{6m} \\approx 12\\,\\text{MeV.} } \\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{(a) See explanation above; (b) } Z = \\frac{2a_4 A}{a_3 A^{2/3} + 4a_4} \\text{; (c) } a_4 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar^2k_F^2}{6m} \\approx 12\\,\\text{MeV.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{(a) See explanation above; (b) } Z = \\frac{2a_4 A}{a_3 A^{2/3} + 4a_4} \\text{; (c) } a_4 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar^2k_F^2}{6m} \\approx 12\\,\\text{MeV.}", "expr2": "Z = \\frac{A}{2 + 0.0154A^{2/3}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{(a) See explanation above; (b) } Z = \\frac{2a_4 A}{a_3 A^{2/3} + 4a_4} \\text{; (c) } a_4 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar^2k_F^2}{6m} \\approx 12\\,\\text{MeV.}", "expr2": "a_{4} \\approx 11 \\text{ MeV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/2-22", "solution": "We wish to put a lower bound on the elastic forward differential cross‐section using only “minimal” principles (namely unitarity and the optical theorem) while neglecting the complications due to the nucleon spins.\n\nLet f(θ) be the scattering amplitude (we are ignoring spin so that f is just a complex number) with the differential cross‐section given by\n\n  dσ/dΩ (θ) = |f(θ)|² .\n\nIn high–energy scattering the optical theorem takes the form\n\n  σₜₒₜ = (4π/p) Im f(0)     (1)\n\nwhere p is the (center–of–mass) momentum and σₜₒₜ is the total cross section (sum of elastic and inelastic). It is an identity that\n\n  |f(0)|² = [Re f(0)]² + [Im f(0)]² ≥ [Im f(0)]² .\n\nThus one immediately deduces\n\n  dσ_el/dΩ (0) = |f(0)|² ≥ [Im f(0)]² .\n\nInserting the optical theorem (1) we find\n\n  [Im f(0)]² = [p σₜₒₜ/(4π)]² .\n\nThat is, we have the bound\n\n  dσ_el/dΩ (0) ≥ (p σₜₒₜ/(4π))² .     (2)\n\nThis is the answer to part (a).\n\nNow, let us understand what goes into this result. The “minimal” assumption is that nothing conspires to produce a forward amplitude with a real part that would “cancel” some of the imaginary part. In other words, the best you can do (for a given total cross section) is to have a purely imaginary amplitude; any nonzero real part only increases |f(0)|². Hence (2) really is a lower bound.\n\nNow, to plug in numbers we note that at p = 10 GeV/c the given total proton–neutron cross section is\n\n  σₜₒₜ = 40 mb.\n\nThus, (2) becomes\n\n  dσ_el/dΩ (0) ≥ [10 GeV/c × 40 mb/(4π)]² .\n\nOne may leave the answer in this form, or convert to appropriate units if needed. (One must be careful with units when converting; in high–energy physics it is common to use natural units where ℏ = c = 1. In these units the result (2) is fully acceptable.)\n\nNow for part (b):\n\nSuppose that an experiment were to find a forward elastic differential cross–section that is smaller than the lower bound (2). Since our derivation of (2) relied only on very general principles (namely, the optical theorem and the trivial inequality |f|² ≥ (Im f)², which in turn follows from unitarity), a violation would indicate that something is amiss. In particular, a measured violation of this bound would mean that one (or more) of the following is true:\n\n1. Some of the fundamental assumptions (such as unitarity or analyticity of the scattering amplitude) are not obeyed in proton–neutron scattering.\n2. Our neglect of the nucleon spin (or other degrees of freedom) is not justified. It could be that the spin–dependence (or other reaction mechanisms) produces interference effects that “reduce” the observed purely elastic forward cross–section below the limit we have derived.\n3. (Less likely) There might be issues with the interpretation of the experimental data or with the classification of “elastic” versus “inelastic” events.\n\nIn short, if such a violation were observed this would signal that our minimal assumptions (which normally are taken to be sacrosanct) do not hold. In practical terms it would be a hint that some new (or unexpected) physics is at work.\n\nWe now summarize our answers.\n\nStep–by–step summary:\n\n1. Using the optical theorem:\n  Im f(0) = (p σₜₒₜ)/(4π).\n\n2. Since |f(0)|² ≥ [Im f(0)]², we have\n  dσ_el/dΩ (0) = |f(0)|² ≥ [p σₜₒₜ/(4π)]².\n\n3. Substituting p = 10 GeV/c and σₜₒₜ = 40 mb gives the lower bound.\n\n4. If an experiment finds a value below this bound, then one or more of the assumptions (unitarity, the optical theorem, or the neglect of spin) must be failing.\n\nThus, our final answers are:\n\n(a) The elastic forward differential cross–section must satisfy\n\n  dσ_el/dΩ (0) ≥ (p σₜₒₜ/(4π))².\n\n(b) If an experiment were to find a differential cross–section below this bound, it would imply that either the basic principles (unitarity/analyticity) used to derive the bound are violated or that the effects of the nucleon spin (or other neglected effects) are non–negligible—in short, something is wrong with our standard picture of proton–neutron scattering.\n\nThe final answers in boxed form are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\frac{d\\sigma_{el}}{d\\Omega}(0) \\ge \\left(\\frac{p\\,\\sigma_{tot}}{4\\pi}\\right)^2, \\quad \\text{so that with } p=10\\,\\text{GeV/c},\\; \\sigma_{tot}=40\\,\\text{mb}; \\\\\n\\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{A measured violation of this bound would indicate either a breakdown of}\\\\\n&\\text{the basic unitarity/analyticity assumptions or the importance of neglected}\\\\\n&\\text{spin (or other) degrees of freedom – i.e. new physics beyond the spinless treatment.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\frac{d\\sigma_{el}}{d\\Omega}(0) \\ge \\left(\\frac{p\\,\\sigma_{tot}}{4\\pi}\\right)^2, \\quad \\text{so that with } p=10\\,\\text{GeV/c},\\; \\sigma_{tot}=40\\,\\text{mb}; \\\\\n\\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{A measured violation of this bound would indicate either a breakdown of}\\\\\n&\\text{the basic unitarity/analyticity assumptions or the importance of neglected}\\\\\n&\\text{spin (or other) degrees of freedom – i.e. new physics beyond the spinless treatment.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\frac{d\\sigma_{el}}{d\\Omega}(0) \\ge \\left(\\frac{p\\,\\sigma_{tot}}{4\\pi}\\right)^2, \\quad \\text{so that with } p=10\\,\\text{GeV/c},\\; \\sigma_{tot}=40\\,\\text{mb}; \\\\\n\\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{A measured violation of this bound would indicate either a breakdown of}\\\\\n&\\text{the basic unitarity/analyticity assumptions or the importance of neglected}\\\\\n&\\text{spin (or other) degrees of freedom – i.e. new physics beyond the spinless treatment.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "2.6 \\, b"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\frac{d\\sigma_{el}}{d\\Omega}(0) \\ge \\left(\\frac{p\\,\\sigma_{tot}}{4\\pi}\\right)^2, \\quad \\text{so that with } p=10\\,\\text{GeV/c},\\; \\sigma_{tot}=40\\,\\text{mb}; \\\\\n\\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\text{A measured violation of this bound would indicate either a breakdown of}\\\\\n&\\text{the basic unitarity/analyticity assumptions or the importance of neglected}\\\\\n&\\text{spin (or other) degrees of freedom – i.e. new physics beyond the spinless treatment.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{Violation of optical theorem and unitarity of } S\\text{-matrix, indicating a breach in the probabilistic interpretation of quantum theory.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Thus, since the ground state of ^81Br has\n  J^π = 3/2^–, T = 11/2, T_z = +11/2,\nthe IAS in ^81Kr will have\n  J^π = 3/2^–, T = 11/2, T_z = +9/2.\n (This clearly is “analog” to the ^81Br state; note that the ^81Kr ground state has T = 9/2, so the IAS is a “high–isospin” excited state.)\n\n (ii) To estimate its excitation energy we note that – apart from the (small) mass–excess difference between ^81Kr and ^81Br – the main energy shift is due to the Coulomb displacement between states of different T. (By comparison with, e.g., the A = 77 multiplet one estimates that the shift between members differing by one unit in T is of order 3 MeV.) Thus one may estimate that the IAS in ^81Kr lies roughly 3 MeV above the ^81Kr ground state.\n\n (iii) One may ask “if the IAS in ^81Kr lies at about 3 MeV excitation, how much decay Q–value is available for the possible decays listed?” A short estimate is as follows. (Here all “masses” are really given in terms of the tabulated mass excesses.)\n\n • Neutron emission: One would need \n  Q_n = ΔM(^81Kr, IAS) – [ΔM(^80Kr) + ΔM(n)].\n  Taking the IAS energy to be the ground state value of ^81Kr plus ~3 MeV, i.e. ΔM_IAS(^81Kr) ≈ –77.65 + 3 = –74.65 MeV, and using ΔM(^80Kr)= –77.90 MeV and ΔM(n)= 8.07 MeV, one finds\n   Q_n ≈ (–74.65) – (–77.90 + 8.07) = (–74.65) – (0. + 8.07 –77.90?) \n  Let us do it step‐by‐step:\n   ΔM(^80Kr) + ΔM(n) = (–77.90 + 8.07) = –69.83 MeV.\n  Then Q_n = (–74.65) – (–69.83) = –4.82 MeV.\n  Thus neutron emission is energetically forbidden.\n\n • γ–decay: The available “decay energy” is just the excitation energy of the IAS,\n  E_γ ≈ 3 MeV,\nso that γ–decay is open.\n\n • α–particle emission: The Q–value would be \n  Q_α = ΔM(^81Kr, IAS) – [ΔM(^77Se) + ΔM(^4He)].\n  Using ΔM(^77Se)= –74.61 MeV and ΔM(^4He)= 2.43 MeV, we have\n   Q_α ≈ (–74.65) – [–74.61 + 2.43] = (–74.65) – (–72.18) = –2.47 MeV.\n  Thus α–emission is also energetically closed.\n\n • β^+–decay: In this “inverse” Fermi transition the IAS in ^81Kr decays to the ^81Br state. One has\n  Q_β+ = ΔM(^81Kr, IAS) – ΔM(^81Br) – (2 m_e c^2).\n  Using ΔM(^81Kr, IAS) ≈ –74.65 MeV, ΔM(^81Br)= –77.98 MeV, and 2 m_e c^2 ≈ 1.022 MeV, one gets\n   Q_β+ ≈ (–74.65 + 77.98 – 1.022) ≈ 2.31 MeV.\n  So β^+–decay is energetically allowed.\n\n (iv) Finally, one may ask what selection rules or other factors might inhibit these decays. In our example:\n  – Neutron and α–emission are energetically forbidden.\n  – The γ–decay of the IAS would have to connect a state of “exotic” isospin T = 11/2 (with J^π = 3/2^–) to the low–T (T = 9/2) ground state of ^81Kr. Besides the sizeable Coulomb barrier which (in any case) inhibits particle decay at such low excitation energy, electromagnetic transitions which “violate” isospin (or occur between states of rather different structure) tend to be inhibited.\n  – By contrast the β^+–decay from the IAS in ^81Kr to the ^81Br ground state is a “Fermi” transition (ΔJ = 0, no parity change) connecting analog states and is super–allowed. (Its rate is then determined essentially by the phase–space available; with Q_β+ ≈ 2.3 MeV, the phase–space is modest, but the intrinsic transition matrix element is large.)\n\nAny answer equivalent

the ^81Br ground state,\n  the IAS has\n   J^π = 3/2^–  T = 11/2  T_z = +9/2.\n (ii) By comparing with typical Coulomb displacement energies (and using, by analogy, the A = 77 multiplet) one estimates that the IAS lies ≈ 3 MeV above the ground state of ^81Kr.\n (iii) Using the tabulated mass excesses and the estimate\n  ΔM(^81Kr,IAS) ≈ –77.65 + 3 = –74.65 MeV, one finds:\n  • For neutron emission: Q_n ≈ (–74.65) – [–77.90 + 8.07] ≈ –4.8 MeV (closed).\n  • For γ–decay:    Q_γ ≈ 3 MeV.\n  • For α–emission:  Q_α ≈ (–74.65) – [–74.61 + 2.43] ≈ –2.5 MeV (closed).\n  • For β^+–decay:   Q_β+ ≈ (–74.65) – (–77.98) – 1.022 ≈ 2.3 MeV.\n (iv) Finally, note that even if enough Q–value were available, the following factors inhibit decay:\n  – γ–decay out of the IAS is hindered by the fact that it must connect a high–isospin (T = 11/2) 3/2^– state to the low–isospin (T = 9/2) ground state, and the electromagnetic multipolarity and resulting small transition matrix elements lead to long

super–allowed Fermi transition (ΔJ = 0, no parity change) connecting analog states, although the limited available energy (≈ 2.3 MeV) does limit the phase space.\n\n────────────────────────────\nThus,

{"id": "atomic/2-3", "solution": "We can analyze the problem in three steps.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Criteria in Selecting a Probe\n\nTo investigate the nuclear size, shape, and density distribution, an ideal probe should have the following properties:\n\n1. Interaction Type and Strength:  \n • It should interact with the nucleus in a well-understood way. For instance, electrons interact electromagnetically (a relatively weak interaction), so their scattering can be interpreted with high precision.  \n • Probes with strong interactions (like protons and neutrons) produce larger cross‐sections but come with complications due to multiple scattering, absorption, and many-body effects.\n\n2. Penetration Ability:  \n • The probe must be able to penetrate the nuclear volume. A probe with too strong an interaction might get stopped or distorted at the nuclear surface, while a probe with too weak an interaction might not “see” deep inside.\n\n3. Momentum Transfer and Resolution:  \n • By adjusting the energy/momentum transfer it’s possible to “image” the nucleus at different length scales. This means that the probe’s wavelength should be comparable to the nuclear size to resolve its structure properly.\n\n4. Minimal Distortion Effects:  \n • A good probe minimizes secondary effects (like reaction mechanisms or final state interactions) so that the relationship between the observed scattering and the intrinsic nuclear properties is straightforward.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Comparison of Electrons, Protons, and Neutrons\n\n1. Electrons:  \n • Advantages:  \n  – Electrons interact via the electromagnetic force, which is well understood and relatively weak, thus minimizing multiple scattering and distortion effects.  \n  – They can be tuned in energy to vary the momentum transfer, allowing high resolution mapping of nuclear charge distributions.  \n • Disadvantages:  \n  – The electromagnetic interaction is relatively weak, so the scattering cross-section is smaller.  \n  – Radiative effects and the need for high luminosity beams can complicate data collection.\n\n2. Protons:  \n • Advantages:  \n  – Protons interact via the strong force, leading to larger scattering cross-sections and thus potentially more sensitivity in some energy regimes.  \n • Disadvantages:  \n  – The strong interaction makes the interpretation of scattering data more complicated due to multiple scattering, absorption, and distorted wave effects.  \n  – Coulomb effects (repulsion) also add complications when probing the charge distribution.\n\n3. Neutrons:  \n • Advantages:  \n  – Being uncharged, neutrons do not experience Coulomb repulsion, and can probe the nuclear interior without the surface distortions introduced by electromagnetic repulsion.  \n  – They are particularly useful in studying the matter (or neutron) distribution in nuclei.  \n • Disadvantages:  \n  – Neutron beams are more difficult to produce and control.  \n  – Like protons, neutrons interact via the strong nuclear force, which complicates the scattering analysis because of the strong and sometimes poorly known reaction mechanisms.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Opinion on Using Photons as Probes\n\nPhotons interact electromagnetically and therefore share some attributes with electrons. Their use as probes has the following considerations:\n\n• Advantages:  \n – Photons, especially high-energy gamma rays, can be used in processes such as Compton scattering and photoabsorption to access information on the nuclear structure.  \n – They do not suffer from some of the complications related to charged particle beam production (such as Coulomb repulsion in the entrance channel).\n\n• Disadvantages and Challenges:  \n – The coupling of photons to the nucleus is different from that of electrons. Often, the interaction involves more complex reaction mechanisms (for example, excitation of giant resonances or meson production) making the extraction of density distributions less straightforward.  \n – The resolution may be limited by the available gamma‐ray energies and the inherent width of nuclear resonances excited by these photons.  \n – Producing intense, monochromatic photon beams with high spatial resolution is experimentally challenging compared to well-established electron beam techniques.\n\nIn conclusion, while photons (gamma-rays) are promising because of their electromagnetic interaction, the inherent experimental challenges and the complex interpretation of the interaction have made electron scattering the preferred method for high precision determination of nuclear charge densities. Photons might complement these studies, especially in exploring specific nuclear excited states and resonance phenomena, but they currently do not offer a straightforward alternative to electrons for mapping the overall nuclear size, shape, and density.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) The ideal probe must clearly interact with the nucleus so that its scattering is interpretable.

The atoms split into discrete beams instead of forming a continuous distribution.  \n• Contribution: This splitting was evidence of the quantization of angular momentum (later associated with the electron's intrinsic spin) and demonstrated that atomic-scale magnetic moments can only take certain discrete orientations. This result played a crucial role in the development of quantum mechanics.\n\n2. Compton Effect (circa 1923)  \n• Description: In this experiment, X-rays were scattered off electrons in a target material. The scattered X-rays exhibited a shift in wavelength compared to the incident X-rays—a phenomenon now known as the Compton shift.  \n• Contribution: This wavelength shift could only be explained by treating light as consisting of particles (photons) with momentum, thereby providing strong evidence for the particle nature of electromagnetic radiation. The Compton effect was one of the key developments that necessitated the revision of classical wave theories of light, contributing significantly to quantum theory.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Stern-Gerlach Experiment (1922): Demonstrated quantization of angular momentum (spin) via discrete deflection of silver atoms. \\quad Compton Effect (1923): Showed photon momentum through wavelength shifts in scattered X-rays, supporting the particle nature of light.}} \\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{Stern-Gerlach Experiment (1922): Demonstrated quantization of angular momentum (spin) via discrete deflection of silver atoms. \\quad Compton Effect (1923): Showed photon momentum through wavelength shifts in scattered X-rays, supporting the particle nature of light.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{Stern-Gerlach Experiment (1922): Demonstrated quantization of angular momentum (spin) via discrete deflection of silver atoms. \\quad Compton Effect (1923): Showed photon momentum through wavelength shifts in scattered X-rays, supporting the particle nature of light.}", "expr2": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) \\textbf{Stern-Gerlach experiment}: Conducted in 1921, it provided evidence for the space }\\\\\n\\text{quantization of angular momentum in atoms by showing beam splitting of silver atoms }\\\\\n\\text{in a non-uniform magnetic field.} \\\\\n\\\\\n\\text{(b) \\textbf{Compton Effect}: Conducted in 1923, it supported Einstein's theory of light quanta. }\\\\\n\\text{Compton discovered wavelength shifts in X-rays scattered by targets, depending on }\\\\\n\\text{scattering angle, implying particle-like properties of photons.}\n\\end{array}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "atomic/2-13", "solution": "We know that the nuclear force is (to a good approximation) charge‐independent; that is, it is nearly invariant under rotations in “isospin space.” Isospin (T) is then a quantum number that classifies nuclear states in much the same way as angular momentum classifies states under rotations in physical space. The value of T is obtained by adding the individual isospins (each nucleon has t = ½) so that the minimum (or “ground state”) isospin is\n\n  T_min = |(N − Z)|/2.\n\nFor N = Z nuclei (where N equals Z), one can have a T = 0 ground state. In addition, states with “non-minimal” isospin (such as T = 1) exist and form, together with states of different third components T₃, isobaric multiplets (for T = 1, a triplet: T₃ = +1, 0, –1).\n\nLet us now look at the two cases in question.\n\n(1) 14N (⁷N₇):  \nHere we have an odd–odd nucleus with 7 protons and 7 neutrons (so T₃ = (7−7)/2 = 0). For odd–odd N = Z nuclei there are two “active” nucleons (an unpaired proton and an unpaired neutron) and these two may couple either to an isoscalar (T = 0) or an isovector (T = 1) configuration. In many cases the T = 0 np pairing is the most attractive, and hence the T = 0 state forms the ground state. However, because the structure (that is, the ordering of levels and the nature of the interaction matrix elements) of odd–odd nuclei often leads to a relatively small splitting between these two coupling schemes, the T = 1 state in 14N lies very near its ground state – here, only about 2.3 MeV above the T = 0 state. Moreover, the members of the T = 1 triplet in the A = 14 system (namely the states in 14C with T₃ = +1, 14N with T₃ = 0, and 14O with T₃ = −1) have very similar intrinsic structures, differing only by Coulomb effects and small isospin‐breaking corrections.\n\n(2) 12C:  \nFor 12C we have an even–even nucleus (6 protons and 6 neutrons, again T₃ = 0). In doubly even nuclei there is the extra binding coming from the pairing of like nucleons into a very stable T = 0 configuration. In this case the lowest state is T = 0 and the structure is well bound by the pairing correlations in the  p‑shell configuration. Exciting the nucleus into a T = 1 state generally requires breaking these “good” pairings (or, equivalently, promoting nucleons into configurations which have a different symmetry structure), and hence a great deal more energy is needed. That is why the lowest T = 1 state in 12C appears at a much higher excitation energy (around 15 MeV) than in 14N.\n\nThus, the marked difference in the excitation energy of the T = 1 states in these nuclei is a reflection of the underlying nuclear structure. In 14N, the two unpaired nucleons already have available coupling schemes (T = 0 or T = 1) that are nearly degenerate, whereas in 12C the T = 0 state is strongly favored by pairing so that a T = 1 excitation must overcome a significant energy gap.\n\nTo summarize the basis for ascribing isospin, we note:\n • Isospin is based on the nearly charge‐independent (or isospin invariant) nature of the nuclear force.\n • The value T is obtained by coupling the individual isospins (t = ½) of the nucleons, where typically T_min = |(N − Z)|/2 for the ground state.\n • States of a given T form multiplets (e.g., a T = 1 triplet with members having T₃ = +1, 0, −1) whose energies are closely related except for shifts from Coulomb (and other isospin-breaking) effects.\n • The systematic behavior of these multiplets across nuclei (for example, in the A = 14 system vs. the A = 12 system) reveals the influence of underlying configuration mixing and pairing effects.\n\nHence, while both 14N and 12C have T = 0 ground states (for N = Z), the low-lying T = 1 state in 14N results from the small energy splitting between the two possible couplings of its unpaired nucleons, whereas in 12C the T = 1 state is high in energy because it requires a significant rearrangement of the stable, paired structure of the even–even nucleus.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{The difference in excitation energy is due to nuclear structure.
