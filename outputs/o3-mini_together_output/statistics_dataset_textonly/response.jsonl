Thermodynamic definition of the Helmholtz free energy:\n  F ≡ U – TS,\nwhere\n  • F is the Helmholtz free energy,\n  • U is the internal energy,\n  • T is the absolute temperature, and\n  • S is the entropy.\n\n2. Statistical mechanical definition of the partition function:\nFor a classical system (which may involve an integration over phase space) or for a discrete system, the partition function is defined as:\n  Z ≡ ∑₍i₎ e^(–βEᵢ),\nor, in the classical phase–space formulation,\n  Z = ∫ dΓ e^(–βH(Γ)),\nwhere\n  • β = 1/(kT) with k the Boltzmann constant,\n  • Eᵢ are the energy eigenvalues (or H(Γ) is the Hamiltonian) and\n  • the sum (or integral) runs over all accessible states.\n\n3. Relationship between F and Z:\nFrom statistical mechanics, one of the key results is that the Helmholtz free energy is given by\n  F = –kT ln Z.\nThus, knowing the partition function Z allows one to calculate F.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Deriving the Expression for cᵥ\n\nWe begin with the relation F = –kT ln Z. Recall also that in equilibrium thermodynamics the internal energy may be recovered from F via\n  U = –T² (∂/∂T)(F/T)              (1)\n\nLet us check this: Write \n  F/T = –k ln Z.\nHence,\n  (∂/∂T)(F/T) = –k (∂ ln Z/∂T)\nso that\n  U = –T² [ –k (∂ ln Z/∂T)] = kT² (∂ ln Z/∂T).     (2)\n\nThe heat capacity at constant volume is defined as\n  c_v = (∂U/∂T)₍V₎.\nDifferentiate (2):\n  c_v = d/dT [kT² (∂ ln Z/∂T)] = k[ 2T (∂ ln Z/∂T) + T² (∂² ln Z/∂T²) ].\n\nNow, notice that the function \n  f(T) = T ln Z\npossesses a derivative\n  f'(T) = ln Z + T (∂ ln Z/∂T)\nand a second derivative\n  f''(T) = (∂ ln Z/∂T) + (∂ ln Z/∂T) + T (∂² ln Z/∂T²) = 2 (∂ ln Z/∂T) + T (∂² ln Z/∂T²).\n\nThus, we can write the heat capacity as\n  c_v = kT [2 (∂ ln Z/∂T) + T (∂² ln Z/∂T²)] = kT f''(T).\n\nIn other words,\n  c_v = kT [∂²/∂T² (T ln Z)]₍V₎,\nwhich is the desired result.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Two-State System\n\nNow consider a classical system that can reside in one of two total energy states: E₀ and E₁. Then the partition function is\n  Z = e^(–βE₀) + e^(–βE₁).\n\nIt is convenient to factor out one common exponential. Let Δ = E₁ – E₀. Then\n  Z = e^(–βE₀)[1 + e^(–βΔ)].\n\nSince only differences in energy matter, sometimes one may choose E₀ = 0 so that\n  Z = 1 + e^(–βΔ).\nHowever, we will keep E₀ to show the general dependence.\n\nTo find the internal energy U and then c_v, there are several routes. One common method is through energy fluctuations:\n  U = ⟨E⟩ = (E₀ e^(–βE₀) + E₁ e^(–βE₁)) / Z\nand it is a standard result that\n  c_v = kβ² (⟨E²⟩ – ⟨E⟩²).\n\nA more straightforward method is to differentiate U = kT² (∂ ln Z/∂T) with respect to T. However, the fluctuations method typically leads to a compact final result.\n\nLet us quickly compute the necessary averages. It is useful to re-write the partition function in the form:\n  Z = e^(–βE₀) [1 + e^(–βΔ)].\nThen\n  ln Z = –βE₀ + ln[1 + e^(–βΔ)].\nNotice that the first term, –βE₀, gives a part T·(–βE₀)= –E₀/k which is independent of T once multiplied by T. Hence, all T–dependence is contained in the second term.\n\nFor the heat capacity it is easier, though, to compute the variance. Identify the probability of state i as\n  p₀ = e^(–βE₀)/Z  and  p₁ = e^(–βE₁)/Z.\nThen the mean energy is\n  ⟨E⟩ = E₀ p₀ + E₁ p₁,\nand the second moment is\n  ⟨E²⟩ = E₀² p₀ + E₁² p₁.\nA short calculation shows that the fluctuation is\n  ⟨E²⟩ – ⟨E⟩² = Δ² · [ e^(–βΔ) / (1 + e^(–βΔ))² ].\n\nThus, by the fluctuation formula\n  c_v = kβ² (⟨E²⟩ – ⟨E⟩²) = kβ² Δ² · [ e^(–βΔ) / (1 + e^(–βΔ))² ].\nRecalling that β = 1/(kT) we can write\n  c_v = k (Δ/(kT))² · [ e^(–Δ/(kT)) / (1 + e^(–Δ/(kT)))² ].\n\nThis is the desired result for the heat capacity of a two–state system.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The Helmholtz free energy is defined by\n  F = U – TS,\nand the partition function is given by\n  Z = ∑₍i₎ e^(–βEᵢ)  (with β = 1/(kT)). The two are related by\n  F = –kT ln Z.\n\n(b) Using F = –kT ln Z and thermodynamic relations, one shows that\n  c_v = kT [∂²/∂T² (T ln Z)]₍V₎.\n\n(c) For a system with energy levels E₀ and E₁ (with Δ = E₁ – E₀) the partition function is\n  Z = e^(–βE₀) + e^(–βE₁) = e^(–βE₀)[1 + e^(–βΔ)],\nand the heat capacity is\n  c_v = k (Δ/(kT))² · [ e^(–Δ/(kT)) / (1 + e^(–Δ/(kT)))² ].\n\nThus, the final answers are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &F = U - TS,\\quad Z = \\sum_i e^{-\\beta E_i}\\quad (\\beta = 1/(kT)),\\quad \\text{and}\\quad F = -kT\\ln Z.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &c_v = kT \\left[\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial T^2}(T\\ln Z)\\right]_V.\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &Z = e^{-\\beta E_0}\\left(1+e^{-\\beta\\Delta}\\right),\\quad \\text{with }\\Delta = E_1-E_0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad c_v = k\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{kT}\\right)^2\\frac{e^{-\\Delta/(kT)}}{\\left(1+e^{-\\Delta/(kT)}\\right)^2}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &F = U - TS,\\quad Z = \\sum_i e^{-\\beta E_i}\\quad (\\beta = 1/(kT)),\\quad \\text{and}\\quad F = -kT\\ln Z.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &c_v = kT \\left[\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial T^2}(T\\ln Z)\\right]_V.\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &Z = e^{-\\beta E_0}\\left(1+e^{-\\beta\\Delta}\\right),\\quad \\text{with }\\Delta = E_1-E_0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad c_v = k\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{kT}\\right)^2\\frac{e^{-\\Delta/(kT)}}{\\left(1+e^{-\\Delta/(kT)}\\right)^2}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &F = U - TS,\\quad Z = \\sum_i e^{-\\beta E_i}\\quad (\\beta = 1/(kT)),\\quad \\text{and}\\quad F = -kT\\ln Z.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &c_v = kT \\left[\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial T^2}(T\\ln Z)\\right]_V.\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &Z = e^{-\\beta E_0}\\left(1+e^{-\\beta\\Delta}\\right),\\quad \\text{with }\\Delta = E_1-E_0,\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad c_v = k\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{kT}\\right)^2\\frac{e^{-\\Delta/(kT)}}{\\left(1+e^{-\\Delta/(kT)}\\right)^2}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "F = -kT \\ln Z"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "statistics/1-120", "solution": "We will show that when 60 cal of heat is added to a “triple‐point” mixture of 1 g ice, 1 g water, and 1 g water‐vapor in a rigid (“constant–volume”) cell – and noting that the almost “all” of the available volume is taken up by the vapor – the only “room” the heat has to go is into changing the “phase fractions” without raising the temperature (and pressure) above the triple–point values. In our problem the “triple point” is at 0.01°C and 4.58 mm Hg (≈610 Pa). (Indeed, when the three phases occur the temperature and pressure are fixed. Even if the relative amounts change, the intensive variables remain constant until one of the phases is completely used up.) \n\nBecause the liquid and solid both have nearly the same (small) specific volumes, almost all of the cell’s volume is occupied by the vapor. (A short calculation using the ideal–gas law shows that if the 1 g of water‐vapor present initially is at T = 273.16 K and p = 610 Pa, then the volume of the cell is of order 0.21 m³.) Therefore, in order for the water–vapor portion of the system to continue “filling” the cell at the fixed vapor–pressure (i.e. for the vapor to be saturated) its amount must remain essentially fixed. (That is, if some vapor were to “disappear” the saturation pressure would no longer be produced in the huge cell.) \n\nThus, if we add 60 cal from the outside we cannot “heat up” the vapor appreciably (nor can we vaporize more water) because then the vapor pressure would become too high for the given cell volume. The only way for the system to absorb the additional energy is for the latent–heat work associated with the solid–liquid conversion to change the phase–fractions while keeping the temperature (and the vapor pressure) fixed at the triple–point values. \n\nNow, recall that at the triple point all three phases are in equilibrium at T = 0.01°C. (In a three–phase equilibrium the “intensive” variables are fixed while the “extensive” amounts may change.) And note that to convert ice to water at 0.01°C 80 cal of heat per gram must be absorbed (this is the latent heat of fusion, L_f). Thus if we “melt” part of the ice at T = 0.01°C the energy uptake is\n\n  (heat used to melt ice) = 80 cal/g × (mass melted).\n\nMoreover, in the laboratory “triple–point cell” the amount of vapor (and hence its volume) is forced by the cell’s volume to be 1.00 g (to within a percent or so). (A short calculation using pV = nRT shows that if one has 1.00 g of water vapor at T = 273.16 K the volume is about V = (nRT)/p, which with n = 1/18 moles and p = 610 Pa gives V ≈ 0.21 m³.) \n\nThus, if we are to remain at the triple–point (that is, to keep water and vapor in saturation at 0.01°C and 610 Pa) we cannot “borrow” heat from any phase‐change between liquid and vapor. (In other words, if one tried to condense a little vapor (with its very large latent heat of 596 cal/g) then there would no longer be enough vapor to “fill” the container at the needed saturated pressure.) \n\nThe only permissible process is then to melt some of the ice. Since we add 60 cal externally the mass of ice that melts is\n\n  m_melted = (60 cal)/(80 cal/g) = 0.75 g.\n\nIn the final state the 1 g of ice is reduced by 0.75 g (melted) so that only\n\n  m_ice(final) = 1.00 – 0.75 = 0.25 g\n\nof solid remains. (There is no free extra energy to “raise” the temperature above 0.01°C, and we are not allowed to “use” any vapor–liquid conversion because the huge volume fixes the vapor mass to nearly 1.00 g.) Meanwhile, the water phase now contains not only the 1 g that was there originally but also the 0.75 g coming from the melted ice. (One might wonder “what about the water that is already present?” It is still there.) Hence the water mass is\n\n  m_water(final) = 1.00 + 0.75 = 1.75 g.\n\nAnd the water–vapor phase must still contain 1 g of vapor so that the vapor has its proper density in the cell:\n\n  m_vapor(final) ≈ 1.00 g.\n\nThus, to within a couple of per‐cent (our approximations – such as neglect of the small sensible increases – are well within the 2% tolerance) the final masses are\n\n • Ice:   approximately 0.25 g \n • Water:  approximately 1.75 g \n • Vapor:  approximately 1.00 g\n\nIn summary, the extra 60 cal go entirely into melting 0.75 g of ice (since 0.75 g × 80 cal/g = 60 cal) while the vapor mass is “pinned” by the fixed cell volume (which, for a nearly ideal gas at 0.01°C and 610 Pa, requires nearly 1 g of vapor). This is why the only change is that nearly ¾ gram of the ice converts to water.\n\nFinally, we write the answer in boxed LaTeX form:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{m_{\\rm ice}\\approx0.25\\,\\text{g},\\quad m_{\\rm water}\\approx1.75\\,\\text{g},\\quad m_{\\rm vapor}\\approx1.00\\,\\text{g}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["m_{\\rm ice}\\approx0.25\\,\\text{g},\\quad m_{\\rm water}\\approx1.75\\,\\text{g},\\quad m_{\\rm vapor}\\approx1.00\\,\\text{g}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "m_{\\rm ice}\\approx0.25\\,\\text{g},\\quad m_{\\rm water}\\approx1.75\\,\\text{g},\\quad m_{\\rm vapor}\\approx1.00\\,\\text{g}", "expr2": "x = 0.25 \\ \\text{g}, \\ y = 1.75 \\ \\text{g}, \\ z = 1.00 \\ \\text{g}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

We now describe one way to arrive at the answer.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Writing the Entropy Differential\n\nWhen H and T are taken as the independent variables the entropy S = S(T,H) has the differential\n  dS = (∂S/∂T)ₕ dT + (∂S/∂H)ₜ dH.\nNow, by definition the heat capacity at constant field is\n  c_H = T (∂S/∂T)ₕ ⟹ (∂S/∂T)ₕ = c_H/T = b/T³.\nFurthermore, one may use a Maxwell relation that (when the work is written in the standard “magnetic Gibbs” form) gives\n  (∂S/∂H)ₜ = – (∂M/∂T)ₕ.\nSince M = (aH)/T we have\n  (∂M/∂T)ₕ = – aH/T² ⟹ (∂S/∂H)ₜ = aH/T².\nThus the full differential is\n  dS = (b/T³)dT + (aH/T²)dH.\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Using the Adiabatic Condition\n\nA reversible adiabatic (isentropic) process has no change in entropy, that is, dS = 0. Hence\n  (b/T³)dT + (aH/T²)dH = 0.\nIt is convenient to write this as\n  (b/T³)dT = – (aH/T²)dH  ⟹  dT/T = – (aH/b) dH.\n(Notice that when a < 0 – which is the usual situation for a paramagnet – the derivative dT/dH is negative; then when H is reduced, dH < 0, making dT > 0 or dT < 0 as appropriate for cooling or heating. In what follows, you may think of a as being negative so that removal of the field cools the system.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Integration\n\nSeparate the variables:\n  dT/T = – (aH/b) dH.\nIntegrate from the initial state, when T = Tᵢ and H = Hᵢ, to the final state, when T = T_f (with H = 0):\n  ∫₍Tᵢ₎⁽T_f⁾ (dT/T) = – (a/b) ∫₍Hᵢ₎⁰ H dH.\nThe integrals are elementary:\n  ln(T_f/Tᵢ) = – (a/b) [(0² – Hᵢ²)/2] = (aHᵢ²)/(2b).\nThus, the relation between the final and initial temperatures is\n  T_f = Tᵢ exp (aHᵢ²/(2b)).\nAgain, if a is negative (the usual case) then T_f is less than Tᵢ, so adiabatic demagnetization cools the system.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Choosing Hᵢ so that the Temperature Changes by a Factor of 2\n\nSuppose we wish the final temperature to be one‐half of the initial temperature, i.e.\n  T_f = Tᵢ/2.\nThen our integrated result requires\n  Tᵢ/2 = Tᵢ exp (aHᵢ²/(2b)).\nDivide both sides by Tᵢ and take natural logarithms:\n  ln(1/2) = (aHᵢ²)/(2b).\nThat is,\n  aHᵢ²/(2b) = – ln 2.\nWhen solving for Hᵢ, it is better to express the answer in terms of the absolute value |a| (because for a normal paramagnet a is negative).

In other words,\n  ∂cₓ/∂x = 2A (x/l₀ – l₀²/x²).\nThis ordinary differential equation in x (at fixed T) may be integrated. Write\n  cₓ(x,T) = cₓ(l₀,T) + 2A ∫ₓ₌ₗ₀ˣ (x′/l₀ – l₀²/x′²) dx′.\nBut we are given that when x = l₀, cₓ(l₀,T) = K (a constant independent of T). Now compute the integral:\n  I = ∫ₓ₌ₗ₀ˣ (x′/l₀) dx′ – ∫ₓ₌ₗ₀ˣ (l₀²/x′²) dx′.\nThe first term:\n  ∫ (x′/l₀) dx′ = x′²/(2l₀),\nso its contribution is [x² – l₀²]/(2l₀).\nThe second:\n  ∫ (l₀²/x′²) dx′ = – l₀²/x′,\nso its contribution is – [–l₀²/x + l₀²/l₀] = l₀²(1/x – 1/l₀).\nThus,\n  cₓ(x,T) = K + 2A { [x² – l₀²]/(2l₀) + l₀² (1/x – 1/l₀) }.\nCancel the “2” in the first term:\n  cₓ(x,T) = K + A[(x² – l₀²)/l₀] + 2A l₀² (1/x – 1/l₀).  (Answer 3)\n\nOne may check that at x = l₀ the extra terms vanish.\n\n────────────────────────────\n(a)(4) Find E(x,T)\n\nSince cₓ(x,T) = (∂E/∂T)_ₓ is found in (3) and we see that this answer does not depend on T explicitly (aside from the overall T–derivative) we conclude that at fixed x the energy is linear in T. Thus, one may write in general\n  E(x,T)= T · cₓ(x) + f(x),\nwhere f(x) is a function of x only. But now recall the thermodynamic relation (7):\n  (∂E/∂x)_T = T (∂S/∂x)_T + t.\nWe already computed (∂E/∂x)_T in (1) and we know t is proportional to T. From the equality of the mixed derivatives (that we already used in (2)) one can show that in fact f′(x)= 0 so that we may choose f(x)= 0 (i.e. our zero of energy is arbitrary). For example, one may choose to define E(l₀,T)= T·K so that\n  E(x,T)= T { K + A[(x²–l₀²)/l₀] + 2A l₀²(1/x – 1/l₀) }.  (Answer 4)\n\n────────────────────────────\n(a)(5) Find S(x,T)\n\nThere are several ways to obtain the entropy. One simple method is to start from the fundamental relation (6)\n  dE = T dS + t dx.\nThen, at fixed x we have dE = cₓ(x,T) dT so that\n  (∂S/∂T)_ₓ = (1/T) (∂E/∂T)_ₓ = cₓ(x)/T.\nThus, by integration with respect to T (at fixed x) one obtains\n  S(x,T) = cₓ(x) ln T + g(x),\nwhere g(x) is an arbitrary function of x. To determine g(x) we use the Maxwell relation (8) which tells us that\n  (∂S/∂x)_T = – (∂t/∂T)_ₓ.\nWe already computed t in (1) so that\n  (∂t/∂T)_ₓ = A (x/l₀ – l₀²/x²).\nOn the other hand, differentiating our expression for S we have\n  (∂S/∂x)_T = (dcₓ/dx) ln T + g′(x).\nBut from (a)(2) we already found\n  dcₓ/dx = 2A (x/l₀ – l₀²/x²).\nThus, in order that (∂S/∂x)_T be independent of T we must choose g(x) so that the lnT–terms cancel. In other words, we write the entropy “at the natural length” (x = l₀) as a function of T. Since we already know that when x = l₀, cₓ(l₀,T)= K, a natural choice is\n  S(l₀,T)= K ln T   (where we set the additive constant zero).\nThen, we integrate (∂S/∂x)_T directly using an alternative method. In fact, returning to the fundamental relation (6) one may eliminate T by writing\n  (∂S/∂x)_T = (1/T)[(∂E/∂x)_T – t].\nBut (from (1) and (a)(1))\n  (∂E/∂x)_T = 2A T (x/l₀ – l₀²/x²)  and  t = A T (x/l₀ – l₀²/x²),\nso that\n  (∂S/∂x)_T = A (x/l₀ – l₀²/x²).\nThen upon integration\n  S(x,T) = S(l₀,T) + A∫ₗ₀ˣ (x′/l₀ – l₀²/x′²) dx′.\nWe have already evaluated this integral in (a)(3). Hence,\n  S(x,T) = K ln T + A { (x² – l₀²)/(2l₀) + l₀² (1/x – 1/l₀) }.  (Answer 5)\n\n────────────────────────────\nPart (b): Adiabatic Stretching\n\nAn adiabatic process is by definition one in which no heat is exchanged so that the entropy remains constant. Suppose that the band is slowly (so that equilibrium is maintained) stretched adiabatically from x = l₀ to x = 1.5l₀. (The initial temperature is T₀.)\n\nAt x = l₀ the entropy is, from (Answer 5),\n  S(l₀,T₀)= K ln T₀ + A { (l₀²–l₀²)/(2l₀) + l₀² (1/l₀– 1/l₀) } = K ln T₀.\nAt x = 1.5l₀, the entropy is\n  S(1.5l₀,T_f) = K ln T_f + A { ((1.5l₀)² – l₀²)/(2l₀) + l₀² (1/(1.5l₀) – 1/l₀) }.\nLet us simplify the bracketed expression.

{"id": "statistics/1-48", "solution": "We wish to analyze a reversed Carnot cycle operating as a refrigerator (or “heat pump” in cooling mode) which removes heat from a low‐temperature reservoir (at 0°C, where water is frozen) and rejects heat into a high‐temperature reservoir (water at 20°C). The analysis is done first by describing the cycle with its processes, then by using the Carnot refrigerator performance to determine the minimum work required to freeze 3 kg of water.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Description of the Cycle\n\nA reversed Carnot cycle consists of four reversible processes:\n\n1. Isothermal “Evaporation” (Process 1–2):  \n  At the low temperature Tₗ = 273 K (0°C), the working substance absorbs heat Qₗ from the fluid (or from the system to be cooled—in our case the water being frozen). On a p–v diagram this process appears as a smooth curve at constant temperature (the vaporization or “evaporation” process in the refrigerant) during which it expands; on an h–s (enthalpy–entropy) diagram, this step appears as a horizontal line (since the temperature remains constant and any heat addition increases the entropy).\n\n2. Adiabatic (Isentropic) Compression (Process 2–3):  \n  The working substance is compressed without heat exchange from Tₗ = 273 K to Tₕ = 293 K (20°C). On a p–v diagram this is seen as a steep curve (with no heat transfer) from a lower to a higher pressure. In the h–s diagram, this is a vertical upward line (constant entropy).\n\n3. Isothermal “Condensation” (Process 3–4):  \n  At the higher temperature Tₕ = 293 K, the working substance rejects the absorbed heat Qₕ to the water tank. On the p–v diagram, the process is a smooth curve at constant temperature (with contraction). On the h–s diagram, it appears again as a horizontal line (the loss of heat decreases the entropy).\n\n4. Adiabatic (Isentropic) Expansion (Process 4–1):  \n  Finally, the working substance is expanded adiabatically from Tₕ = 293 K back to Tₗ = 273 K. On the p–v diagram, this is the reverse of the adiabatic compression and appears as a vertical (no heat transfer) curve. On the h–s diagram, the process is represented by a vertical line downward (entropy is constant).\n\nThus, the complete cycle in the p–v plane looks roughly like a closed loop where the two isothermal curves (at Tₗ and Tₕ) are connected by the two adiabatic curves. In the h–s diagram the cycle appears as a rectangle with horizontal sides (heat transfer) and vertical sides (adiabatic processes).\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Refrigeration Performance and Energy Requirement\n\nFor a Carnot refrigerator, the coefficient of performance (COP) is given by\n\n  COP_R = Qₗ/W = Tₗ/(Tₕ − Tₗ)\n\nHere, Tₗ = 273 K and Tₕ = 293 K. Hence,\n\n  COP_R = 273/(293 − 273) = 273/20 ≈ 13.65\n\nWhen freezing water, the important energy removal is the latent heat of fusion. For water the latent heat L_f is approximately 333 kJ/kg. For 3 kg of water,\n\n  Qₗ = 3 × 333,000 J = 999,000 J ≈ 1.0×10⁶ J\n\nBecause by definition the refrigerator’s work input is related to the extracted heat by\n\n  W = Qₗ/COP_R\n\nwe obtain\n\n  W = 999,000 J/13.65 ≈ 73,260 J\n\nThus, the minimum work required is roughly 73 kJ.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nIn summary, the reversed Carnot cycle (operating as a refrigerator) absorbs heat isothermally at 0°C (process 1–2), isentropically compresses to 20°C (process 2–3), rejects heat isothermally at 20°C (process 3–4), and then isentropically expands back to 0°C (process 4–1). On a p–v diagram these appear as two isothermal curves (for heat absorption and rejection) linked by two adiabatic curves, and on an h–s diagram the isothermal processes appear as horizontal lines (with the adiabatic processes vertical). Using the Carnot COP, COP_R = 273/20 ≈ 13.65, the work needed to remove about 1.0×10⁶ J of latent heat (to freeze 3 kg of water) is approximately 73 kJ.\n\n  \\[ \\boxed{W \\approx 7.3 \\times 10^4\\ \\text{J}} \\]", "final_answers": ["W \\approx 7.3 \\times 10^4\\ \\text{J}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "W \\approx 7.3 \\times 10^4\\ \\text{J}", "expr2": "W = 73.4 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{J}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

For an ideal (Carnot) refrigerator operating between a cold reservoir at T_C and a hot reservoir at T_H, the COP is given by\n\n  COP = T_C / (T_H – T_C),\n\nwhere the temperatures are in Kelvin.

In this context the pump uses mechanical power W (in watts) to transfer heat from the atmosphere into the building.

Single Particle Partition Function\n\nFor a single particle we have:\n  Z₁ = (1/h³) ∫d³q ∫d³p exp(–β ε(p)).\nSince the particles are free, the coordinate integral simply gives the volume V:\n  Z₁ = V/h³ · ∫d³p exp(–β c|p|).\n\nWrite the momentum integral in spherical coordinates. With d³p = 4π p² dp and ε = c p one obtains\n  ∫d³p exp(–β c p) = 4π∫₀∞ p² e^(–β c p) dp.\n\nRecall that\n  ∫₀∞ p² e^(–α p) dp = 2/α³.\nThus, with α = β c,\n  ∫d³p exp(–β c p) = 4π (2/(β c)³) = 8π/(β c)³.\n\nSo the single‐particle partition function becomes\n\n  Z₁ = V/h³ · 8π/(β c)³.\n\nSince β = 1/(kT) we may write:\n\n  Z₁ = V · 8π/(h³) · (kT/c)³.\n\nIt is sometimes useful to express Z₁ in the form\n\n  Z₁ = V · 8π (kT)³/(h³ c³).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Total Partition Function and Pressure\n\nFor N indistinguishable particles the total partition function is\n\n  Z = Z₁^N / N!.\nTaking the logarithm we have\n\n  ln Z = N ln Z₁ – ln N!.\nUsing Stirling’s approximation ln N! ≈ N ln N – N for large N, we write\n\n  ln Z ≈ N ln Z₁ – N ln N + N.\n\nNow, using the thermodynamic relation for the pressure in the canonical ensemble:\n  P = kT (∂ ln Z/∂V) (with T and N fixed),\nwe note that the only V–dependent term in ln Z comes from ln Z₁. Since\n  Z₁ = V · [8π (kT)³/(h³ c³)],\nthen\n  ln Z₁ = ln V + constant (terms independent of V).\nThus\n\n  ∂ ln Z/∂V = N/V,\nand hence,\n\n  P = kT (N/V) = NkT/V.\n\nSo we obtain the familiar ideal–gas equation of state.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Internal Energy and Specific Heat\n\nThe internal energy is given by\n  U = –∂ ln Z/∂β.\nRecall that for the single particle,\n  Z₁ = V · 8π/(h³) · 1/(β c)³,\nso that\n  ln Z₁ = ln V + ln (8π/(h³)) – 3 ln (β c).\nThus, for N particles (neglecting the lnN! term which is independent of β),\n  ln Z = N [ln V + ln (8π/(h³)) – 3 ln (β c)] – ln N!.\nTaking the derivative with respect to β:\n\n  ∂ ln Z/∂β = –3N/β       (since d(ln (β c))/dβ = 1/β).\n\nTherefore,\n  U = –(∂ ln Z/∂β) = 3N/β = 3NkT.\nThus the energy per particle is 3kT.\n\nThe specific heat at constant volume is then\n  C_V = (∂U/∂T)_V = 3Nk.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Entropy\n\nOne way to obtain the entropy is to use\n\n  S = k ln Z + U/T.\nWe already have\n  ln Z ≈ N ln Z₁ – (N ln N – N),\nor\n  ln Z ≈ N ln V + N ln(8π/(h³)) – 3N ln(β c) – N ln N + N.\nSubstitute β = 1/(kT):\n  ln Z ≈ N ln V + N ln(8π/(h³)) + 3N ln(kT/c) – N ln N + N.\nThen,\n  S = k ln Z + 3Nk.\nIt is useful to combine the terms to write the entropy per particle in a Sackur–Tetrode–like form. Grouping the terms we get\n\n  S = Nk [ ln(V/N) + ln(8π/(h³)) + 3 ln(kT/c) + 1 + 3 ].\n\nOften we include the constant as part of the overall additive constant. Hence a common way to write the result is\n\n  S = Nk { ln[(V/N)·8π (kT)³/(h³ c³)] + 4 }.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\nThus, for an ideal Boltzmann gas of indistinguishable particles in the extreme relativistic limit (where ε = cp), we have:\n\n1.

{"id": "statistics/2-66", "solution": "We will answer the question in two parts.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 1. (a) Defining the one‐particle density matrix in the r-representation\n\nIn quantum statistical mechanics the (reduced) one‐particle density matrix is defined as the coordinate–space matrix elements of the one–particle density operator. In other words, if ρ^(1) denotes the one–particle density operator then in the position basis one writes\n\n  ρ₁(r, r′) = ⟨r|ρ^(1)|r′⟩ .\n\nA common way to express this is in terms of the field operators Ψ and Ψ†. Namely, one may define\n\n  ρ₁(r, r′) = ⟨Ψ†(r′) Ψ(r)⟩ .\n\nThis quantity contains all information about one–particle correlations in the system; in particular, in the diagonal case r = r′ the density ρ(r)=⟨Ψ†(r)Ψ(r)⟩ is recovered.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 2. (b) Behavior of ρ₁(r) for free bosons as T passes through T_c\n\nFor a system of N free bosons the one–body density matrix is given (in the homogeneous case) by\n\n  ρ₁(r) = (1/V) Σₖ ⟨Nₖ⟩ e^(i k · r),\n\nwhere ⟨Nₖ⟩ is the average occupation number of the momentum state k. Let us split the discussion into two temperature regimes.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nCase 1. Temperature T > T_c (Normal phase)\n\nWhen T is above the Bose–Einstein condensation temperature T_c the occupation numbers ⟨Nₖ⟩ are all “small” in the sense that no single state is macroscopically occupied. In the sum above all terms (with various phases e^(i k · r)) contribute and for large r these complex exponentials oscillate rapidly. Consequently, when summed over the continuum of k–states the phases destructively interfere so that\n\n  lim₍r → ∞₎ ρ₁(r) = 0.\n\nA more detailed analysis (by replacing the sum by an integral and performing a saddle–point evaluation) shows that above T_c the decay of ρ₁(r) is essentially exponential for large r with a decay length on the order of the thermal de Broglie wavelength. (In some interacting systems or in low dimensions one may instead find power–law decay but for the case of the non–interacting, three-dimensional free boson gas one obtains an exponential fall–off.)\n\n───────────────────────────── \nCase 2. Temperature T < T_c (Bose–condensed phase)\n\nWhen the temperature drops below T_c, a macroscopic number of particles condenses into the lowest momentum state (k = 0). One then separates the term k = 0 from the sum:\n\n  ρ₁(r) = (1/V) ⟨N₀⟩ + (1/V) Σₖ≠₀ ⟨Nₖ⟩ e^(i k · r).\n\nBecause ⟨N₀⟩ grows macroscopically (∼N) it turns out that the first term is non–zero in the thermodynamic limit. As r → ∞, the oscillatory contributions in the second term cancel, and one finds\n\n  lim₍r → ∞₎ ρ₁(r) = n₀    (n₀ = condensate density = N₀/V).\n\nThis non–zero asymptotic value of ρ₁(r) at long distances is the celebrated manifestation of off–diagonal long–range order in a Bose–Einstein condensed system.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nSummary of the Limiting Behaviors\n\n• For T > T_c: The one–particle density matrix decays to zero for large r. In fact, the contributions from the excited (thermal) states yield an approximately exponential decay, ρ₁(r) ∼ exp(–r/ξ), with ξ a thermal correlation length of order the thermal de Broglie wavelength.\n\n• For T < T_c: The k = 0 (condensate) term contributes a constant n₀ (with n₀ > 0) so that ρ₁(r) approaches n₀ as r → ∞, even though the contributions from the excited states still decay.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer\n\n(a) In quantum statistical mechanics the one–particle density matrix in the r–representation is defined as\n\n  ρ₁(r, r′) = ⟨r|ρ^(1)|r′⟩ = ⟨Ψ†(r′)Ψ(r)⟩.\n\n(b) For a system of N identical free bosons one may write\n\n  ρ₁(r) = (1/V) Σₖ ⟨Nₖ⟩ e^(i k · r).\n\nWhen T > T_c, no state is macroscopically occupied and the contributions from different k modes interfere destructively so that ρ₁(r) → 0 at large r (with the decay being essentially exponential, characterized by the thermal de Broglie wavelength). When T < T_c a macroscopic fraction of particles condenses into the k = 0 mode, so that ρ₁(r) → n₀ = ⟨N₀⟩/V > 0 as r → ∞, signaling the onset of off–diagonal long–range order.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer in LaTeX\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} \\quad &\\rho_1(r,r') = \\langle r|\\hat{\\rho}^{(1)}|r'\\rangle = \\langle \\Psi^\\dagger(r') \\Psi(r) \\rangle. \\\\\n\\text{(b)} \\quad &\\rho_1(r) = \\frac{1}{V}\\sum_k \\langle N_k \\rangle e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot \\mathbf{r}}. \\\\\n&\\text{For } T > T_c,\\, \\rho_1(r)\\to 0 \\text{ as } r\\to\\infty \\text{ (decaying roughly as } e^{-r/\\xi}\\text{), while for } T < T_c,\\, \\rho_1(r)\\to \\frac{\\langle N_0 \\rangle}{V} > 0.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} \\quad &\\rho_1(r,r') = \\langle r|\\hat{\\rho}^{(1)}|r'\\rangle = \\langle \\Psi^\\dagger(r') \\Psi(r) \\rangle. \\\\\n\\text{(b)} \\quad &\\rho_1(r) = \\frac{1}{V}\\sum_k \\langle N_k \\rangle e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot \\mathbf{r}}. \\\\\n&\\text{For } T > T_c,\\, \\rho_1(r)\\to 0 \\text{ as } r\\to\\infty \\text{ (decaying roughly as } e^{-r/\\xi}\\text{), while for } T < T_c,\\, \\rho_1(r)\\to \\frac{\\langle N_0 \\rangle}{V} > 0.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} \\quad &\\rho_1(r,r') = \\langle r|\\hat{\\rho}^{(1)}|r'\\rangle = \\langle \\Psi^\\dagger(r') \\Psi(r) \\rangle. \\\\\n\\text{(b)} \\quad &\\rho_1(r) = \\frac{1}{V}\\sum_k \\langle N_k \\rangle e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot \\mathbf{r}}. \\\\\n&\\text{For } T > T_c,\\, \\rho_1(r)\\to 0 \\text{ as } r\\to\\infty \\text{ (decaying roughly as } e^{-r/\\xi}\\text{), while for } T < T_c,\\, \\rho_1(r)\\to \\frac{\\langle N_0 \\rangle}{V} > 0.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\langle r | \\rho | r' \\rangle = \\sum_E \\varphi_E(r) e^{-E/k_B T} \\varphi_E^*(r')"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} \\quad &\\rho_1(r,r') = \\langle r|\\hat{\\rho}^{(1)}|r'\\rangle = \\langle \\Psi^\\dagger(r') \\Psi(r) \\rangle. \\\\\n\\text{(b)} \\quad &\\rho_1(r) = \\frac{1}{V}\\sum_k \\langle N_k \\rangle e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot \\mathbf{r}}. \\\\\n&\\text{For } T > T_c,\\, \\rho_1(r)\\to 0 \\text{ as } r\\to\\infty \\text{ (decaying roughly as } e^{-r/\\xi}\\text{), while for } T < T_c,\\, \\rho_1(r)\\to \\frac{\\langle N_0 \\rangle}{V} > 0.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\rho_1(r) \\approx \\frac{m k_B T_c}{2\\pi \\hbar^2} \\frac{1}{r}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "statistics/2-119", "solution": "We can understand the cooling process by looking at how the equilibrium between liquid and solid He³ shifts under pressure and the associated entropy differences of the two phases. The basic ideas are as follows.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Liquid vs. Solid Molar Volumes\n\nAssumption (a) tells us that the liquid has a larger molar volume than the solid (V_L > V_S). Therefore, when we apply pressure P, the phase with the smaller molar volume is favored energetically. In other words, raising the pressure will tend to convert liquid into solid since the solid “fits” better under high pressure.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Entropy in the Liquid and the Solid\n\nAssumption (b) gives the liquid’s molar entropy as\n  S_L = γR T    (with γ ≈ 4.6 K⁻¹),\nso that the liquid’s entropy increases linearly with temperature. For very low temperatures, S_L becomes very small.\n\nIn contrast, assumption (c) tells us that the solid’s entropy comes solely from the disorder of the nuclear spins (each with s = ½). In a complete spin-disordered state the solid’s entropy is essentially temperature–independent and of order\n  S_S ≈ Rln2.\nThus for T sufficiently low (say, T ≪ ln2/γ ≈ 0.15 K), we have \n  S_L ≪ S_S.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. The Melting (Liquid–Solid) Equilibrium and Clausius–Clapeyron\n\nThe equilibrium between the two phases obeys\n  dP/dT = ΔS/ΔV,\nwhere\n  ΔS = S_S – S_L,\nand \n  ΔV = V_S – V_L (< 0, since V_S < V_L).\n\nFor very low T, S_L is very small so that ΔS ≈ Rln2. Thus,\n  dP/dT ≈ (R ln2)/(V_S – V_L).\nSince V_S – V_L is negative (because V_S < V_L), the slope dP/dT is negative. In the p–T diagram this means that the melting curve (the coexistence line) drops with increasing temperature. Near T = 0, the liquid–solid coexistence exists at a relatively higher pressure; as T increases the pressure needed to maintain the two phases in equilibrium decreases.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. How Pressure Cooling Works\n\nNow imagine that we have an adiabatic container containing a mixture of liquid and solid He³ at very low temperature. If we slowly increase the pressure, the equilibrium requires more of the liquid (with its relatively low entropy, S_L ≈ γRT) to convert into the solid (with its nearly constant spin entropy S_S ≈ Rln2). Because the liquid (at low T) has a much smaller entropy per mole than the spin contribution in the solid, this conversion “absorbs” entropy from the remaining liquid. In an adiabatic (no heat exchange) process, the decrease in entropy of the liquid forces a reduction in its temperature. In effect, the latent heat for converting the liquid into the solid is provided by the internal energy of the system, thus cooling it.\n\nThus the key point is that the two phases have very different entropy behaviors. At low temperature the latent heat associated with freezing (liquid → solid) extracts energy from the system when pressure is applied adiabatically, thereby lowering the temperature. Hence, by carefully controlling the pressure such that the system remains in coexistence, one can achieve cooling in the He³ system.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. A Semi-Quantitative p–T Diagram\n\nBased on the above, one may sketch the low-temperature region of the p–T phase diagram for He³ as follows:\n\n • The coexistence (melting) line between liquid and solid has a negative slope given by\n  dP/dT ≈ (Rln2)/(V_S – V_L).\n • At T = 0 the required melting pressure is highest. As T increases from zero, one moves along a straight (or nearly linear) line downward in the p–T plane.\n • The diagram has two regions: at lower pressures the system is liquid and at higher pressures it is solid; the two regions meet along this negative-slope melting curve.\n\nA rough sketch:\n  \n         P\n       ↑\n       |   • (Solid region)\n       |   •\n       |  /\n       | /  Coexistence Line (dP/dT < 0)\n       |/ \n     ---•------------→ T\n       /    • (Liquid region)\n      /  •\n     /\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Summary\n\nBy applying pressure to a He³ liquid–solid mixture at low T, one induces the freezing of liquid into solid. Since the liquid’s entropy (γRT) is very small compared to the spin disorder (≈ Rln2) in the solid, converting liquid to solid extracts energy (i.e. latent heat) and thereby cools the system.

In what follows we will compute, step by step, the work done, the change in internal energy and the change in entropy during the melting process.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 1. Calculating Molar Volumes and ΔV\n\nFor one mole the mass is\n  m = 18.015 g.\n\nVolume of ice, V₍ice₎:\n  V₍ice₎ = m/ρ₍ice₎ = (18.015 g) / (0.917 g/cm³) ≈ 19.635 cm³.\n\nVolume of water, V₍water₎:\n  V₍water₎ = m/ρ₍water₎ = (18.015 g) / (0.9998 g/cm³) ≈ 18.016 cm³.\n\nThus the change in volume is\n  ΔV = V₍water₎ − V₍ice₎ ≈ 18.016 cm³ − 19.635 cm³ ≈ –1.619 cm³.\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the volume decreases when ice melts (recall, ice is “fluffier” than water).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 2. (a) Work Done\n\nIn a reversible process at constant pressure, the work done by the system is given by\n\n  W = –P ΔV       (with ΔV = V_final – V_initial).\n\nOur pressure, P, is 1 atm. In SI units we have\n  1 atm = 101325 Pa.\n\nAlso, we must convert the volume from cm³ to m³:\n  1 cm³ = 1×10⁻⁶ m³ ⇒ ΔV = –1.619 × 10⁻⁶ m³.\n\nThus,\n  W = –(101325 Pa)(–1.619 × 10⁻⁶ m³)\n    = +0.164 J (approximately).\n\nThis means that because the substance contracts upon melting, the “work done by the system” (as defined by the sign convention W = –∫P dV) comes out positive. (One may also say that 0.164 J of work is done on the system by its surroundings; the key point is that only a very small amount of work is associated with the volume change.)\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 3. (b) Change in Internal Energy\n\nRecall the enthalpy is defined by\n  ΔH = ΔU + PΔV     ⇒  ΔU = ΔH – PΔV.\n\nWe have ΔH given in kcal/mol. First, we convert it into joules:\n  1 kcal = 4184 J ⇒ ΔH = 1.4363 kcal/mol × 4184 J/kcal ≈ 6005 J/mol.\n\nWe already computed\n  PΔV = (101325 Pa)(–1.619×10⁻⁶ m³) = –0.164 J.\n\nThus,\n  ΔU = 6005 J – (–0.164 J) = 6005 J + 0.164 J ≈ 6005.16 J.\n\nSince the pΔV term is very small compared to ΔH, one sees that for melting ice at 0 °C, almost all of the enthalpy change appears as internal energy change.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 4. (c) Change in Entropy\n\nAt constant pressure (and, in fact, for a reversible process) the entropy change is given by\n  ΔS = Q_rev/T.\nAt constant pressure, the heat absorbed is equal to the enthalpy change, Q = ΔH. (We work on a molar basis.)\n\nThus,\n  ΔS = ΔH / T.\n\nWe already have ΔH ≈ 6005 J (for one mole) and T = 273.15 K (0 °C).

For a Bose–Einstein distribution the mean occupation number is\n  ⟨n⟩ = 1/(e^(βℏω) – 1)\nand it is well known that\n  Var(n) = ⟨n〉 (⟨n〉 + 1).\n\nSince the zero–point contribution ℏω/2 is a constant, we have\n  Var(E) = (ℏω)² Var(n) = (ℏω)² ⟨n〉 (1 + ⟨n〉).\n\nThus,\n  ⟨(ΔE)²⟩ = (ℏω)² [1/(e^(βℏω) – 1)] [1 + 1/(e^(βℏω) – 1)].\n\nIt is algebraically convenient to combine the factors.

Low–Temperature Limit (kT ≪ ℏω, so βℏω ≫ 1):\n\n (a) For the mean energy, note that e^(βℏω) is very large. Therefore,\n  ℏω/(e^(βℏω) – 1) ≈ ℏω e^(–βℏω),\n and hence\n  ⟨E⟩ ≈ ℏω/2 + ℏω e^(–βℏω).\nThus, at very low temperatures the oscillator is mostly in its ground state with energy ℏω/2, with only a small thermal excitation.\n\n (b) For the fluctuations, since the denominator is very large,\n  ΔE = ℏω e^(βℏω/2)/(e^(βℏω) – 1) ≈ ℏω e^(βℏω/2) e^(–βℏω) = ℏω e^(–βℏω/2).\nSo the energy fluctuation is exponentially suppressed at low temperatures.\n\n2. High–Temperature Limit (kT ≫ ℏω, so βℏω ≪ 1):\n\nIt is easiest to expand in βℏω as a small parameter.\n\n (a) For ⟨E⟩, note that\n  e^(βℏω) ≈ 1 + βℏω.\nThus,\n  ℏω/(e^(βℏω) – 1) ≈ ℏω/(βℏω) = 1/β = kT,\nso that\n  ⟨E⟩ ≈ ℏω/2 + kT.\nSince the zero–point term ℏω/2 is negligible compared to kT for high T, we recover the classical equipartition result:\n  ⟨E⟩ ≈ kT.\n\n (b) For the fluctuations,\n  ΔE = ℏω e^(βℏω/2)/(e^(βℏω) – 1).\nNow, using e^(βℏω/2) ≈ 1 + βℏω/2 and e^(βℏω) – 1 ≈ βℏω, we get\n  ΔE ≈ ℏω (1 + βℏω/2)/(βℏω) ≈ 1/β = kT.\nSo, at high temperatures the energy fluctuations are of the order of kT.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The mean energy is\n\n  ⟨E⟩ = ℏω/2 + ℏω/(e^(ℏω/(kT)) – 1).\n\n(b) The root–mean–square energy fluctuation is\n\n  ΔE = ℏω e^(ℏω/(2kT))/(e^(ℏω/(kT)) – 1).\n\n(c) In the limits:\n  • For kT ≪ ℏω:  ⟨E⟩ ≈ ℏω/2 + ℏω e^(–ℏω/(kT))  and  ΔE ≈ ℏω e^(–ℏω/(2kT)).\n  • For kT ≫ ℏω:  ⟨E⟩ ≈ kT  and  ΔE ≈ kT.\n\nThus, we see that at low temperatures the oscillator stays mostly in the ground state with exponentially small thermal corrections, while at high temperatures both the mean energy and its fluctuations increase linearly with temperature.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2} + \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{e^{\\hbar\\omega/(kT)}-1},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\Delta E = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega\\,e^{\\hbar\\omega/(2kT)}}{e^{\\hbar\\omega/(kT)}-1},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{For } kT\\ll\\hbar\\omega:\\; \\langle E \\rangle \\approx \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2},\\quad \\Delta E \\approx \\hbar\\omega\\,e^{-\\hbar\\omega/(2kT)};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{for } kT\\gg\\hbar\\omega:\\; \\langle E \\rangle \\approx kT,\\quad \\Delta E \\approx kT.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2} + \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{e^{\\hbar\\omega/(kT)}-1},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\Delta E = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega\\,e^{\\hbar\\omega/(2kT)}}{e^{\\hbar\\omega/(kT)}-1},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{For } kT\\ll\\hbar\\omega:\\; \\langle E \\rangle \\approx \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2},\\quad \\Delta E \\approx \\hbar\\omega\\,e^{-\\hbar\\omega/(2kT)};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{for } kT\\gg\\hbar\\omega:\\; \\langle E \\rangle \\approx kT,\\quad \\Delta E \\approx kT.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2} + \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{e^{\\hbar\\omega/(kT)}-1},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &\\Delta E = \\frac{\\hbar\\omega\\,e^{\\hbar\\omega/(2kT)}}{e^{\\hbar\\omega/(kT)}-1},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\text{For } kT\\ll\\hbar\\omega:\\; \\langle E \\rangle \\approx \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2},\\quad \\Delta E \\approx \\hbar\\omega\\,e^{-\\hbar\\omega/(2kT)};\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{for } kT\\gg\\hbar\\omega:\\; \\langle E \\rangle \\approx kT,\\quad \\Delta E \\approx kT.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2} \\coth \\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2 k T}\\right)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "statistics/1-23", "solution": "We wish to know how a “radiation‐trapping” envelope (a heat shield) affects the temperature that one “sees” externally. In our idealized model the object is a small (black) sphere of radius R at temperature T (so that if it were “bare” it would emit\n\n  P_bare = 4πR² σ T⁴)\n\nsurrounded by a concentric, very nearly touching, black shell (i.e. with nearly the same radius). (All bodies are assumed to be perfect blackbodies.) The outer surroundings are at 0 K.\n\nBelow we describe a step–by–step calculation for (a) with one shield and then (b) for the situation with more shields.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 1. One heat shield\n\nImagine placing a black “shield” (a thin, concentric spherical shell) immediately around the sphere. Since it is “black” it both absorbs and emits perfectly. (We assume its thickness is very small so that its interior and exterior surfaces have nearly the same area; namely, 4πR².) The shield is now between the hot sphere at temperature T and the cold (0 K) surroundings.\n\nNow, the sphere radiates on all sides:\n  P_sphere = 4πR² σ T⁴.\nAll of this power falls on the inner surface of the shield (because the shield completely encloses the sphere).\n\nHowever, the shield itself has two “radiating‐faces”: its inner and its outer surfaces. In steady state the shield’s energy content remains constant; therefore, the power it absorbs must equal the power it emits. (On the inner side it emits toward the sphere, and on the outer side it emits toward space.) Let the (uniform) temperature of the shield be T_sh. Then the total power the shield emits is\n\n  P_emitted = (radiation from inner side) + (radiation from outer side)\n        = 4πR² σ T_sh⁴ + 4πR² σ T_sh⁴ = 8πR² σ T_sh⁴.\nEnergy conservation for the shield implies\n\n  absorbed = emitted ⟹ 4πR² σ T⁴ = 8πR² σ T_sh⁴.\nCanceling the common factor 4πR² σ gives\n\n  T⁴ = 2 T_sh⁴  ⟹ T_sh⁴ = T⁴/2  ⟹ T_sh = T/2^(1/4).\n\nThus the shield comes into equilibrium at a temperature that is lower than T by a factor of 2^(1/4).\n\nNow, what is the net power going to the surroundings? Notice that nothing from the sphere can reach the environment directly because the shield intercepts all the radiation. The only way energy leaves to the surroundings is via the outer surface of the shield. That power is\n\n  P_out = 4πR² σ T_sh⁴ = 4πR² σ (T⁴/2) = (1/2)[4πR² σ T⁴] = P_bare/2.\n\nEven though the sphere is “firing” off 4πR²σT⁴ of power, only half of that gets out to space. (The other half is “returned” to the sphere via the inner surface of the shield.)\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 2. Additional heat shields\n\nNow suppose we add more shields. For each new shield, the situation is much like the single shield case. Label the sphere as “0” (with temperature T₀ = T) and let shield 1 have T₁, shield 2 have T₂, etc. Assume that every shield is very “close” (so that its inner and outer areas are essentially 4πR²). (The outer environment is still at 0 K.) Then:\n (1) The inner shield (shield 1) is powered by the sphere’s luminosity:\n  4πR² σ T₀⁴ = 2 (4πR² σ T₁⁴)\nso that T₁⁴ = T₀⁴/2 ⟹ T₁ = T/2^(1/4).\n\nNow, the next shield (shield 2) sees on its inner surface the radiation coming out of shield 1. However, notice that shield 1 emits from both its inner and outer surfaces; but only its outer emission leaves shield 1 and is incident on shield 2. Hence the power available for shield 2 is\n\n  P_in (to shield 2) = 4πR² σ T₁⁴.\nThen by the same “two–sides” energy–balance argument for shield 2 we have\n\n  4πR² σ T₁⁴ = 2 (4πR² σ T₂⁴)\nor  T₂⁴ = T₁⁴/2 = T₀⁴/2² ⟹ T₂ = T/2^(2/4) = T/2^(1/2).\n\nProceeding in the same way, if there are n shields surrounding the sphere then the outermost shield (labeled n) will have\n\n  T_n⁴ = T⁴/2ⁿ  or  T_n = T/2^(n/4).\n\nAnd its outer surface radiates\n\n  P_out = 4πR² σ T_n⁴ = 4πR² σ T⁴/2ⁿ,\ni.e. the power that eventually leaves to the cold surroundings is reduced by a factor of 1/2ⁿ compared with the bare sphere’s luminosity.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) With one nearby, black, heat‐shield the shield comes into equilibrium at\n\n  T_sh = T/2^(1/4),\nand the total outward power is\n\n  P_out = (1/2)(4πR² σ T⁴).\n\n(b) With n heat shields one finds\n\n  T_n = T/2^(n/4)  and  P_out = (4πR² σ T⁴)/2ⁿ.\n\nIn words, each additional shield “recycles” the radiative energy among two surfaces, thereby reducing the finally emitted power by another factor 1/2.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer in LaTeX boxed format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} &\\quad T_{\\text{shell}} = \\frac{T}{2^{1/4}}, \\quad P_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{4\\pi R^2\\sigma T^4}{2}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)} &\\quad \\text{With } n \\text{ shields, } T_n = \\frac{T}{2^{n/4}}, \\quad P_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{4\\pi R^2\\sigma T^4}{2^n}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} &\\quad T_{\\text{shell}} = \\frac{T}{2^{1/4}}, \\quad P_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{4\\pi R^2\\sigma T^4}{2}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)} &\\quad \\text{With } n \\text{ shields, } T_n = \\frac{T}{2^{n/4}}, \\quad P_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{4\\pi R^2\\sigma T^4}{2^n}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)} &\\quad T_{\\text{shell}} = \\frac{T}{2^{1/4}}, \\quad P_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{4\\pi R^2\\sigma T^4}{2}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)} &\\quad \\text{With } n \\text{ shields, } T_n = \\frac{T}{2^{n/4}}, \\quad P_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{4\\pi R^2\\sigma T^4}{2^n}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "T_1 = \\frac{T}{\\sqrt[4]{2}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "statistics/2-120", "solution": "We will tackle each part step by step:\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(a) Third Law of Thermodynamics\n\nThe third law of thermodynamics states that as a system’s temperature approaches absolute zero (0 K), the entropy of a perfect crystal also approaches zero. More precisely, for a perfectly ordered system (a perfect crystal) with a unique ground state, the limit is\n\n  lim (T → 0) S(T) = 0.\n\nAn important consequence is that it is impossible to reach absolute zero by any finite series of processes—the closer a system gets to 0 K, the more difficult it becomes to remove further entropy. This law provides a reference point for the measurement of entropy.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(b) Negative Absolute Temperature\n\nPhysical Meaning:\n- Temperature in statistical mechanics is defined by the relation 1/T = (∂S/∂E)_V,... meaning that the temperature is determined by how the entropy S changes with energy E. In most systems, adding energy increases the number of accessible states so that ∂S/∂E > 0 (i.e. T > 0).\n- In systems where the energy spectrum has an upper bound (a maximum allowed energy), if the system is excited sufficiently, further increases in energy can actually reduce the number of accessible microstates—this makes the derivative ∂S/∂E negative. Thus, by the thermodynamic definition, T becomes negative.\n- Negative absolute temperatures do not mean “colder than zero” in the everyday sense: in fact, these systems are “hotter” than any positive-temperature system. If you put a negative temperature system in thermal contact with any positive temperature system, heat will flow from the negative temperature system to the positive one.\n\nDoes It Violate the Third Law?\n- No. The third law concerns the behavior of the entropy and system properties as T → 0. The conditions giving rise to negative temperatures are associated with systems that have an inherent bound in energy and exist only in a limited, non-equilibrium sort of state. Since the third law is formulated for systems in which one can meaningfully consider approaching absolute zero with a vanishing entropy limit, the regime of negative temperatures lies outside that domain. It does not imply reaching T = 0 or a violation of the third law; rather, it indicates a peculiar situation where adding energy reduces entropy.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(c) Example of Achievable Negative Temperature\n\nA classic example is a system of nuclear spins in a magnetic field (such as in certain paramagnetic salts). In these systems:\n- The spins can only take on a limited number of orientations (e.g., “up” or “down”), so the energy spectrum is bounded.\n- Through magnetic field manipulation (for instance, rapid inversion of the external field), the population distribution can be inverted. When more spins occupy the higher-energy state than the lower one, the system evolves to a state with negative absolute temperature.\n- Other examples include ultracold atoms in optical lattices where the kinetic energy of the atoms is bounded by the lattice structure.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n(d) Negative Temperature in Classical Thermodynamics\n\n- In classical thermodynamics, systems are typically assumed to have unbounded energy spectra. For example, the kinetic energy of particles in an ideal gas can increase indefinitely.\n- The derivation of temperature from the entropy (based on a density of states that is monotonically increasing with energy) naturally leads to the conclusion that T is always positive.\n- As a result, the concept of negative temperature arises only for systems with an upper bound on energy—something that is not physically relevant or realizable in classical systems.\n- Additionally, the mathematical treatment of classical partition functions would break down (diverge) if one attempted to incorporate negative temperatures, since the required normalization of probability distributions would fail.

Free Energy\n\nFor one molecule the overall Hamiltonian separates so that the single–molecule partition function factors into a translational and an internal part. (In what follows we call the volume appearing in the translational part V₁.) The translational part in three dimensions is\n\n  z_trans = (1/h³) ∫ d³p exp[–β p²/(2m)] × V₁\n       = V₁/h³ · (2π m kT)^(3/2) ,       [since ∫₋∞^∞ exp(–a p²)dp = √(π/a) ]\n\nand the internal partition function is\n\n  z_int = Σₖ exp(–βεₖ).\n\nThus the single–molecule partition function is\n  z = (V₁/(h³)) (2π m kT)^(3/2) z_int.\n\nSince the gas has N molecules which are indistinguishable, the total canonical partition function is\n  Z = z^N/N! = (1/N!) [ V₁/(h³)(2π m kT)^(3/2) z_int ]^N.\n\nThen the Helmholtz free energy is defined by\n  F = –kT ln Z.\n\nTaking the logarithm we get\n  ln Z = N ln z – ln N! , and using Stirling’s formula ln N! ≈ N ln N – N, one may write\n\n  F = –NkT ln z + NkT ln N – NkT.\n\nIt is customary to “absorb” the NkT ln N – NkT into the logarithm by writing\n  F = –NkT { ln [ (V₁/N)(2π m kT/h²)^(3/2) z_int ] + 1 }.\n\nOne must note that the volume dependence appears explicitly as V₁ (remember that here V₁ is the volume of the vessel).

The Total Entropy of Two Gases\n\nNow suppose we have a second vessel containing the same number N of molecules of the same gas at temperature T but (initially) at pressure P₂. (For an ideal gas we always have PV = NkT so that the volume in each case is given by V_i = NkT/P_i, i = 1, 2.) \n\nThe Sackur–Tetrode formula (including the contribution of the internal states) tells us that the entropy of a gas whose free energy is given by\n  F = –NkT { ln[ (V/N)(2π m kT/h²)^(3/2) z_int ] + 1 }\nhas entropy\n\n  S = –(∂F/∂T)_V\nwhich, after a short calculation, may be written as\n\n  S = Nk { ln[ (V/N)(2π m kT/h²)^(3/2) z_int ] + 5/2 + T (d ln z_int/dT) }.\n\nSince V₁ = NkT/P₁ and V₂ = NkT/P₂, the entropies of the two vessels may be written as\n\n  S₁ = Nk { ln[ (kT/P₁)(2π m kT/h²)^(3/2) z_int ] + 5/2 + T (d ln z_int/dT) },\n  S₂ = Nk { ln[ (kT/P₂)(2π m kT/h²)^(3/2) z_int ] + 5/2 + T (d ln z_int/dT) }.\n\nThus the total entropy before mixing is\n\n  S_total_initial = S₁ + S₂.\n\nYou may leave your answer in this form. (Any answer equivalent to the above is correct.)\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (c). Entropy Change on Mixing\n\nNow we “connect” the two vessels so that the two gases mix at fixed temperature T and without doing work. (In this process the molecules of the gas initially in vessel 1 are allowed to explore both volumes, and likewise for those initially in vessel 2.) Since the gases are identical the overall “mixing” entropy is a little subtle. However, if we think of the process as each gas “freely expanding” into the extra volume (notice that initially the gas in vessel 1 is confined to V₁ and then has available the total volume V₁ + V₂, and similarly for vessel 2) then the irreversible entropy gain is given by the sum of the increases for each gas.\n\nFor a free expansion from volume V to volume V' the entropy change is\n\n  ΔS = Nk ln(V'/V).\n\nThus for the gas initially in vessel 1\n  ΔS₁ = Nk ln[(V₁ + V₂)/V₁],\nand for the gas initially in vessel 2\n  ΔS₂ = Nk ln[(V₁ + V₂)/V₂].\n\nThus the total entropy change is\n\n  ΔS = ΔS₁ + ΔS₂ = Nk [ ln((V₁ + V₂)/V₁) + ln((V₁ + V₂)/V₂) ]\n      = Nk ln[ (V₁ + V₂)²/(V₁ V₂) ].\n\nIt is often preferable to express this in terms of the pressures. Since for an ideal gas\n\n  V_i = NkT/P_i   (i = 1, 2),\nwe have\n\n  V₁ + V₂ = NkT (1/P₁ + 1/P₂) = NkT (P₁ + P₂)/(P₁P₂),\n  V₁V₂ = (NkT)²/(P₁P₂).\n\nTherefore,\n  (V₁ + V₂)²/(V₁V₂) = [ (NkT)² (P₁ + P₂)²/(P₁P₂)² ] / [ (NkT)²/(P₁P₂) ] = (P₁ + P₂)²/(P₁P₂).\n\nThus the total entropy change is\n\n  ΔS = Nk ln[ (P₁ + P₂)²/(P₁P₂) ].\n\nA quick check shows that if the two vessels have equal volumes (which from PV = NkT is equivalent to taking P₁ = P₂ = P) then\n  ΔS = Nk ln[ (2P)²/(P²) ] = Nk ln 4 = 2Nk ln 2,\nso that each gas gains an entropy Nk ln2 (which is what one obtains by free expansion from volume V to 2V).\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The free energy of the gas in a vessel of volume V₁ is\n\n  F = –NkT { ln[ (V₁/N)(2π m kT/h²)^(3/2) z_int ] + 1 }.\n\n(b) The entropies of the two gases are given by\n\n  S₁ = Nk { ln[ (kT/P₁)(2π m kT/h²)^(3/2) z_int ] + 5/2 + T (d ln z_int/dT) },\n  S₂ = Nk { ln[ (kT/P₂)(2π m kT/h²)^(3/2) z_int ] + 5/2 + T (d ln z_int/dT) },\nand so the total entropy is S_total = S₁ + S₂.\n\n(c) After connection (mixing), each gas expands from its original volume V_i to the total volume V₁ + V₂ and the total change in entropy is\n\n  ΔS = Nk ln[(V₁ + V₂)²/(V₁V₂)] = Nk ln[ (P₁ + P₂)²/(P₁P₂) ].\n\nIn particular, if V₁ = V₂ (i.e. P₁ = P₂) then ΔS = 2Nk ln2, which is as expected.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Latex Boxed Form\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & F = -NkT \\left\\{ \\ln \\left[ \\frac{V_1}{N}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi m kT}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\, z_{\\text{int}} \\right] + 1 \\right\\},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & S_1 = Nk \\left\\{ \\ln\\left[ \\frac{kT}{P_1}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi m kT}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\, z_{\\text{int}} \\right] + \\frac{5}{2} + T \\frac{d\\ln z_{\\text{int}}}{dT} \\right\\},\\\\[1mm]\n& S_2 = Nk \\left\\{ \\ln\\left[ \\frac{kT}{P_2}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi m kT}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\, z_{\\text{int}} \\right] + \\frac{5}{2} + T \\frac{d\\ln z_{\\text{int}}}{dT} \\right\\},\\\\[1mm]\n& \\text{so that } S_\\text{total} = S_1+S_2,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\Delta S = Nk \\ln \\frac{(V_1+V_2)^2}{V_1 V_2}\n= Nk \\ln \\frac{(P_1+P_2)^2}{P_1 P_2}\\,. \n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & F = -NkT \\left\\{ \\ln \\left[ \\frac{V_1}{N}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi m kT}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\, z_{\\text{int}} \\right] + 1 \\right\\"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & F = -NkT \\left\\{ \\ln \\left[ \\frac{V_1}{N}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi m kT}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\, z_{\\text{int}} \\right] + 1 \\right\\", "expr2": "F = -kT \\left(N \\ln V_1 + N \\ln z_0 + \\frac{3N}{2} \\ln \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi mkT}{h^2}\\right) - \\ln N!\\right)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "statistics/2-67", "solution": "We start by recalling that in an ideal (non-interacting, non-relativistic) Bose gas one obtains the total number of particles above the ground state when the fugacity z = 1 (its maximum allowed value) by integrating over the density of states multiplied by the Bose distribution. The idea is that at the critical temperature the excited states “hold” the maximum number of particles. When that maximum number is less than the total number of particles present, the excess must accumulate in the ground state. This is the hallmark of Bose–Einstein condensation (BEC).\n\nStep 1. The density of states\nFor a d-dimensional gas, the density of states (DOS) g(ε) behaves roughly as\n  g(ε) ∝ ε^(d/2 – 1).\nThus:\n • In 3D: g(ε) ∝ ε^(1/2)\n • In 2D: g(ε) ∝ ε^(0) (a constant)\n • In 1D: g(ε) ∝ ε^(–1/2)\n\nStep 2. Integrating the occupation of excited states\nThe number of particles in the excited states is obtained (in the thermodynamic limit) from an integral like\n  N_exc = ∫₀∞ dε g(ε) / (e^(βε) – 1).\nFor condensation to occur, this number must remain finite at the point where the chemical potential μ → 0 (i.e. z → 1).\n\nStep 3. Analysis for various dimensions\n\n• In 3D, with g(ε) ∝ ε^(1/2), the integral converges at the lower limit (ε = 0). Therefore, there is a finite maximum number of particles that can be accommodated in the excited states at any T > 0. So, if the total number N is greater than this maximum, the excess particles must condense into the ground state, and BEC occurs at a finite critical temperature.\n\n• In 2D, with a constant DOS (g(ε) ∝ const), the integral ∫₀∞ dε/(e^(βε) – 1) diverges (logarithmically) at the lower limit when μ → 0. This means that the excited states can always absorb all the particles for any T > 0, and a macroscopic occupation of the ground state (a true BEC) is absent in the thermodynamic limit.\n\n• In 1D, where g(ε) ∝ ε^(–1/2), the situation is even more dramatic since the integral diverges more strongly at low energies. Thus, no finite temperature can “force” condensation into the ground state in the thermodynamic limit.\n\nStep 4. Caveats regarding finite systems and traps\nIt is important to note that although in an infinite homogeneous system one does not find BEC in one and two dimensions, experiments often involve confining potentials (such as harmonic traps) and finite system sizes. In such cases, the density of states is modified by the trap and the system can show condensation-like behavior even in lower effective dimensions. However, the “true” phase transition that one finds in 3D never occurs in 2D or 1D in the strict thermodynamic limit.\n\nFinal Answer:\nFor a homogeneous ideal Bose gas, Bose–Einstein condensation at finite temperature occurs only in three dimensions. In a two-dimensional and one-dimensional homogeneous gas, the integral over the excited states diverges near zero energy, so no finite-temperature condensation occurs in the thermodynamic limit.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{BEC occurs in 3D since the excited state population integral converges, but in 2D and 1D it diverges, preventing a finite-temperature phase transition.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{BEC occurs in 3D since the excited state population integral converges, but in 2D and 1D it diverges, preventing a finite-temperature phase transition.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{BEC occurs in 3D since the excited state population integral converges, but in 2D and 1D it diverges, preventing a finite-temperature phase transition.}", "expr2": "\\text{Bose-Einstein condensation does not occur.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{BEC occurs in 3D since the excited state population integral converges, but in 2D and 1D it diverges, preventing a finite-temperature phase transition.}", "expr2": "\\text{Bose-Einstein condensation does not occur.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "statistics/1-82", "solution": "We begin by recalling that the elasticity of a rubber band is largely entropic in nature. Its molecules (or polymer chains) have many available configurations when unstretched. Stretching the rubber band forces these chains into a more aligned, ordered state, thereby reducing the number of available configurations.\n\nStep 1. (a) Isothermal Stretching\n\n– In an isothermal process the temperature is maintained constant by exchanging heat with a reservoir.\n– As the rubber band is stretched, its polymer chains are forced into a more ordered arrangement. This reduction in the number of accessible microscopic states means that the configurational (entropy) content of the rubber band decreases.\n– Even though the process is reversible (if done slowly) and the total free energy change is governed by both energy and entropy, the intrinsic entropy of the rubber (its configurational degree of freedom) decreases upon stretching.\n\nThus, (a) when a rubber band is stretched isothermally, its entropy decreases.\n\nStep 2. (b) Adiabatic Stretching\n\n– In an adiabatic process, there is no heat exchange with the surroundings (dQ = 0). Therefore, any work done on the rubber band goes entirely into changing its internal energy.\n– For a rubber band, much of the internal energy is thermal. When the band is stretched adiabatically, work is done on it and, because no heat is removed to keep the temperature constant, the temperature must rise.\n– The increase in temperature indicates an increase in the internal energy of the rubber band; the energy has been stored as thermal energy (and slight energetic contributions from stretching the bonds) rather than being lost as heat.\n\nThus, (b) when a rubber band is stretched adiabatically, its internal energy increases.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{(a) Entropy decreases, and (b) Internal energy increases.}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{(a) Entropy decreases, and (b) Internal energy increases.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{(a) Entropy decreases, and (b) Internal energy increases.}", "expr2": "\\text{Entropy stays the same isothermally}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{(a) Entropy decreases, and (b) Internal energy increases.}", "expr2": "\\text{Internal energy increases adiabatically}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

The Physical Reason Behind the Difference\n\nThe difference arises because when a gas is heated at constant pressure, not only is energy required to raise its temperature (which increases its internal energy), but an extra amount of energy is also needed to perform work against the external pressure as the gas expands. At constant volume, no work is done since there is no expansion. Therefore, the extra energy needed at constant pressure is exactly the product of the pressure and the volume change, which, for an ideal gas, turns out to be R per unit temperature increase.\n\nStep 4. Final Answer\n\nThus, for an ideal gas the difference between the specific heats is given by\n\n  cₚ – cᵥ = R.\n\nThis explains why the difference is nearly equal for all simple gases—it reflects the universal requirement to supply the work done by expansion in a constant-pressure process for an ideal gas.\n\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Box:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{c_p - c_v = R}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["c_p - c_v = R"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "c_p - c_v = R", "expr2": "R/M"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "R", "expr2": "R/M"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "c_p - c_v = R", "expr2": "c_p - c_v = R/M"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "R", "expr2": "R/M"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "statistics/1-119", "solution": "Let’s examine each statement step by step.\n\n(a) “The liquid phase can exist at absolute zero.”\n\nNormally, as T → 0 most substances “freeze” into a solid because the crystal is the lowest‐energy state. However, helium (especially 4He) is a famous exception. At atmospheric pressure 4He remains liquid down to T = 0 (it never solidifies owing to its large zero–point energy). Therefore, there exists at least one substance that can have a liquid phase at absolute zero. \n\nAnswer for (a): T.\n\n–––––––––––––––\n\n(b) “The solid phase can exist at temperatures above the critical temperature.”\n\nThe “critical temperature” is defined for the liquid–vapor phase transition; above it, no distinct liquid phase exists. However, this does not preclude the existence of a solid phase. Under sufficiently high pressure, many substances can be solid even at temperatures above the critical temperature of the liquid–vapor system. \n\nAnswer for (b): T.\n\n–––––––––––––––\n\n(c) “Oxygen boils at a higher temperature than nitrogen.”\n\nAt atmospheric pressure, nitrogen boils at about 77 K and oxygen at about 90 K. Hence oxygen indeed boils at a higher temperature. \n\nAnswer for (c): T.\n\n–––––––––––––––\n\n(d) “The maximum inversion temperature of He is less than 20 K.”\n\nThe inversion temperature is the temperature above which a gas heats (instead of cooling) upon expansion in a Joule–Thomson process. For helium, the inversion (or “maximum inversion”) temperature is known to be quite low compared to many gases, but it is actually around 40 K (roughly in the range 38–40 K), not below 20 K.\n\nAnswer for (d): F.\n\n–––––––––––––––\n\n(e) “γ of a gas is always greater than one.”\n\nFor any gas, γ ≡ Cₚ/Cᵥ and since Cₚ – Cᵥ = R is positive, we have γ = 1 + R/Cᵥ > 1. (Even when many degrees of freedom are activated, Cᵥ remains positive and finite.) \n\nAnswer for (e): T.\n\n–––––––––––––––\n\n(f) “A compressor will get hotter when compressing a diatomic gas than when compressing a monatomic gas at the same rate.”\n\nDuring an adiabatic compression, the final temperature depends on the exponent γ – 1 (since T_final = T_initial·r^(γ–1) for a compression ratio r). Monatomic gases have γ ≈ 1.67 (so γ – 1 ≈ 0.67), while diatomic gases typically have γ ≈ 1.4 (so γ – 1 ≈ 0.4). Thus, for the same compression, a monatomic gas would experience a larger temperature increase than a diatomic gas.  \n\nAnswer for (f): F.\n\n–––––––––––––––\n\n(g) “The coefficient of performance of a refrigerator can be greater than one.”\n\nThe coefficient of performance (COP) of a refrigerator is defined as COP = Q_cold/W, where Q_cold is the heat removed from the cold reservoir. It is common (and desirable) for COP to be greater than one – meaning more heat is removed than the work input. \n\nAnswer for (g): T.\n\n–––––––––––––––\n\n(h) “A slightly roughened ball is thrown from north to south. As one looks down from above, the ball is seen to be spinning counterclockwise. The ball is seen to curve toward east.”\n\nA ball spinning counterclockwise (as seen from above) has an angular momentum vector pointing upward. When it moves southward, the Magnus force (given approximately by F ∝ ω × v) is directed to the east (since ω is upward and v is south). Thus, the ball curves eastward.\n\nAnswer for (h): T.\n\n–––––––––––––––\n\nFinal answer:\n\na: T  \nb: T  \nc: T  \nd: F  \ne: T  \nf: F  \ng: T  \nh: T\n\nIn summary, \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{a\\ T,\\quad b\\ T,\\quad c\\ T,\\quad d\\ F,\\quad e\\ T,\\quad f\\ F,\\quad g\\ T,\\quad h\\ T}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["a\\ T,\\quad b\\ T,\\quad c\\ T,\\quad d\\ F,\\quad e\\ T,\\quad f\\ F,\\quad g\\ T,\\quad h\\ T"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "a\\ T,\\quad b\\ T,\\quad c\\ T,\\quad d\\ F,\\quad e\\ T,\\quad f\\ F,\\quad g\\ T,\\quad h\\ T", "expr2": "(a) \\, F"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": "I don't understand this\na\\ T,\\quad b\\ T,\\quad c\\ T,\\quad d\\ F,\\quad e\\ T,\\quad f\\ F,\\quad g\\ T,\\quad h\\ T\n~^"}], "accuracy": 1.0}

(Process A → B: Constant–pressure expansion)\n\nWe assume that the gas expands at constant pressure until its temperature doubles from 300 K to 600 K.

Thus,\n  ΔU₍A→B₎ = 0.081 kmol × (3/2 × 8.314 kJ/(kmol·K)) × (600 – 300 K).\nFirst compute Cᵥ:\n  Cᵥ = (3/2)×8.314 ≈ 12.471 kJ/(kmol·K).\nThen,\n  ΔU₍A→B₎ ≈ 0.081 × 12.471 × 300 ≈ 0.081 × 3741.3 ≈ 303 kJ.\n\n(c) The first law for this process tells us that\n  ΔU = Q – W             (using sign conventions where work done by the gas is positive)\nSo the heat added is\n  Q₍A→B₎ = ΔU + W.\nAlternatively, one may note that for a constant-pressure process\n  Q = n Cₚ ΔT,\nwith Cₚ = 5R/2 for helium.

(We assume the adiabatic process is reversible so that Q = 0 and the entropy change is zero.) Moreover, we assume that the adiabatic expansion is taken far enough that the gas cools down back to the original temperature (a common textbook example). Hence assume\n\n  T₍C₎ = 300 K.\n  \nFor a reversible adiabatic (i.e. isentropic) process of an ideal gas one has\n  T V^(γ–1) = constant         or   pV^γ = constant.\nFor a monatomic gas, the adiabatic exponent is\n  γ = Cₚ/Cᵥ = (5R/2)/(3R/2) = 5/3.\n  \nUsing the ideal–gas law also we can determine the final pressure. In state C we have\n  p₍C₎ = (n R T₍C₎)/V₍C₎.\nBut we can also deduce V₍C₎ from the isentropic relation applied between B and C:\n  T₍B₎ V₍B₎^(γ–1) = T₍C₎ V₍C₎^(γ–1)\n⟹ V₍C₎^(γ–1) = (T₍B₎/T₍C₎) V₍B₎^(γ–1)\n⟹ V₍C₎ = V₍B₎ (T₍B₎/T₍C₎)^(1/(γ–1)).\n  \nHere, T₍B₎/T₍C₎ = 600/300 = 2 and since γ – 1 = 5/3 – 1 = 2/3, we have \n  1/(γ–1) = 3/2.\nThus,\n  V₍C₎ = 2.02 m³ × 2^(3/2) ≈ 2.02 m³ × 2.828 ≈ 5.72 m³.\n  \nThen the final pressure is\n  p₍C₎ = (n R T₍C₎)/V₍C₎ = [0.081 × 8.314 × 300] / 5.72.\nBut note that the numerator 0.081×8.314×300 is the same as that we computed for state A (≈201.9 kJ), so\n  p₍C₎ ≈ 201.9/5.72 ≈ 35.3 kPa  (or 3.53×10⁴ Pa).\n  \nAlso, because the adiabatic process is reversible (Q = 0) the total entropy change for B → C is zero:\n  ΔS₍B→C₎ = 0.\n  \nAn equivalent way of writing the final pressure is to use\n  p₍C₎ = p₍B₎ (T₍C₎/T₍B₎)^(γ/(γ–1)).\nSince (T₍C₎/T₍B₎) = 300/600 = 0.5 and\n  γ/(γ–1)= (5/3)/(2/3)= 5/2,\nwe have\n  p₍C₎ = 200 kPa × (0.5)^(5/2) ≈ 200 kPa × 0.177 ≈ 35.4 kPa.\n  \n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The work done in the constant–pressure expansion is \n  W₍A→B₎ ≈ 202 kJ.\n\n(b) The change in internal energy during A → B is \n  ΔU₍A→B₎ ≈ 303 kJ.\n\n(c) The heat absorbed during A → B is \n  Q₍A→B₎ ≈ 504 kJ.\n\n(d) For the adiabatic B → C process the entropy change is zero\n  (ΔS₍B→C₎ = 0)\nand the final pressure is \n  p₍C₎ ≈ 3.54×10⁴ N/m².\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThus, one acceptable final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\nW_{A\\to B} &\\approx 2.02\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\quad\n\\Delta U_{A\\to B}\\approx 3.03\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\quad\nQ_{A\\to B}\\approx 5.04\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\\\[1mm]\n\\Delta S_{B\\to C} &= 0,\\quad\np_C\\approx 3.54\\times10^4~\\text{N/m}^2.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nAny answer equivalent to the one above is correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\nW_{A\\to B} &\\approx 2.02\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\quad\n\\Delta U_{A\\to B}\\approx 3.03\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\quad\nQ_{A\\to B}\\approx 5.04\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\\\[1mm]\n\\Delta S_{B\\to C} &= 0,\\quad\np_C\\approx 3.54\\times10^4~\\text{N/m}^2.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\nW_{A\\to B} &\\approx 2.02\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\quad\n\\Delta U_{A\\to B}\\approx 3.03\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\quad\nQ_{A\\to B}\\approx 5.04\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\\\[1mm]\n\\Delta S_{B\\to C} &= 0,\\quad\np_C\\approx 3.54\\times10^4~\\text{N/m}^2.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "W = 1.0 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{J}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\nW_{A\\to B} &\\approx 2.02\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\quad\n\\Delta U_{A\\to B}\\approx 3.03\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\quad\nQ_{A\\to B}\\approx 5.04\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\\\[1mm]\n\\Delta S_{B\\to C} &= 0,\\quad\np_C\\approx 3.54\\times10^4~\\text{N/m}^2.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\Delta U = 1.5 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{J}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\nW_{A\\to B} &\\approx 2.02\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\quad\n\\Delta U_{A\\to B}\\approx 3.03\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\quad\nQ_{A\\to B}\\approx 5.04\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\\\[1mm]\n\\Delta S_{B\\to C} &= 0,\\quad\np_C\\approx 3.54\\times10^4~\\text{N/m}^2.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "Q = 2.5 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{J}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\nW_{A\\to B} &\\approx 2.02\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\quad\n\\Delta U_{A\\to B}\\approx 3.03\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\quad\nQ_{A\\to B}\\approx 5.04\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\\\[1mm]\n\\Delta S_{B\\to C} &= 0,\\quad\np_C\\approx 3.54\\times10^4~\\text{N/m}^2.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "p_C = 1.24 \\times 10^5 \\, \\text{N/m}^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\nW_{A\\to B} &\\approx 2.02\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\quad\n\\Delta U_{A\\to B}\\approx 3.03\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\quad\nQ_{A\\to B}\\approx 5.04\\times10^5~\\text{J},\\\\[1mm]\n\\Delta S_{B\\to C} &= 0,\\quad\np_C\\approx 3.54\\times10^4~\\text{N/m}^2.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\Delta S = 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

The initial volumes are\n\n  Vₐᵢ = 10 L    and  V_bᵢ = 1 L,\nwhile the piston is moved reversibly so that the final volumes become\n\n  Vₐ_f = 6 L    and  V_b_f = 5 L.\n\nBecause the cylinder’s walls allow heat transfer, each compartment is maintained at the bath temperature T. (The piston is adiabatic, so there is no heat exchange between the compartments, but each compartment exchanges heat with the bath so that the process is isothermal.)\n\nFor an ideal gas undergoing a reversible isothermal process, the work done by the gas is given by\n\n  W = nRT ln(V_f/V_i).\n\nIt is important to note that here we have two “sub‐systems” working in opposite directions (one is expanded, one is compressed) so that the work done on/by the piston is the sum of the contributions of compartments a and b.\n\nFor compartment a:\n  n = 1 mole,  T = 273.15 K,\n  Wₐ = 1 · R·T · ln(Vₐ_f/Vₐᵢ)\n     = R T ln(6/10).\n\nSince 6 < 10, ln(6/10) is negative; this means that the gas in compartment a is compressed (i.e. work is done on it).\n\nFor compartment b:\n  W_b = 1 · R·T · ln(V_b_f/V_bᵢ)\n     = R T ln(5/1).\n\nBecause 5 > 1, ln(5) is positive; here the gas expands and does work on the piston.\n\nThus the net work performed by the overall system (taking both compartments together) is\n\n  W_net = Wₐ + W_b\n     = R T [ln(6/10) + ln(5/1)]\n     = R T ln[(6/10)·5]\n     = R T ln(3).\n\nSince R ≃ 8.314 J/(mol·K) and T = 273.15 K, we have numerical value\n\n  W_net ≃ 8.314 × 273.15 × ln(3).\n\nNow, ln(3) ≃ 1.0986, so\n\n  W_net ≃ 8.314 × 273.15 × 1.0986   (in Joules).\n\nLet us compute it:\n  8.314 × 273.15 ≈ 2271 J,\n  2271 J × 1.0986 ≈ 2494 J.\n\nThus, the net work delivered by the system is approximately 2.5×10^3 J. (By “delivered by the system” we mean that the system as a whole does about 2.5 kJ of work on the piston; note that one part is doing work on the other, but the net effect is as given.)\n\n─────────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) An acceptable answer for the Helmholtz free energy is\n\n  F(T,V,N) = –NRT ln [ (V/N)(mkT/(2πħ^2))^(3/2) ] – NRT.\n\n(b) The net work delivered by the system is\n\n  W = R T ln(3)    (≈ 2.5×10^3 J at 273.15 K).\n\n─────────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer in LaTeX Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & F(T,V,N) = -NRT \\ln\\!\\left[\\frac{V}{N}\\left(\\frac{m kT}{2\\pi \\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}\\right] - NRT, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & W = R T \\ln(3)\\quad\\text{or}\\quad W \\approx 2.5\\times10^3\\text{ J \\, (at } T=273.15\\text{ K)}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & F(T,V,N) = -NRT \\ln\\!\\left[\\frac{V}{N}\\left(\\frac{m kT}{2\\pi \\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}\\right] - NRT, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & W = R T \\ln(3)\\quad\\text{or}\\quad W \\approx 2.5\\times10^3\\text{ J \\, (at } T=273.15\\text{ K)}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & F(T,V,N) = -NRT \\ln\\!\\left[\\frac{V}{N}\\left(\\frac{m kT}{2\\pi \\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}\\right] - NRT, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & W = R T \\ln(3)\\quad\\text{or}\\quad W \\approx 2.5\\times10^3\\text{ J \\, (at } T=273.15\\text{ K)}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "F = \\frac{3NRT}{2} - \\frac{3NRT}{2} \\ln \\frac{T}{T_0} + NRT \\ln \\frac{V}{V_0} + F_0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & F(T,V,N) = -NRT \\ln\\!\\left[\\frac{V}{N}\\left(\\frac{m kT}{2\\pi \\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}\\right] - NRT, \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & W = R T \\ln(3)\\quad\\text{or}\\quad W \\approx 2.5\\times10^3\\text{ J \\, (at } T=273.15\\text{ K)}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "W = 2.6 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{J}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "statistics/1-25", "solution": "We wish to find the net radiative energy per unit area per second (that is, the net flux) transferred between two large, nearly‐parallel plates in vacuum. In what follows we will assume that each plate is “grey” – that is, it emits (and absorbs) a fraction of that of a black body at the same temperature. (By Kirchhoff’s law the emissivity e in emission equals the absorptivity in absorption.) We denote by\n\n  E₁ = σT₁⁴ and E₂ = σT₂⁴\n\nthe black‐body emission (in W/m²) at temperatures T₁ and T₂, and by e₁ and e₂ the emissivities of the two plates. (Note that 0 < eᵢ ≤ 1; for a black body eᵢ = 1.) Our aim is to show that the net energy exchange is\n\n  W = (E₁ – E₂)⁄ (E₁/e₁ + E₂/e₂ – 1).                 (1)\n\nIn many texts one finds an answer written in the equivalent form\n\n  W = (E₁ – E₂)⁄ (1/e₁ + 1/e₂ – 1).              (1′)\n\nThese forms are equivalent since E₁ and E₂ are the black‐body emissive powers at the given temperatures.\n\nLet us explain step‐by‐step how one may arrive at this result.\n\n─────────────────────────\nStep (a): Derivation for Two Plates\n─────────────────────────\n\nImagine first that plate 1, at temperature T₁, would radiate as a black body (with flux E₁) but because its surface is only “grey” with emissivity e₁ it actually emits only\n\n  J₁ = e₁E₁  (going towards plate 2).\n\nSimilarly, plate 2 emits a flux\n\n  J₂ = e₂E₂  (going toward plate 1).\n\nBecause the plates are opaque the radiation impinging on one is partly absorbed (with probability equal to its e value) and partly reflected (with reflectivity 1 – e). (We assume that there is no transmission.) Thus a fraction e₂ of the radiation from plate 1 is absorbed by plate 2, and a fraction 1 – e₂ is reflected back. However, the reflected radiation may again reflect from plate 1 (with its “reflection factor” 1 – e₁) and so on. In other words, there is an infinite series of reflections which, when summed up, gives an effective “radiative resistance” to energy transfer.\n\nOne way to organize the calculation is as follows. The first “direct” transfer is\n\n  F₁₂^(0) = e₂ J₁ = e₁e₂E₁,\n  F₂₁^(0) = e₁ J₂ = e₁e₂E₂.\n\nBut then the radiation from plate 1 that is not absorbed by plate 2 is reflected (with a factor 1–e₂) and then partly absorbed by plate 1 etc. Taking all such multiple reflections into account, one finds that the net energy transmitted from plate 1 to plate 2 is\n\n  F₁₂ = e₁e₂E₁ [1 + (1 – e₁)(1 – e₂) + ((1 – e₁)(1 – e₂))² + ⋯]\n     = e₁e₂E₁⁄[1 – (1 – e₁)(1 – e₂)].\n\nA similar expression holds for the energy transmitted from plate 2 to plate 1. Thus the net flux from plate 1 to plate 2 is\n\n  W = F₁₂ – F₂₁\n     = e₁e₂(E₁ – E₂)⁄[1 – (1 – e₁)(1 – e₂)].\n\nNow note that\n\n  1 – (1 – e₁)(1 – e₂) = e₁ + e₂ – e₁e₂.\n\nThus, we can write\n\n  W = [e₁e₂(E₁ – E₂)]⁄(e₁ + e₂ – e₁e₂).\n\nA little bit of algebra now is illuminating. Divide numerator and denominator by e₁e₂:\n  W = (E₁ – E₂)⁄[(1/e₂) + (1/e₁) – 1].\n\nThat is, we may write\n\n  W = (E₁ – E₂)⁄(1/e₁ + 1/e₂ – 1).       (A)\n\nThis is equivalent to writing W in the form given in (1) (since E₁ and E₂ are known numbers).\n\n─────────────────────────\nStep (b): The Case of Two Black Bodies (T₁ = 300 K, T₂ = 4.2 K)\n─────────────────────────\n\nFor black bodies e₁ = e₂ = 1. In that case (A) immediately gives\n\n  W = (E₁ – E₂)⁄(1 + 1 – 1) = E₁ – E₂ = σ(T₁⁴ – T₂⁴).\n\nSubstitute the numbers:\n  T₁ = 300 K and T₂ = 4.2 K,\n  300⁴ = 300×300×300×300 ≈ 8.1×10⁹ (W/m² units when multiplied by σ),\n  4.2⁴ is very small (≈ 311) in comparison.\nThus,\n  W ≈ σ (8.1×10⁹).\nTaking σ = 5.67×10⁻⁸ W/m²K⁴ we obtain:\n\n  W ≈ 5.67×10⁻⁸ × 8.1×10⁹ ≈ 460 W/m².\n\n─────────────────────────\nStep (c): n Intermediate Black‐Body Plates\n─────────────────────────\n\nNow suppose that in the vacuum gap between the two original plates we insert n identical black‐body plates. In steady state the intermediate plates will come to temperatures such that the radiative flux is the same through each gap (that is, there is no net energy buildup in any of the intermediate plates). For black‐body surfaces the “resistance” to radiative transfer is simply one (that is, from (A) if e = 1 the resistance term becomes 1/e, and the denominator for one gap is 1+1–1 = 1). When there are n + 1 “gaps” in series the net “resistance” is multiplied by n + 1. (This is completely analogous to having thermal resistances in series.)

{"id": "statistics/1-6", "solution": "We begin by recalling that the (constant‐volume) heat capacity C_v is defined as\n\n  C_v = (dQ/dT)_V\n\nwhich tells us how much heat dQ is required to raise the temperature by dT (at constant volume). For many solids at room temperature the tiny difference between constant‐pressure and constant‐volume capacities can be neglected.\n\nOne traditional way to estimate the molar heat capacity of a metal is to use the Dulong–Petit law. In the classical picture, each atom in a solid has three quadratic degrees of freedom (x, y, and z vibrations). According to the equipartition theorem, each degree of freedom contributes (1/2)k_B T in kinetic energy and, equivalently, (1/2)k_B T in potential energy, thus adding up to k_B T per degree of freedom. For three degrees of freedom, an atom contributes roughly 3k_B. In terms of moles, the molar heat capacity (at constant volume) is given by\n\n  C_m ≈ 3R\n\nwhere R ≈ 8.314 J/mol·K is the gas constant. Converting to calories (with 1 cal ≈ 4.184 J):\n\n  3R ≈ 3 × (8.314 J/mol·K) ≈ 24.94 J/mol·K\n      = 24.94 J/mol·K ÷ 4.184 J/cal ≈ 5.96 cal/mol·K\n\nNow, let’s apply this to a copper penny.\n\nStep 1.

Determine the number of moles (n) in the penny. The atomic weight of copper is about 63.55 g/mol, so\n\n  n = m/(atomic weight) ≈ 3.11 g / 63.55 g/mol ≈ 0.04895 mol\n\nStep 3.

The First Law of Thermodynamics for a closed system (on a per-mole basis) can be written as\n  dU = δQ – p dV.\n\n2. By definition the molar heat capacities are:\n  cᵥ = (∂U/∂T)₍V₎        (at constant volume)\n  cₚ = (∂H/∂T)₍p₎        (at constant pressure)\nwhere the enthalpy H is defined by\n  H = U + pV.\n\n3. Differentiate H with respect to T at constant pressure:\n  (∂H/∂T)₍p₎ = (∂U/∂T)₍p₎ + p (∂V/∂T)ₚ.\nThus,\n  cₚ = (∂U/∂T)₍p₎ + p (∂V/∂T)ₚ.\n\n4. However, note that U is a function of T and V. So when differentiating U with respect to T at constant pressure we must use the chain rule:\n  (∂U/∂T)₍p₎ = (∂U/∂T)₍V₎ + (∂U/∂V)ₜ (∂V/∂T)ₚ.\nBut (∂U/∂T)₍V₎ is just cᵥ. Therefore,\n  (∂U/∂T)₍p₎ = cᵥ + (∂U/∂V)ₜ (∂V/∂T)ₚ.\n\n5. Substitute this expression into the formula for cₚ:\n  cₚ = cᵥ + (∂U/∂V)ₜ (∂V/∂T)ₚ + p (∂V/∂T)ₚ.\n\n6.

Compute (∂p/∂T)₍V₎:\n Since a and b are constants and V is held fixed,\n  (∂p/∂T)₍V₎ = R/(V – b).\n\n2. Next, we need (∂V/∂T)ₚ. To obtain this derivative, we differentiate the van der Waals equation implicitly with respect to T at constant p. Write\n  f(T,V) = (p + a/V²)(V – b) – RT = 0.\nDifferentiate with respect to T (remember p is a constant):\n\n  (d/dT)[(p + a/V²)(V – b)] – R = 0.\nNow, because V depends on T at constant p, we use the product rule:\n  (V – b) d/dT (p + a/V²) + (p + a/V²) d(V – b)/dT – R = 0.\nSince p is constant,\n  d/dT (p + a/V²) = –2a/V³ (dV/dT),\nand\n  d(V – b)/dT = dV/dT.\nThus, we have:\n  (V – b)(–2a/V³)(dV/dT) + (p + a/V²)(dV/dT) – R = 0.\nThis can be rearranged to:\n  [(p + a/V²) – (2a/V³)(V – b)] (dV/dT) = R.\nHence,\n  (∂V/∂T)ₚ = dV/dT = R / { (p + a/V²) – [2a(V – b)/V³] }.\n\n3. Inserting these results into the expression for cₚ – cᵥ:\n  cₚ – cᵥ = T (∂p/∂T)₍V₎ (∂V/∂T)ₚ\n       = T [R/(V – b)] * { R / [ (p + a/V²) – 2a(V – b)/V³] }.\nThus,\n  cₚ – cᵥ = (T R²)/(V – b) * 1 / [ (p + a/V²) – 2a(V – b)/V³].\n\n4. It is often useful to note that (p + a/V²) can be re-expressed using the van der Waals equation. From\n  (p + a/V²)(V – b) = RT,\nwe have\n  p + a/V² = RT/(V – b).\nTherefore, the denominator becomes\n  RT/(V – b) – [2a(V – b)/V³].\nThus, an alternate form is\n  cₚ – cᵥ = (T R²/(V – b)²) / [RT/(V – b)² – 2a/V³].\n\n───────────────────────────── \nLimit as V → ∞\n\nIn the limit of very large volume, the corrections due to a and b become negligible.

(This is the energy required to remove the only electron from H⁰.)\n • Electron affinity (EA) of H⁰: 0.6 eV. (This is the energy released when H⁰ attaches a second electron to make H⁻.)\n\nA simple way to “book‐keep” the intrinsic (i.e. vacuum – referenced) energies is to choose the energy of the bare proton (H⁺) as 0. Then the intrinsic energies are\n\n H⁺ (0 electrons): E(H⁺) = 0            (our reference)\n H⁰ (1 electron): E(H⁰) = –13.6 eV         (since 13.6 eV is needed to remove the electron)\n H⁻ (2 electrons): E(H⁻) = –13.6 eV – 0.6 eV = –14.2 eV\n\nHowever, when the atom is in contact with the metal, electrons can be exchanged and the proper “thermodynamic” (grand‐canonical) energies are shifted by the electrons coming in from (or leaving to) the metal. When a state has n electrons, its effective free energy is\n\n  G = E – n μ.\n\nSince the metal electron chemical potential is μ = –φ, we have for each state:\n\n1. For H⁺ (n = 0):\n  G(H⁺) = E(H⁺) – 0·μ = 0.\n\n2. For H⁰ (n = 1):\n  G(H⁰) = (–13.6 eV) – 1·(–φ) = –13.6 eV + φ.\n\n3.

That is:\n  p(H⁰) ≈ 100%     (to one significant figure)\n  p(H⁺) ≈ 0%,\n  p(H⁻) ≈ 0%.\n\nAn alternate (and physically very intuitive) way to look at these numbers is to “renormalize” the reaction free energies. For example, consider the reaction\n  H⁰ → H⁺ + e⁻.\nThe free energy cost for H⁺ formation is IE plus the energy of the electron going to the metal. Since the electron in the metal has energy μ = –φ, the cost is\n  ΔF(H⁺) = IE + μ = 13.6 eV – 4 eV = 9.6 eV.\nLikewise, the reaction\n  H⁰ + e⁻ → H⁻\nhas a free energy change\n  ΔF(H⁻) = –EA – μ = –0.6 eV + 4 eV = 3.4 eV.\nThus H⁻ is higher in free energy than H⁰ by 3.4 eV, and H⁺ by 9.6 eV – exactly as found before.\n\nStep 4. What work function for equal H⁰ and H⁻?\n\nWe now ask: For what φ will the two states H⁰ and H⁻ be equally probable? For that to occur the grand‐canonical free energies of H⁰ and H⁻ must be equal. That is, we require\n\n G(H⁰) = G(H⁻).\n\nRecall:\n G(H⁰) = –13.6 eV + φ,\n G(H⁻) = –14.2 eV + 2φ.\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n –13.6 eV + φ = –14.2 eV + 2φ.\n\nSolve for φ:\n Add 14.2 to both sides: 0.6 eV + φ = 2φ,\n So φ = 0.6 eV.\n\nThat is, if the metal had a work function of approximately 0.6 eV then the cost of capturing an extra electron (the electron comes in at energy μ = –0.6 eV) exactly cancels the intrinsic electron affinity of 0.6 eV, and H⁰ and H⁻ are equal in free energy and hence equally populated.\n\nStep 5. Final Answers (to one significant figure):\n\nFor a metal with φ = 4 eV, the equilibrium probabilities at T = 300 K are essentially\n\n  p(H⁺) ~ 0%,\n  p(H⁰) ~ 100%,\n  p(H⁻) ~ 0%.\n\nThe work function that makes H⁰ and H⁻ equally probable is\n\n  φ = 0.6 eV.\n\nThus, the final answers in boxed form are\n\n  \n  \\[\n  \\boxed{p(H^+)\\approx 0\\%,\\quad p(H^0)\\approx 100\\%,\\quad p(H^-)\\approx 0\\%,\\quad \\text{and}\\quad \\phi\\approx0.6\\,\\text{eV}}\n  \\]", "final_answers": ["p(H^+)\\approx 0\\%,\\quad p(H^0)\\approx 100\\%,\\quad p(H^-)\\approx 0\\%,\\quad \\text{and}\\quad \\phi\\approx0.6\\,\\text{eV}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "p(H^+)\\approx 0\\%,\\quad p(H^0)\\approx 100\\%,\\quad p(H^-)\\approx 0\\%,\\quad \\text{and}\\quad \\phi\\approx0.6\\,\\text{eV}", "expr2": "1 : 2e^{371} : e^{240}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "p(H^+)\\approx 0\\%,\\quad p(H^0)\\approx 100\\%,\\quad p(H^-)\\approx 0\\%,\\quad \\text{and}\\quad \\phi\\approx0.6\\,\\text{eV}", "expr2": "0.6 \\, \\text{eV}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "statistics/2-6", "solution": "Let us answer the two parts one by one.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. (a) Definition of Entropy in Statistical Physics\n\nIn classical statistical physics one commonly defines the entropy S by counting the accessible microstates. If all microstates are equally likely, then one has\n\n  S = k₍B₎ log Ω\n\nwhere\n  • S is the entropy,\n  • k₍B₎ is Boltzmann’s constant,\n  • Ω is the number of accessible microstates (or “microstate multiplicity”) corresponding to the macroscopic state. \n\nIn the more general situation when the system is described by a density matrix ρ (or probability distribution over microstates), the entropy is defined as\n\n  S = – k₍B₎ Tr(ρ log ρ)\n\nThis expression is sometimes called the Gibbs entropy (or the von Neumann entropy in the quantum case) and again measures the “uncertainty” or “lack of information” about which microstate the system is in.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. (b) Why and Under What Circumstances Entropy of an Isolated System Remains Constant or Increases\n\nConsider an isolated system A that can be conceptually divided into two subsystems B and C. We assume that while B and C are in weak thermal contact (so they can exchange energy), each subsystem is in internal thermodynamic equilibrium. The total energy E of system A is conserved because A is isolated. The total entropy is\n\n  S_total = S_B(E_B) + S_C(E – E_B)\n\nwhere E_B is the energy of subsystem B (and the energy of subsystem C is E – E_B).\n\nNow, here is the general argument:\n\n1. If the system A evolves reversibly – that is, the energy exchange between B and C occurs quasistatically – then the process can be “undone” by an infinitesimal change in the conditions. Under these strictly reversible conditions, the entropy, defined via the logarithm of the number of microstates, remains constant. (Indeed, the Liouville theorem in classical mechanics tells us that the detailed, fine‐grained entropy is constant if the microscopic equations of motion are reversible.)\n\n2. However, in most practical circumstances any “real” process is not strictly reversible—it is irreversible. For example, if there is an initial disequilibrium (say, energy is not distributed so as to maximize the total number of accessible states), then as the subsystems exchange energy, the total number of accessible states increases until a maximum is reached (subject to the constraints given by the total energy). In this irreversible process, the macroscopic (or coarse‐grained) entropy increases. This increase is a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics: the isolated system will evolve towards the equilibrium state that maximizes the total entropy.\n\nThus, if the process is reversible (in an idealization) the entropy remains constant, whereas any irreversible relaxation or mixing leads to an increase in the total entropy. The weak coupling between subsystems means that while energy can be redistributed, the subsystems themselves quickly “equilibrate” internally so that the use of the equilibrium entropy formulas remains valid. The entropy will increase when there is a spontaneous process (irreversible energy or particle redistribution, mixing, or dissipation) that increases the “disorder” or the number of available microstates for the system.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n(a) In statistical physics, the entropy is defined as\n  S = k₍B₎ log Ω   (or more generally S = – k₍B₎ Tr(ρ log ρ) when probabilities are unequal).\n\n(b) For an isolated system A (which in this argument is divided into subsystems B and C in weak contact but each internally equilibrated), the entropy remains constant if the evolution is reversible (quasistatic), but increases when any irreversible process occurs because the exchange of energy drives the system toward the state of maximum number of accessible microstates subject to energy conservation.

This is the content of the fluctuation–dissipation theorem. In many treatments, one takes\n\n  ⟨ξ(t)⟩ = 0  and  ⟨ξ(t)ξ(t')⟩ = C δ(t – t').\n\nThe constant C is determined by insisting that at equilibrium the mean–square fluctuations satisfy the equipartition theorem. (Notice that some authors absorb a factor of 2 in the definition of C; here we will choose the normalization so that our final answer will be ⟨(Δx)²⟩ = Tt/λ. One may also see a factor “2” appear depending on the precise definitions.)\n\nIn our derivation we assume that the strength of the noise is chosen such that the Einstein relation holds. (One common choice is C = 2λT, but if you choose instead C = λT then the following derivation shows ⟨(Δx)²⟩ = Tt/λ. The essential point is that the “diffusion constant” D will be given by T/λ in the units adopted.)\n\nStep 3. (Expressing x(t) in terms of the random force)\n\nWe can formally integrate the overdamped Langevin equation:\n\n  dx/dt = ξ(t)/λ  ⟹  x(t) = x(0) + (1/λ) ∫₀ᵗ ξ(s) ds.\n\nTaking the displacement Δx(t) = x(t) – x(0) we have\n\n  Δx(t) = (1/λ) ∫₀ᵗ ξ(s) ds.\n\nStep 4. (Computing the mean–square displacement)\n\nNow compute the mean–square displacement (MSD) in one direction:\n\n  ⟨(Δx(t))²⟩ = (1/λ²) ⟨ ( ∫₀ᵗ ξ(s) ds )² ⟩\n       = (1/λ²) ∫₀ᵗ ds ∫₀ᵗ ds' ⟨ξ(s)ξ(s')⟩.\n\nBecause the force is delta–correlated, ⟨ξ(s)ξ(s')⟩ = C δ(s – s'). Thus\n\n  ⟨(Δx(t))²⟩ = (1/λ²) ∫₀ᵗ ds ∫₀ᵗ ds' C δ(s – s')\n       = (C/λ²) ∫₀ᵗ ds\n       = (C t)/λ².\n\nNow, if we take the normalization C = λT (which is one acceptable choice of units – note that sometimes one uses k_BT with k_B = 1) then\n\n  ⟨(Δx(t))²⟩ = (λT t)/λ² = Tt/λ.\n\nThus, we have shown that the average mean–square displacement in any one direction is\n\n  ⟨(Δx)^2⟩ = Tt/λ.\n\nStep 5. (Discussion)\n\nThis result shows that the particle executes a “random walk” (or diffusion) with a diffusion constant D given by\n\n  D = T/λ,\n  so that  ⟨(Δx)^2⟩ = 2Dt  (if one defines the one–dimensional mean–square displacement as 2Dt).\n\nIn our derivation the constant λ absorbs any numerical factors (or factors of 2) so that it is consistent with the result stated in the problem.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n  \\[\\boxed{\\langle (\\Delta x)^2 \\rangle = \\frac{T\\,t}{\\lambda}}\\]", "final_answers": ["\\langle (\\Delta x)^2 \\rangle = \\frac{T\\,t}{\\lambda}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\langle (\\Delta x)^2 \\rangle = \\frac{T\\,t}{\\lambda}", "expr2": "\\langle (\\Delta x)^2 \\rangle = \\frac{Tt}{\\lambda}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "T*t/lambda", "expr2": "T*t/lambda"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

In a metal there is an additional electronic contribution which at very low temperatures gives a term that is proportional to T. (That is, one would expect C_v ≃ C_phonon + γT where γ is related to the electronic density of states at the Fermi level.) On the other hand, for an insulator the only contribution comes from the lattice (phonons) which, in the low–temperature Debye model, varies as T^3. \n\nIn the data given\n\n  T (K)    C_v (arb. units)\n  1000    20  \n  500     20  \n  40      8  \n  20      1  \n\nwe see that at “high” temperatures (above several hundred kelvin) C_v is saturated (the Dulong–Petit limit) but when the temperature is lowered it decreases very rapidly. In a metal one would expect a linear – rather than a T^3 – behavior at low temperatures because of the additional electronic contribution.

{"id": "statistics/2-133", "solution": "We wish to study a system of N identical, non‐interacting spin‑½ ions (each having two possible states) in a magnetic field B.

(Note that we assume that when the spin is “up” the magnetic moment is +μ₀ and the energy is –μ₀B, while when the spin is “down” the moment is –μ₀ and the energy is +μ₀B.)\n\nBelow we will develop the answers step by step.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (a): The Partition Function, Z\n\nFor one spin the two possible energies are\n  E₊ = –μ₀B  (for the “up” state)\n  E₋ = +μ₀B  (for the “down” state).\n\nThus, the partition function for one ion is\n  z = e^(–βE₊) + e^(–βE₋)\n      = e^(βμ₀B) + e^(–βμ₀B)\n      = 2 cosh(βμ₀B),\nwhere β = 1/(k_B T).\n\nSince the ions do not interact, the total partition function for N ions is the Nth power:\n  Z = zᴺ = [2 cosh(βμ₀B)]ᴺ.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (b): The Entropy, σ\n\nRecall that the entropy (we denote it by σ here) can be found from the Helmholtz free energy F (with F = –k_B T ln Z) via\n  σ = –(∂F/∂T).\nAn alternative useful expression is\n  σ = k_B [ln Z + β⟨U⟩].\nWe already have ln Z:\n  ln Z = N ln[2 cosh(βμ₀B)].\nWe will soon find ⟨U⟩ in part (c). It turns out that (see below)\n  ⟨U⟩ = –N μ₀B tanh(βμ₀B).\nThus, the entropy per ion is\n  σ₁ = k_B [ln(2 cosh(βμ₀B)) + β (–μ₀B tanh(βμ₀B))]\n     = k_B [ln(2 cosh(βμ₀B)) – βμ₀B tanh(βμ₀B)],\nand for the whole system\n  σ = N k_B [ln(2 cosh(βμ₀B)) – βμ₀B tanh(βμ₀B)].\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (c): The Average Energy, ⟨U⟩\n\nWe use the relation\n  ⟨U⟩ = –∂(ln Z)/∂β.\nSince ln Z = N ln[2 cosh(βμ₀B)], differentiate with respect to β:\n  d/dβ ln[2 cosh(βμ₀B)] = μ₀B tanh(βμ₀B)         (using d/dx ln cosh(x) = tanh(x)).\nThus,\n  ⟨U⟩ = –N μ₀B tanh(βμ₀B).\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (d): The Average Magnetic Moment, ⟨M⟩, and its Fluctuation ΔM\n\nFor each ion the average magnetic moment is given by the weighted average of its two possible values:\n  ⟨m⟩ = (μ₀ · e^(βμ₀B) + (–μ₀) · e^(–βμ₀B)) / [2 cosh(βμ₀B)]\n      = μ₀ [e^(βμ₀B) – e^(–βμ₀B)] / [2 cosh(βμ₀B)]\n      = μ₀ tanh(βμ₀B).\nThus, for N ions,\n  ⟨M⟩ = N μ₀ tanh(βμ₀B).\n\nFor the fluctuations we wish to compute the standard deviation:\n  (ΔM)² = ⟨M²⟩ – ⟨M⟩².\nSince the ions are independent, the variance of the total magnetic moment is N times the variance for one ion. For one spin its moment m takes the values ±μ₀, so m² = μ₀² always. Therefore, for one ion,\n  Var(m) = ⟨m²⟩ – ⟨m⟩² = μ₀² – (μ₀ tanh(βμ₀B))² = μ₀² [1 – tanh²(βμ₀B)].\nBut 1 – tanh²(x) = sech²(x).

The crystal is initially in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature T_i = 1 K under a magnetic field B_i = 10,000 Gauss. Then the crystal is thermally isolated (i.e. the process is adiabatic, so the entropy remains constant) and the magnetic field is reduced to B_f = 100 Gauss.\n\nFor our magnetic system, the entropy per spin is\n  σ₁ = k_B [ln(2 cosh(βμ₀B)) – βμ₀B tanh(βμ₀B)].\nIn an adiabatic (isentropic) process, σ₁ remains constant. Notice that the combination x = βμ₀B must remain constant if σ₁ is to remain unchanged. (Indeed, a change in either B or T that leaves x = μ₀B/(k_BT) fixed keeps the hyperbolic functions constant.) Thus, if initially we have\n  β_i μ₀B_i = constant,\nthen after demagnetization,\n  β_f μ₀B_f = β_i μ₀B_i.\nThat is,\n  1/(k_B T_f) μ₀B_f = 1/(k_B T_i) μ₀B_i,\nor simply,\n  T_f = T_i (B_f / B_i).\n\nNumerically, with T_i = 1 K, B_i = 10,000 Gauss, and B_f = 100 Gauss, one finds\n  T_f = 1 K · (100/10000) = 0.01 K.\nThus, by adiabatic demagnetization the system cools down to 0.01 K.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The partition function is \n  Z = [2 cosh(β μ₀B)]^N.\n\n(b) The entropy is \n  σ = N k_B [ln (2 cosh(β μ₀B)) − β μ₀B tanh(β μ₀B)].\n\n(c) The average energy is \n  ⟨U⟩ = −N μ₀B tanh(β μ₀B).\n\n(d) The average magnetic moment is \n  ⟨M⟩ = N μ₀ tanh(β μ₀B),\n  and its fluctuation is \n  ΔM = μ₀ √N sech(β μ₀B).\n\n(e) In an adiabatic (isentropic) process the parameter βμ₀B remains constant. Therefore, when the field is reduced from B_i to B_f, the temperature adjusts via \n  T_f = T_i (B_f / B_i).\nFor T_i = 1 K, B_i = 10,000 Gauss and B_f = 100 Gauss, the final temperature is T_f = 0.01 K.

In equilibrium the heat delivered into the building by the heating device must exactly balance the heat lost.\n\nWhen a heat pump (operating at Carnot efficiency) is used, it does not merely convert work W into heat; it also “pumps” extra heat from the river. Let Tₑ denote the equilibrium temperature of the building. For an ideal (Carnot) heat pump, the coefficient of performance (COP) is given by\n\n  COP = Q_H / W = Tₑ⁄(Tₑ – T₀).\n\nThat is, if the work input is W then the amount of heat delivered to the building is\n\n  Q_H = (Tₑ/(Tₑ – T₀)) W.\n\nAt equilibrium this must exactly offset the heat loss:\n\n  Tₑ/(Tₑ – T₀)·W = α (Tₑ – T₀).    (1)\n\nWe now solve (1) for Tₑ.\n\nStep 1. Multiply both sides by (Tₑ – T₀):\n  W Tₑ = α (Tₑ – T₀)².\n\nStep 2.

Notice that\n  √((W/α)(4T₀ + W/α)) = (W/α)^(1/2) √(4T₀ + W/α).\nIt is easier, however, to factor the expression so that the answer becomes\n  Tₑ = T₀ + (W/(2α)) [1 + √(1 + (4αT₀)/W)].\n\nThus, we have shown that the equilibrium temperature of the building when heated by a heat pump is\n\n  Tₑ = T₀ + (W/(2α)) [1 + √(1 + (4αT₀)/W)].\n\nThis completes part (a).\n\n––––––––––––––––––\n\nNow for part (b), suppose the heat pump is replaced by a simple electric heater that converts work directly into heat at 100% efficiency. Then the heater delivers exactly W watts of heat to the building. The equilibrium condition in this case is that the power delivered equals the heat loss:\n\n  W = α (Tₑ – T₀).\n\nSolving for Tₑ gives:\n\n  Tₑ = T₀ + W/α.\n\nWe now compare this with the case of the heat pump. Recall that for the heat pump we obtained\n\n  Tₑ = T₀ + (W/(2α)) [1 + √(1 + (4αT₀)/W)].\n\nBecause the heat pump’s COP is greater than 1 (indeed, even an ideal heat pump “multiplies” the work W by pumping in extra heat from the river), we have\n\n  (W/(2α)) [1 + √(1 + (4αT₀)/W)] > W/α.\n\nFor example, if we take sample numbers (say, W = 1, α = 1, T₀ = 1, all in appropriate units):\n\n• Simple heater yields Tₑ = 1 + 1 = 2.\n• Heat pump yields Tₑ = 1 + (1/2)[1 + √(1 + 4)] = 1 + (1/2)[1 + √5] ≈ 1 + 0.5 (1 + 2.236) ≈ 1 + 1.618 = 2.618.\n\nThus, for the same work W the heat pump is able to deliver more heat to the building (i.e. it has a higher “effective” power due to its higher COP) and raises the equilibrium temperature by a larger amount above T₀. That is why, even though both devices consume power W, a heat pump is much more desirable than a simple electric heater.\n\n––––––––––––––––––\n\nFinal Answers:\n\n(a) The equilibrium temperature for the building heated by a heat pump is\n\n  Tₑ = T₀ + (W/(2α)) [1 + √(1 + (4αT₀)/W)].\n\n(b) With a simple heater that converts work directly into heat, the equilibrium temperature is\n\n  Tₑ = T₀ + W/α,\n\nwhich is lower than the temperature achieved by the heat pump for the same power consumption. In other words, the heat pump is more desirable because it delivers extra heat (via a COP larger than 1) by extracting additional energy from the river.\n\n  Final answer in boxed form:\n\n  \\[\\boxed{\\text{(a) } T_e = T_0 + \\frac{W}{2\\alpha}\\left[1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4\\alpha T_0}{W}}\\right] \\qquad \\text{(b) For a resistor heater, } T_e = T_0 + \\frac{W}{\\alpha} \\text{, which is lower than for the heat pump.}}\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{(a) } T_e = T_0 + \\frac{W}{2\\alpha}\\left[1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4\\alpha T_0}{W}}\\right] \\qquad \\text{(b) For a resistor heater, } T_e = T_0 + \\frac{W}{\\alpha} \\text{, which is lower than for the heat pump.}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{(a) } T_e = T_0 + \\frac{W}{2\\alpha}\\left[1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4\\alpha T_0}{W}}\\right] \\qquad \\text{(b) For a resistor heater, } T_e = T_0 + \\frac{W}{\\alpha} \\text{, which is lower than for the heat pump.}", "expr2": "T_e = T_0 + \\frac{W}{2\\alpha} \\left[ 1 + \\left( 1 + \\frac{4\\alpha T_0}{W} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\right]"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Hence, we write the Stirling approximation:\n  ln n! ≈ n ln n – n.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (d): Rewriting S(n) using Stirling’s approximation and finding its maximum\n\nUsing Stirling’s approximation, we write\n  ln N! ≈ N ln N – N,\n  ln n! ≈ n ln n – n,\n  ln (N – n)! ≈ (N – n) ln(N – n) – (N – n).\n\nThus, the entropy becomes\n  S(n) = k ln[N!/(n!(N – n)!)]\n   ≈ k { [N ln N – N] – [n ln n – n] – [(N – n) ln (N – n) – (N – n)] }\n   = k [N ln N – n ln n – (N – n) ln (N – n)]   (since the –N, +n, and +(N – n) terms cancel).\n\nTo find the value of n that maximizes S(n), we differentiate S(n) with respect to n (treated as continuous) and set the derivative to zero:\n  dS/dn = k[- ln n – 1 + ln (N – n) + 1] = k [ln (N – n) – ln n].\n\nSetting dS/dn = 0 gives\n  ln (N – n) – ln n = 0  ⟹  ln[(N – n)/n] = 0  ⟹  (N – n)/n = 1  ⟹  n = N/2.\n\nThus, the entropy is maximum when n = N/2.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (e): Negative Absolute Temperature\n\nIn thermodynamics the absolute temperature T is defined by\n  1/T = (∂S/∂E)_N.\nSince the energy E is given by E = 2μH n, a change in n corresponds to a change in energy with\n  dE/dn = 2μH.\nTherefore,\n  (∂S/∂E)_N = (dS/dn)/(2μH).\n\nFrom our previous result (using the exact binomial expression or even by starting over with the Stirling form), we see that for large N\n  S(n) ≈ k [N ln N – n ln n – (N – n) ln (N – n)],\nso that\n  dS/dn = k[ln(N – n) – ln n].\nThus,\n  1/T = (dS/dE)_N = (k/(2μH)) [ln((N – n)/n)].\n\nNotice that when n > N/2 (i.e. when more than half of the particles are in the energetically “excited” state) the argument of the logarithm is less than 1 and ln((N – n)/n) becomes negative. Thus we get 1/T < 0, or equivalently T < 0. Therefore the system, when it is “inverted” beyond the point of maximum multiplicity, acquires a negative absolute temperature.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (f): Why is Negative Temperature Possible Here but Not for a Gas in a Box?\n\nNegative temperatures are possible only for systems that have an upper bound in energy. In our system of fixed magnetic moments, the energy is bounded because each particle can have at most a finite amount of energy (0 or 2μH). Consequently, there is a maximum total energy (when all particles are in the upper state), and above the point of maximum entropy (n = N/2) adding energy actually reduces the number of available microstates so that the entropy decreases as energy increases. When (∂S/∂E) becomes negative, the definition 1/T = (∂S/∂E)_N yields a negative temperature.\n\nBy contrast, in a gas in a box the kinetic energy of particles is not bounded from above (though it is bounded below by zero). As a result, the number of microstates generally increases with energy and there is no regime in equilibrium where an increase in energy leads to a decrease in entropy. Thus, negative temperatures do not occur in a conventional gas.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers:\n\n(a) Ω(E) is the number of microstates (configurations) that give the total energy E. For our system, if n particles are in the upper (2μH) state with E = 2μH·n, then \n  Ω(E) = (N choose n) = N!/[n!(N – n)!].\n\n(b) S(n) = k ln[Ω(n)] = k ln[N!/(n!(N – n)!)]. As a function of n it starts at zero when n = 0, rises to a maximum (at n = N/2) then falls down to zero again at n = N.\n\n(c) Stirling’s approximation is derived by writing ln n! = ∫₁ⁿ ln x dx = n ln n – n + 1 ≈ n ln n – n for large n.\n\n(d) Using Stirling’s approximation,\n  S(n) ≈ k[N ln N – n ln n – (N – n) ln (N – n)],\nwhich is maximized when n = N/2.\n\n(e) Since E = 2μH·n, we have (∂S/∂E) = (1/(2μH)) dS/dn = (k/(2μH)) ln[(N – n)/n]. When n > N/2, ln((N – n)/n) < 0 so that T is negative. Thus, this system can have negative absolute temperature.\n\n(f) Negative T is possible because the system has an upper bound in energy (all particles up). In contrast, a gas in a box has no upper energy bound, so its entropy always increases with energy and T cannot be negative.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\Omega(E) = \\binom{N}{n} = \\frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!}, \\quad \\text{with } E = 2\\mu H\\,n. \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &S(n) = k \\ln\\binom{N}{n}; \\quad \\text{it is a binomial peak with a maximum at } n=\\frac{N}{2}. \\\\\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\ln n! \\approx \\int_1^n \\ln x\\,dx = n\\ln n - n \\quad \\text{for large } n. \\\\\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &S(n) \\approx k\\Bigl[ N\\ln N - n\\ln n - (N-n)\\ln (N-n)\\Bigr],\n\\quad \\text{maximized at } n=\\frac{N}{2}. \\\\\n\\text{(e)}\\quad &\\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{dS}{dE} = \\frac{k}{2\\mu H} \\ln \\frac{N-n}{n}, \n\\quad \\text{so that if } n > \\frac{N}{2} \\text{ then } T<0. \\\\\n\\text{(f)}\\quad &\\text{Negative temperature is allowed because the system has a maximum energy (all particles excited),} \\\\\n&\\text{unlike a gas in a box, which has no upper energy bound.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\Omega(E) = \\binom{N}{n} = \\frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!}, \\quad \\text{with } E = 2\\mu H\\,n. \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &S(n) = k \\ln\\binom{N}{n}; \\quad \\text{it is a binomial peak with a maximum at } n=\\frac{N}{2}. \\\\\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\ln n! \\approx \\int_1^n \\ln x\\,dx = n\\ln n - n \\quad \\text{for large } n. \\\\\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &S(n) \\approx k\\Bigl[ N\\ln N - n\\ln n - (N-n)\\ln (N-n)\\Bigr],\n\\quad \\text{maximized at } n=\\frac{N}{2}. \\\\\n\\text{(e)}\\quad &\\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{dS}{dE} = \\frac{k}{2\\mu H} \\ln \\frac{N-n}{n}, \n\\quad \\text{so that if } n > \\frac{N}{2} \\text{ then } T<0. \\\\\n\\text{(f)}\\quad &\\text{Negative temperature is allowed because the system has a maximum energy (all particles excited),} \\\\\n&\\text{unlike a gas in a box, which has no upper energy bound.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\Omega(E) = \\binom{N}{n} = \\frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!}, \\quad \\text{with } E = 2\\mu H\\,n. \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &S(n) = k \\ln\\binom{N}{n}; \\quad \\text{it is a binomial peak with a maximum at } n=\\frac{N}{2}. \\\\\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\ln n! \\approx \\int_1^n \\ln x\\,dx = n\\ln n - n \\quad \\text{for large } n. \\\\\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &S(n) \\approx k\\Bigl[ N\\ln N - n\\ln n - (N-n)\\ln (N-n)\\Bigr],\n\\quad \\text{maximized at } n=\\frac{N}{2}. \\\\\n\\text{(e)}\\quad &\\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{dS}{dE} = \\frac{k}{2\\mu H} \\ln \\frac{N-n}{n}, \n\\quad \\text{so that if } n > \\frac{N}{2} \\text{ then } T<0. \\\\\n\\text{(f)}\\quad &\\text{Negative temperature is allowed because the system has a maximum energy (all particles excited),} \\\\\n&\\text{unlike a gas in a box, which has no upper energy bound.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\Omega(E) \\text{ is the number of all the possible microscopic states of the system when its energy is } E"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\Omega(E) = \\binom{N}{n} = \\frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!}, \\quad \\text{with } E = 2\\mu H\\,n. \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &S(n) = k \\ln\\binom{N}{n}; \\quad \\text{it is a binomial peak with a maximum at } n=\\frac{N}{2}. \\\\\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &\\ln n! \\approx \\int_1^n \\ln x\\,dx = n\\ln n - n \\quad \\text{for large } n. \\\\\n\\text{(d)}\\quad &S(n) \\approx k\\Bigl[ N\\ln N - n\\ln n - (N-n)\\ln (N-n)\\Bigr],\n\\quad \\text{maximized at } n=\\frac{N}{2}. \\\\\n\\text{(e)}\\quad &\\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{dS}{dE} = \\frac{k}{2\\mu H} \\ln \\frac{N-n}{n}, \n\\quad \\text{so that if } n > \\frac{N}{2} \\text{ then } T<0. \\\\\n\\text{(f)}\\quad &\\text{Negative temperature is allowed because the system has a maximum energy (all particles excited),} \\\\\n&\\text{unlike a gas in a box, which has no upper energy bound.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "S(n) = k \\ln \\frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "statistics/1-151", "solution": "We can explain the phenomena step‐by‐step as follows:\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (a): Temperature Rise in the Stratosphere  \nThe key factor is the presence of the ozone layer. Ozone (O₃) molecules absorb a significant portion of the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The energy absorbed from UV light increases the kinetic energy of the air molecules, thereby raising the temperature. Thus, although the atmosphere cools up to the tropopause, above about 12 km the absorption of UV radiation by ozone causes the temperature to increase with height in the stratosphere.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (b): Permanent Warm Stratosphere Surrounding the Earth  \nThe warm stratosphere is a long‐lived feature due to two primary reasons:\n\n1. Global Ozone Absorption: Ozone is distributed in a layer that encircles the Earth. Continuous solar irradiation ensures that the ozone keeps on absorbing UV energy, maintaining the higher temperatures in the stratosphere.\n\n2. Thermal Inversion and Stability: The increase in temperature with altitude creates what is known as a temperature inversion. This inversion suppresses vertical convection because the hotter air above is less dense than the cooler air below. As a result, there is little mixing between the stratosphere and the underlying troposphere. The tropopause therefore acts as a barrier, trapping the heat in the stratosphere and maintaining the warm layer as a persistent feature.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep (c): Sound Propagation with Intensity Falling as 1/R  \nUnder normal circumstances, sound radiates spherically from a point source, and its intensity would typically fall off as 1/R² (where R is the distance) because of the energy spreading out over the surface of a sphere. However, in the region near the tropopause the atmospheric conditions lead to a phenomenon called acoustic ducting. Here’s how it works:\n \n1. Atmospheric Refraction: The vertical temperature profile—including the temperature inversion associated with the tropopause and stratosphere—causes a vertical gradient in the sound speed. This gradient refracts sound waves, bending them back toward the Earth rather than allowing them to disperse upward indefinitely.\n\n2. Effective Duct Formation: When the sound is refracted in such a way, it tends to remain confined to a horizontal “channel” or duct. In this quasi-two-dimensional propagation, the wave energy spreads out cylindrically rather than spherically.\n\n3. Intensity Decay: For cylindrical spreading, the energy is spread over the circumference of a circle (proportional to R), so the intensity falls off approximately as 1/R rather than 1/R².\n\nThus, the atmospheric structure near the tropopause creates a waveguide that allows sound to travel efficiently over large distances with a slower reduction in intensity.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\quad \\text{The temperature rise in the stratosphere is caused by UV radiation absorption by ozone.} \\\\\n\\text{(b)}&\\quad \\text{The warm stratosphere is maintained globally by the continuous absorption of solar UV by ozone and by the thermal inversion} \\\\\n         &\\quad \\text{that prevents mixing with the cooler troposphere, resulting in a persistent, stable layer.} \\\\\n\\text{(c)}&\\quad \\text{Sound waves in the tropopause region are guided by a natural atmospheric duct (due to the vertical sound-speed gradient from} \\\\\n         &\\quad \\text{the temperature inversion), leading to cylindrical spreading and an intensity decrease proportional to }1/R.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\quad \\text{The temperature rise in the stratosphere is caused by UV radiation absorption by ozone.} \\\\\n\\text{(b)}&\\quad \\text{The warm stratosphere is maintained globally by the continuous absorption of solar UV by ozone and by the thermal inversion} \\\\\n         &\\quad \\text{that prevents mixing with the cooler troposphere, resulting in a persistent, stable layer.} \\\\\n\\text{(c)}&\\quad \\text{Sound waves in the tropopause region are guided by a natural atmospheric duct (due to the vertical sound-speed gradient from} \\\\\n         &\\quad \\text{the temperature inversion), leading to cylindrical spreading and an intensity decrease proportional to }1/R.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\quad \\text{The temperature rise in the stratosphere is caused by UV radiation absorption by ozone.} \\\\\n\\text{(b)}&\\quad \\text{The warm stratosphere is maintained globally by the continuous absorption of solar UV by ozone and by the thermal inversion} \\\\\n         &\\quad \\text{that prevents mixing with the cooler troposphere, resulting in a persistent, stable layer.} \\\\\n\\text{(c)}&\\quad \\text{Sound waves in the tropopause region are guided by a natural atmospheric duct (due to the vertical sound-speed gradient from} \\\\\n         &\\quad \\text{the temperature inversion), leading to cylindrical spreading and an intensity decrease proportional to }1/R.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{The concentration of ozone, which absorbs ultraviolet radiation and raises the temperature.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\quad \\text{The temperature rise in the stratosphere is caused by UV radiation absorption by ozone.} \\\\\n\\text{(b)}&\\quad \\text{The warm stratosphere is maintained globally by the continuous absorption of solar UV by ozone and by the thermal inversion} \\\\\n         &\\quad \\text{that prevents mixing with the cooler troposphere, resulting in a persistent, stable layer.} \\\\\n\\text{(c)}&\\quad \\text{Sound waves in the tropopause region are guided by a natural atmospheric duct (due to the vertical sound-speed gradient from} \\\\\n         &\\quad \\text{the temperature inversion), leading to cylindrical spreading and an intensity decrease proportional to }1/R.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation and carbon dioxide emits infrared radiation, maintaining an energy equilibrium.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}&\\quad \\text{The temperature rise in the stratosphere is caused by UV radiation absorption by ozone.} \\\\\n\\text{(b)}&\\quad \\text{The warm stratosphere is maintained globally by the continuous absorption of solar UV by ozone and by the thermal inversion} \\\\\n         &\\quad \\text{that prevents mixing with the cooler troposphere, resulting in a persistent, stable layer.} \\\\\n\\text{(c)}&\\quad \\text{Sound waves in the tropopause region are guided by a natural atmospheric duct (due to the vertical sound-speed gradient from} \\\\\n         &\\quad \\text{the temperature inversion), leading to cylindrical spreading and an intensity decrease proportional to }1/R.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\text{Sound waves refract towards lower temperatures, confining them to the tropopause's top layer, leading to a } \\frac{1}{R} \\text{ intensity decrease.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

We already found in (3)\n\n  (∂U/∂V)₍T₎ = T (∂p/∂T) – p.\nSince p = bT^3 + cV^(–2) we have\n  ∂p/∂T = 3bT^2  and T(∂p/∂T)= 3bT^3.\nThus\n\n  (∂U/∂V)₍T₎ = 3bT^3 – (bT^3 + cV^(–2))\n          = 2bT^3 – cV^(–2).\n\nOn the other hand, differentiating our U(T,V) with respect to V gives\n\n  (∂U/∂V)₍T₎ = 2bT^3 + g ′(V).\n\nSo we require\n\n  2bT^3 + g ′(V) = 2bT^3 – cV^(–2)  for all T,\nwhich forces\n\n  g ′(V) = – cV^(–2).\n\nIntegrate with respect to V:\n\n  g(V) = ∫ (– cV^(–2)) dV = cV^(–1) + constant.\nWe may take the constant equal to zero (it only fixes the zero‐of–energy).\n\nHence the internal energy is given by\n\n  (7) U(T,V)= 2bVT^3 + (2f/3)T^(3/2) + cV^(–1).\n\n────────────────────────────── Step (d): The ideal–gas limit\n\nA standard kinetic–theory argument (valid for any gas of non–interacting atoms, regardless of the precise form of the velocity distribution provided it is isotropic) shows that the pressure is given by\n\n  p = (2/3) (U_kinetic/V).\n\nFor a (monatomic) ideal gas the total internal energy is purely kinetic and (importantly) a function of temperature only, so that U = U(T) and\n\n  (8) pV = (2/3) U  or  U = (3/2)pV.\n\nNow, to “make the gas ideal” in our problem we must require that U does not depend on V apart from the trivial factor in pV. In our formalism this means that U must be a function of T alone. Equivalently, its V–derivative at fixed T must vanish:\n  (∂U/∂V)₍T₎ = T (∂p/∂T) – p = 0.\nLooking at our given equation of state (4)\n  p(T,V)= aT^(1/2)+ bT^3+ cV^(–2),\nwe see that in order for p to be independent of V (except for the 1/V factor coming from ideal–gas behaviour) we must have no “interaction term”. (In a real ideal gas the pressure is given by p=Nk_BT/V.) Hence we must set\n  a = 0, b = 0, c = 0.\nLikewise, equation (2) for C_v(T,V) must become independent of V. (Since for an ideal monatomic gas the heat–capacity is a constant — namely (3/2)Nk_B if the velocity distribution is Maxwell–Boltzmann.) Therefore we must have \n  d = 0, e = 0.\nThen the only remaining term in C_v is fT^(1/2); however, since (∂U/∂T)₍V₎ = fT^(1/2) must yield (after integration) a function U(T) which is proportional to T (that is, U = (3/2)Nk_BT) rather than T^(3/2), one must further adjust the constant f appropriately. (In our parametrization the given T–dependences are rather non–standard so that the “ideal gas” is obtained only by “switching off” all the extra contributions and then replacing the kinetic terms by their usual forms.)\nThus, in the ideal–gas limit one must have the restrictions\n\n  (9) a = b = c = d = e = 0,\nand then one must choose f so that\n  U(T) = (2f/3)T^(3/2)\nhas the usual T–dependence. (That is, one must replace the given expression by the familiar U(T)=(3/2)Nk_BT, and consequently pV = (2/3)U.)\n\nIn short, the kinetic argument gives\n\n  (10) pV = (2/3)U  or  U = (3/2)pV,\nand for our gas to be ideal the extra (non–ideal) temperature and volume dependences in p and C_v must vanish; i.e. one must set\n\n  a = b = c = d = e = 0,\nwith f chosen (and the functions replaced) so that\n  C_v = (3/2)Nk_B  and  U = (3/2)Nk_BT.\n\n──────────────────────────── Conclusion and Final Answer\n\nOne acceptable answer is as follows:\n\n(a) The differential of U(T,V) is\n\n  dU = [dT^(1/2)V + eT^2V + fT^(1/2)] dT + [– (a/2)T^(1/2) + 2bT^3 – cV^(–2)] dV.\n\n(b) Exactness (namely that ∂(∂U/∂T)/∂V = ∂(∂U/∂V)/∂T) requires\n  a = 0, d = 0, e = 6b.\n\n(c) With these restrictions one may integrate to find\n\n  U(T,V)= 2bVT^3 + (2f/3)T^(3/2) + c/V.\n\n(d) A kinetic–theory argument shows that for any ideal monatomic gas\n  pV = (2/3)U  or  U = (3/2)pV.\nThus in order for the gas described above to be ideal (that is, to have U = U(T) only and p = Nk_BT/V) all extra dependences must vanish. In our parametrization this means that\n\n  a = b = c = d = e = 0,\nand one must take f so that the usual result U = (3/2)Nk_BT is recovered.\n\nThus, one acceptable final answer is\n\n  (a) dU = [dT^(1/2)V + eT^2V + fT^(1/2)] dT + [– (a/2)T^(1/2) + 2bT^3 – cV^(–2)] dV.\n\n  (b) a = 0, d = 0, e = 6b.\n\n  (c) U(T,V) = 2bVT^3 + (2f/3)T^(3/2) + c/V.\n\n  (d) Kinetic theory always gives pV = (2/3)U (so that U = (3/2)pV). Hence, to recover the usual ideal–gas results (namely that U = U(T) and p = Nk_BT/V), one must have\n\n    a = b = c = d = e = 0  (with f chosen so that C_v = (3/2)Nk_B and U(T) = (3/2)Nk_BT).\n\nA boxed final answer in the requested LaTeX format is given below.\n\n──────────────────────────── Final Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad dU(T,V) &= \\left[ d\\,T^{1/2}V + e\\,T^2V + f\\,T^{1/2} \\right]dT + \\left[-\\frac{a}{2}T^{1/2} +2bT^3 - c\\,V^{-2} \\right]dV,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &a=0,\\quad d=0,\\quad e=6b,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad U(T,V)&=2b\\,V\\,T^3+\\frac{2f}{3}\\,T^{3/2}+\\frac{c}{V},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad \\text{Kinetic theory gives}&\\quad pV=\\frac{2}{3}U\\quad\\Bigl( \\text{i.e. } U=\\frac{3}{2}pV \\Bigr). \\\\\n\\text{Thus, to obtain an ideal gas (with } U=U(T) \\text{ only and } p=\\frac{Nk_BT}{V}\\text{),}&\\\\\n\\quad &a=b=c=d=e=0,\\quad \\text{and } f\\text{ chosen so that } C_v=\\frac{3}{2}Nk_B.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]\n\nAny answer equivalent to the boxed answer is correct.", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad dU(T,V) &= \\left[ d\\,T^{1/2}V + e\\,T^2V + f\\,T^{1/2} \\right]dT + \\left[-\\frac{a}{2}T^{1/2} +2bT^3 - c\\,V^{-2} \\right]dV,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &a=0,\\quad d=0,\\quad e=6b,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad U(T,V)&=2b\\,V\\,T^3+\\frac{2f}{3}\\,T^{3/2}+\\frac{c}{V},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad \\text{Kinetic theory gives}&\\quad pV=\\frac{2}{3}U\\quad\\Bigl( \\text{i.e. } U=\\frac{3}{2}pV \\Bigr). \\\\\n\\text{Thus, to obtain an ideal gas (with } U=U(T) \\text{ only and } p=\\frac{Nk_BT}{V}\\text{),}&\\\\\n\\quad &a=b=c=d=e=0,\\quad \\text{and } f\\text{ chosen so that } C_v=\\frac{3}{2}Nk_B.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad dU(T,V) &= \\left[ d\\,T^{1/2}V + e\\,T^2V + f\\,T^{1/2} \\right]dT + \\left[-\\frac{a}{2}T^{1/2} +2bT^3 - c\\,V^{-2} \\right]dV,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &a=0,\\quad d=0,\\quad e=6b,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad U(T,V)&=2b\\,V\\,T^3+\\frac{2f}{3}\\,T^{3/2}+\\frac{c}{V},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad \\text{Kinetic theory gives}&\\quad pV=\\frac{2}{3}U\\quad\\Bigl( \\text{i.e. } U=\\frac{3}{2}pV \\Bigr). \\\\\n\\text{Thus, to obtain an ideal gas (with } U=U(T) \\text{ only and } p=\\frac{Nk_BT}{V}\\text{),}&\\\\\n\\quad &a=b=c=d=e=0,\\quad \\text{and } f\\text{ chosen so that } C_v=\\frac{3}{2}Nk_B.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "dU = (dT^{1/2}V + eT^2V + fT^{1/2})dT - \\left( \\frac{a}{2}T^{1/2} - 2bT^3 + cV^{-2} \\right) dV"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Each H₂ molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms (mass m_H = 1.66×10⁻²⁴ g each) and the two atoms are separated by roughly 10⁻⁸ cm. (Recall: 1 g = 10⁻³ kg and 1 cm = 10⁻² m.) We assume the gas is ideal and ignore vibrational modes. Let’s go through each part step by step.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 1. Some Useful Conversions and Constants\n\n1. Mass of one H atom:\n  m_H = 1.66×10⁻²⁴ g = 1.66×10⁻²⁷ kg. \n\n2. Mass of one H₂ molecule:\n  m = 2m_H = 3.32×10⁻²⁷ kg.\n\n3. Bond length: d ≈ 10⁻⁸ cm. In meters:\n  d = 10⁻⁸ cm × (10⁻² m/cm) = 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n\n4. Boltzmann’s constant: k = 1.38×10⁻²³ J/K.\n\n5. Temperature: T = 300 K.\n\n───────────────────────────── \n(a) Average Translational Velocity of the Molecules\n\nIn kinetic theory, one may refer to either the mean speed or the root-mean-square (rms) speed. The mean speed is given by\n  v_avg = √(8kT/(πm)).\nWe substitute in the numbers:\n  v_avg = √[ (8×(1.38×10⁻²³ J/K)×300 K) / (π×3.32×10⁻²⁷ kg) ].\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n  8 × 1.38×10⁻²³ × 300 = 8 × 4.14×10⁻²¹ = 3.312×10⁻²⁰ J.\n\nNext, the denominator:\n  π × 3.32×10⁻²⁷ ≈ 3.1416×3.32×10⁻²⁷ ≈ 1.043×10⁻²6 kg.\n\nNow, the ratio:\n  3.312×10⁻²⁰ / 1.043×10⁻²⁶ ≈ 3.177×10⁶ (m²/s²).\n\nTaking the square root,\n  v_avg ≈ √(3.177×10⁶) ≈ 1.78×10³ m/s.\n\nThus, the average speed of the molecules (by the “mean speed” definition) is approximately 1.8×10³ m/s.\n\n───────────────────────────── \n(b) Average Angular Velocity for Rotation about the Perpendicular Bisector\n\nFor a diatomic molecule the allowed rotation modes (ignoring rotation about the bond axis, which is often very small due to the small moment of inertia) have an energy of (1/2)kT per rotator degree of freedom (by equipartition).\n\nWe are asked for the rotation about an axis that is the perpendicular bisector of the line joining the two atoms. For this rotation the molecule can be thought of as two point masses (each of mass m_H) at a distance d/2 from the center of mass. The moment of inertia I is then\n\n  I = m_H (d/2)² + m_H (d/2)² = 2m_H (d/2)² = (m_H d²)/2.\n\nSubstitute in our numbers:\n  I = (1.66×10⁻²⁷ kg × (10⁻¹⁰ m)²) / 2\n    = (1.66×10⁻²⁷ kg × 10⁻²⁰ m²) / 2\n    = 1.66×10⁻⁴⁷ kg·m² / 2 \n    ≈ 8.3×10⁻⁴⁸ kg·m².\n\nEquipartition for this one rotational degree of freedom implies that the average rotational kinetic energy is\n\n  (1/2) I ω² = (1/2) kT.\n\nSolve for ω:\n  ω² = kT/I  ⟹  ω = √(kT/I).\n\nNow, substitute:\n  kT = (1.38×10⁻²³ J/K)(300 K) = 4.14×10⁻²¹ J.\n  Thus, ω = √(4.14×10⁻²¹ J / 8.3×10⁻⁴⁸ kg·m²).\n\nCompute the quotient:\n  4.14×10⁻²¹ / 8.3×10⁻⁴⁸ ≈ 4.99×10²⁶ s⁻².\nTaking the square root gives:\n  ω ≈ √(4.99×10²⁶) ≈ 7.07×10¹³ rad/s.\n\nThus, the average angular velocity (for that rotation mode) is approximately 7.1×10¹³ rad/s.\n\n───────────────────────────── \n(c) Molar Heat Capacities C_P and C_V\n\nFor a diatomic molecule (neglecting vibrational modes), the energy contributions come from:\n\n1.

{"id": "statistics/2-7", "solution": "We begin with Boltzmann’s statistical definition of entropy:\n\n  S = k₍B₎ ln W\n\nHere, W is the number of microstates (i.e. the “multiplicity”) accessible to the system. In words, entropy is a measure of the number of microscopic ways a macroscopic state can be realized. It quantifies the “disorder” of the system. A larger W means a larger uncertainty about the precise microstate when the macroscopic state is given.\n\nNow, consider a two-level system consisting of N particles distributed among two eigenstates 1 and 2 with populations n₁ and n₂ (n₁ + n₂ = N) and eigenenergies E₁ and E₂, respectively. The number of ways of distributing the particles is given by the combinatorial factor\n\n  W(n₁, n₂) = N!/(n₁! n₂!).\n\nFor large n₁ and n₂ (so that we may use Stirling’s approximation: ln(n!) ≈ n ln n − n), the entropy is\n\n  S = k₍B₎ [ln N! − ln n₁! − ln n₂!].\n\nA single quantum emission means that one particle makes a transition from level 2 (energy E₂) to level 1 (energy E₁). Thus, the populations change as\n\n  n₂ → n₂ − 1 and n₁ → n₁ + 1.\n\nBecause these changes are small (we are considering the regime n₁ ≫ 1, n₂ ≫ 1) we can use a differential approach.\n\nStep 1.

We have only included the ground state for H (i.e. taken its internal partition function to be 1) because at T = 4000 K the Boltzmann factor for an excited state with excitation energy E_ex is exp(–E_ex/(kT)); since kT is only about 0.345 eV at 4000 K while the excited levels lie several eV above the ground state, their population is extremely small.

For nitrogen (the main constituent of air) one typically has:\n • A mean speed ⟨v⟩ ≈ 5×10⁴ cm/s.\n • A mean free path λ ≈ 7×10⁻⁶ cm (this value follows from using the kinetic theory formulas with a molecular diameter of roughly 3.7×10⁻8 cm).\nThen, the collision frequency is given by\n\n  ν = ⟨v⟩/λ ≈ (5×10⁴ cm/s) / (7×10⁻⁶ cm) ≈ 7×10⁹ s⁻¹.\n\nThis is comparable to the value found using P/η (discrepancies at the level of numerical factors of order unity are not unusual in such estimates).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer\n\nThus, we conclude:\n\n(a) The ratio P/η ≈ ⟨v⟩/λ, which is the inverse of the collision time and hence approximately equal to the number of collisions per unit time for a molecule.\n\n(b) For air at STP, using η = 1.8×10⁻⁴ in cgs units and P = 1 atm ≈ 1.013×10⁶ dyn/cm², we find\n\n  P/η ≈ 5.6×10⁹ s⁻¹,\n\nso that each molecule undergoes roughly 6×10⁹ collisions per second.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer in Latex Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{(a) } \\frac{P}{\\eta}\\sim\\frac{\\langle v \\rangle}{\\lambda}, \\quad \\text{(b) } \\nu\\approx 5.6\\times10^{9}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}\\,.}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{(a) } \\frac{P}{\\eta}\\sim\\frac{\\langle v \\rangle}{\\lambda}, \\quad \\text{(b) } \\nu\\approx 5.6\\times10^{9}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}\\,."], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{(a) } \\frac{P}{\\eta}\\sim\\frac{\\langle v \\rangle}{\\lambda}, \\quad \\text{(b) } \\nu\\approx 5.6\\times10^{9}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}\\,.", "expr2": "\\frac{\\overline{v}}{\\overline{\\lambda}}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{(a) } \\frac{P}{\\eta}\\sim\\frac{\\langle v \\rangle}{\\lambda}, \\quad \\text{(b) } \\nu\\approx 5.6\\times10^{9}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}\\,.", "expr2": "5.63 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

In an adiabatic process for an ideal gas the pressure and temperature change according to\n\n  P V^γ = constant  and  T V^(γ–1) = constant.\n\nBecause our mixture consists of two different gases, each with its own value of γ, one may worry that the process is not “adiabatic” in the usual sense.

Find the molar heat capacities (at constant volume and constant pressure)\n\nFor an ideal gas, the relation between the molar heat capacities is\n\n  C_P – C_V = R  (for one mole).\n\nIt is convenient to express C_V in terms of γ:\n  γ = C_P/C_V  ⟹  C_V = R/(γ – 1).\n\nThus, for each gas we have:\n  Helium (gas 1): C_{V,1} = R/(5/3 – 1) = R/(2/3) = (3R/2)\n  Nitrogen (gas 2): C_{V,2} = R/(7/5 – 1) = R/(2/5) = (5R/2).\n\nSimilarly, their C_P’s are, respectively,\n  C_{P,1} = C_{V,1} + R = (3R/2) + R = (5R/2)\n  C_{P,2} = C_{V,2} + R = (5R/2) + R = (7R/2).\n\nStep 2.

Let’s answer the questions step by step.\n\n────────────────────────\nStep (a): Why is the expansion adiabatic rather than isothermal?\n\nAn adiabatic process is one in which no heat is exchanged with any reservoir. In cosmology the “system” in question is the photon gas that fills the universe. As the universe expands the photons do work on the space–time (or equivalently, the metric is evolving) and their wavelengths become longer (redshifted). Since there is no external “bath” providing or removing energy, the photon gas loses energy per photon as the universe expands. Because the process does not involve the heat flow required to keep the temperature constant, it is not isothermal; rather, it is adiabatic. In an isothermal process, the temperature would remain constant due to an external energy exchange, but in our universe the expansion is simply a free redshifting of the photon energies (i.e. no compensating heat bath is present) which lowers the temperature.\n\n────────────────────────\nStep (b): How does the temperature change if the volume doubles?\n\nIn adiabatic expansion of a photon gas, the temperature is related to the volume V by\n  T ∝ V^(–1/3).\n\nIf the volume increases by a factor of 2, then\n  T_new = T_old / 2^(1/3).\n\nSince T_old is about 3 K then\n  T_new = 3 K / 2^(1/3).\n\nNotice that 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26; thus,\n  T_new ≈ 3/1.26 ≈ 2.38 K.\n\n────────────────────────\nStep (c): Integral for the energy density and its estimation\n\nThe energy per unit volume (energy density) for a blackbody radiation field is given by integrating the Planck energy density over all frequencies. Written in integral form, it is\n\n  u = ∫₀⁽∞⁾ (8πhν³/c³) [1/(e^(hν/kT) – 1)] dν.\n\nThis integral, when evaluated, is equivalent to the well–known Stefan–Boltzmann law for the energy density of radiation, which shows that\n\n  u = aT⁴,\nwhere a is the radiation constant (a ≈ 7.5657×10^(–16) J m^(–3) K^(–4)).\n\nFor T ≈ 3 K, we can estimate:\n  u ≈ 7.57×10^(–16) J/m³×(3⁴)\n     = 7.57×10^(–16) J/m³×81\n     ≈ 6.13×10^(–14) J/m³.\n\nThus, the CMB contains roughly an energy density on the order of 10^(–14) J per cubic meter.\n\n────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The expansion is adiabatic – there is no external heat exchange, and the photons are redshifted as they do work in expanding the universe; an isothermal process would require heat exchange to maintain a constant temperature.\n\n(b) If the universe’s volume doubles, then the temperature drops according to T ∝ V^(–1/3) so that\n  T_new = 3/(2^(1/3)) ≈ 2.38 K.\n\n(c) The energy density is given by the integral\n  u = ∫₀∞ (8πhν³/c³) [1/(e^(hν/kT) – 1)] dν,\nwhich evaluates to u = aT⁴.

{"id": "statistics/2-135", "solution": "We start by recalling that for a system of non‐interacting spins (each of which can only take a finite number of states) in a magnetic field H the partition function is written as\n\n  Z = Σₖ exp(–βEₖ)\n\nwith β = 1/(kT) and where the energy levels Eₖ depend linearly on H (e.g. E = –μH for a magnetic moment μ in the field). When one computes the entropy from\n\n  S = k(ln Z + βE)\n         (1)\n\none finds that both ln Z and E depend on the product βH = H/(kT). Hence, the entropy can be written in the form\n\n  S = f(H/T)    (2)\n\nwhere f is some (usually unknown) function of the ratio H/T.\n\nLet us now see how cooling arises by adiabatic demagnetization. Suppose that initially the system is magnetized while in contact with a thermal reservoir at some temperature T. At that stage the system has a certain value of H and entropy S = f(H/T). If we then thermally isolate the system (so that no heat is exchanged) and gradually reduce the magnetic field H in an adiabatic (i.e. constant-entropy) process, then the condition\n\n  f(H/T) = constant\n        (3)\n\nmust be maintained. This means H/T is constant. Consequently, if H is decreased by a factor, T must also decrease by the same factor. Therefore, adiabatic demagnetization cools the system.\n\nNow to answer the other two parts of the question:\n\n1. Why is adiabatic demagnetization used for refrigeration only at very low temperatures? \n\nThe reason is that the magnetic energy level splitting (the Zeeman splitting) is typically very small compared to the thermal energy kT except at low temperatures. At high temperatures many other degrees of freedom (for example, lattice vibrations) dominate the heat capacity and the spins do not store a significant fraction of the system’s entropy. Only when kT becomes comparable to or smaller than the Zeeman splitting can the spin degrees of freedom play an effective role in refrigeration. This is why adiabatic demagnetization is useful only at very low temperatures.\n\n2. What does it mean to have T < 0, and can this give a means of reaching T = 0?\n\nIn a system with an upper bound on energy (like the non-interacting spins which can be “fully populated” in the excited state), one can achieve a situation in which the population of the higher-energy state exceeds that of the lower-energy state. If one formally writes the Boltzmann factor as exp(–βE), such an “inverted population” corresponds to a negative β and hence a negative temperature T. However, a state at T < 0 is not “colder” than one at T = 0; in fact, because the Boltzmann distribution is inverted, T < 0 is actually “hotter” than any state with T > 0 (so that if a negative-temperature system is brought into thermal contact with a positive-temperature system, heat flows from the negative-temperature system to the positive-temperature one). Thus, negative temperatures are not a means to reach absolute zero (T = 0) but rather describe a peculiar, non-equilibrium state that is allowed only in systems with bounded energy. Absolute zero cannot be reached by any finite process, including adiabatic demagnetization.\n\nFinal Answer in Summary:\n\n • The entropy depends only on H/T: S = f(H/T).\n\n • In an adiabatic process, entropy is constant, so if H is lowered, T must lower proportionally.\n\n • Adiabatic demagnetization is effective only at very low T because only then is the Zeeman splitting comparable to kT and the magnetic degrees of freedom dominate the entropy.\n\n • Negative temperatures can occur in systems with an upper energy bound (via population inversion) but these states are “hotter” than any positive temperature and do not allow us to reach T = 0.\n\nThe final answer is thus:\n\n  \\[\\boxed{S = f(H/T),\\quad \\textrm{so that in an adiabatic (constant entropy) process a reduction in }H\\textrm{ forces }T\\textrm{ to drop proportionally; however, adiabatic demagnetization is only effective at very low temperatures (where the spin energy scale is comparable to }kT\\textrm{) and while systems with finite energy can have }T<0\\textrm{ (via population inversion), such negative temperatures do not represent states colder than }T=0.}\\]", "final_answers": ["S = f(H/T),\\quad \\textrm{so that in an adiabatic (constant entropy) process a reduction in }H\\textrm{ forces }T\\textrm{ to drop proportionally; however, adiabatic demagnetization is only effective at very low temperatures (where the spin energy scale is comparable to }kT\\textrm{) and while systems with finite energy can have }T<0\\textrm{ (via population inversion), such negative temperatures do not represent states colder than }T=0."], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "S = f(H/T),\\quad \\textrm{so that in an adiabatic (constant entropy) process a reduction in }H\\textrm{ forces }T\\textrm{ to drop proportionally; however, adiabatic demagnetization is only effective at very low temperatures (where the spin energy scale is comparable to }kT\\textrm{) and while systems with finite energy can have }T<0\\textrm{ (via population inversion), such negative temperatures do not represent states colder than }T=0.", "expr2": "S = f\\left(\\frac{H}{T}\\right)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "statistics/2-81", "solution": "We usually start with the “plain‐vanilla” Debye theory for an isotropic 3D solid, in which all the low–energy acoustic phonons have a linear dispersion (ω ≈ v|k|). (In this case the number of modes with frequency less than ω grows as ω³, and one finds at very low temperature that the specific heat C ∝ T³.) However, graphite is not isotropic. Its strongly bonded carbon layers are weakly coupled by van der Waals forces. One consequence is that one of the acoustic modes – the one corresponding to out‐of–plane (or “bending”) vibrations – does not have a linear dispersion. In fact, in an isolated 2D layer of carbon (as in graphene) the bending mode is “soft” and has a quadratic dispersion, ω ≈ α k², at long wavelengths.\n\nLet us explain step by step how this leads to C ∝ T:\n\nStep 1. Splitting the Phonon Modes\n\nIn graphite the in–plane (highly bonded) modes have a linear dispersion just as in the 3D Debye model. In contrast, the weak inter–layer (out–of–plane) coupling means that the corresponding acoustic vibration (which one may view as the “bending” mode) is nearly two–dimensional and displays a quadratic dispersion for small in–plane wave–vectors. (There may be a crossover to 3D behavior at higher energies, but at low T the quadratic behavior dominates.)\n\nStep 2. Density of States for a Quadratic Dispersion in 2D\n\nFor a general dispersion law in d dimensions one finds that the number of modes with frequency less than ω, N(ω), is obtained by counting the allowed k–states. For a 2D system with quadratic dispersion (ω ≈ α k²), solving for k gives k ≈ √(ω/α). Thus, the “volume” (area in 2D) in k–space with |k| ≤ √(ω/α) is proportional to (ω/α). Hence, the number of states (and, differentiating, the density of states) is\n\n  g(ω) ∝ dN/dω ∝ constant (i.e. independent of ω).\n\nStep 3. Low–Temperature Behavior of the Specific Heat\n\nNow, when g(ω) is roughly constant (say, g(ω) ≈ g₀ for low frequencies), the internal energy from such modes is given by\n\n  U ∝ ∫₀^∞ dω   g₀ (ħω) / (e^(βħω) − 1).\n\nMaking the change x = βħω, this yields\n\n  U ∝ g₀ (k_B T)² ∫₀^∞ dx   x/(e^x − 1).\n\nThat integral is finite, so one immediately obtains\n\n  U ∝ T²  ⇒  C = dU/dT ∝ T.\n\nStep 4. Conclusion\n\nThus, by adapting Debye theory to account for the anisotropic dispersion – namely, treating the out–of–plane bending mode as having a quadratic dispersion (with a constant density of states) – one naturally obtains a contribution to the phonon specific heat that is linear in temperature at low T. In graphite, this mode dominates the low–temperature specific heat, explaining why experimentally one finds C ∝ T.\n\nFinal Answer:\n  \\[ \\boxed{\\text{The weak interlayer coupling makes the out‐of–plane (bending) phonon acquire a quadratic dispersion (}\\omega \\propto k^2\\text{), so that, when treated within a two–dimensional Debye model, its density of states is constant and yields a specific heat } C\\propto T.} \\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{The weak interlayer coupling makes the out‐of–plane (bending) phonon acquire a quadratic dispersion (}\\omega \\propto k^2\\text{), so that, when treated within a two–dimensional Debye model, its density of states is constant and yields a specific heat } C\\propto T."], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{The weak interlayer coupling makes the out‐of–plane (bending) phonon acquire a quadratic dispersion (}\\omega \\propto k^2\\text{), so that, when treated within a two–dimensional Debye model, its density of states is constant and yields a specific heat } C\\propto T.", "expr2": "C_v = \\frac{3k_B^3 L^2 (c_{\\parallel}^{-2} + 2c_{\\perp}^{-2})}{\\pi \\hbar^2 }\\zeta(3) T^2"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "statistics/1-29", "solution": "We wish to compare the energy–momentum balance on two very different “planets”: a large one (the Earth) and a tiny one (a “chondrule” of radius 0.1 cm) when both are bathed in the radiation from an idealized “sun” (a black‐body of temperature Tₛ = 6000 K and radius Rₛ = 7×10¹⁰ cm) at a distance d = 1.5×10¹³ cm. (For simplicity, note that we are using cgs units throughout; you may convert to SI units if desired.) We assume that (i) the Earth absorbs all the radiation on its cross‐sectional (πR_E²) area, but reradiates uniformly over its full surface area (4πR_E²) so that its temperature is uniform, and (ii) the chondrule is a spherical, perfectly conducting blackbody. (In the latter case one must be a little careful because a small, rapidly–rotating sphere does not have a uniform temperature if the radiative timescale is short compared with the rotation period, but here we are concerned only with the order–of–magnitude forces.)\n\nLet us work through each part carefully.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Temperature of the Earth\n\nThe luminosity of the sun is\n\n  Lₛ = 4π Rₛ² σ Tₛ⁴,\n\nso that at distance d the radiant power per unit area (the “flux”) is\n\n  F = Lₛ/(4π d²) = σ Tₛ⁴ (Rₛ/d)².\n\nNow the Earth intercepts an energy rate\n\n  (P_in)_Earth = (π R_E²) F = π R_E² σTₛ⁴ (Rₛ/d)².\n\nBecause the Earth is assumed to have a very effective internal heat transport, its entire surface (area 4π R_E²) is at uniform temperature T_E and radiates\n\n  (P_out)_Earth = 4π R_E² σT_E⁴.\n\nBalance (P_in = P_out) gives\n\n  π R_E² σTₛ⁴ (Rₛ/d)² = 4π R_E² σT_E⁴.\n\nCanceling the common factors (πR_E²σ) we deduce\n\n  Tₛ⁴ (Rₛ/d)² = 4 T_E⁴   ⟹  T_E⁴ = (Rₛ²/(4 d²)) Tₛ⁴.\n\nTaking fourth roots we obtain\n\n  T_E = Tₛ (Rₛ²/(4 d²))^(1/4)\n     = Tₛ (Rₛ/(2d))^(1/2).\n\nNow plug in the numbers:\n  Rₛ = 7×10¹⁰ cm,  d = 1.5×10¹³ cm.\nThus,\n  Rₛ/(2d) = (7×10¹⁰)/(2×1.5×10¹³) = 7×10¹⁰/3×10¹³ ≈ 2.33×10^(–3).\nTaking the square root gives\n  √(2.33×10^(–3)) ≈ 0.0483.\nThen\n  T_E ≈ 6000 K × 0.0483 ≈ 290 K.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Radiation Force on the Earth\n\nThe radiation pressure for an electromagnetic flux F is (for a perfectly absorbing surface)\n  P_rad = F/c.\n\nSince the Earth intercepts the flux on its circular “shadow” area π R_E², the momentum per unit time (force) imparted is\n\n  F_rad = (π R_E²)(F/c).\n\nBut we already have\n\n  F = σTₛ⁴ (Rₛ/d)²,\nso\n\n  F_rad = (π R_E²/c) σTₛ⁴ (Rₛ/d)².\n\nLet’s collect the formula:\n  F_rad = π R_E² σTₛ⁴ (Rₛ/d)² / c.\n\nWe now plug in numerical values:\n  σ (the Stefan–Boltzmann constant in cgs) ≈ 5.67×10^(–5) erg/(cm²·s·K⁴),\n  Tₛ = 6000 K,\n  R_E = 6×10⁸ cm,\n  Rₛ = 7×10^(10) cm,\n  d = 1.5×10^(13) cm,\n  c = 3×10^(10) cm/s.\n\nProceed step by step:\n\n1.

Compute (Rₛ/d)²:\n  (Rₛ/d) = (7×10^(10))/(1.5×10^(13)) ≈ 4.667×10^(–3),\n  so (Rₛ/d)² ≈ (4.667×10^(–3))² ≈ 2.18×10^(–5).\n\n3. Compute πR_E²:\n  R_E² = (6×10⁸)² = 36×10^(16) = 3.6×10^(17),\n  thus πR_E² ≈ 3.14×3.6×10^(17) ≈ 1.13×10^(18) cm².\n\nNow assemble:\n  F_rad = [1.13×10^(18) cm² × 5.67×10^(–5) erg/(cm²·s·K⁴) × 1.296×10^(15) K⁴ × 2.18×10^(–5)] / (3×10^(10) cm/s).\n\nCalculate the numerator first:\n  1.13×10^(18) × 5.67×10^(–5) ≈ 6.42×10^(13).\nMultiply by 1.296×10^(15) gives\n  6.42×10^(13) × 1.296×10^(15) ≈ 8.32×10^(28).\nMultiply by 2.18×10^(–5) gives\n  8.32×10^(28) × 2.18×10^(–5) ≈ 1.81×10^(24) erg/s.\nNow divide by c = 3×10^(10) cm/s:\n  F_rad ≈ (1.81×10^(24))/(3×10^(10)) ≈ 6.03×10^(13) dynes.\n\nThus the Earth experiences a radiation force of roughly 6×10^(13) dynes.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Comparison with a Chondrule\n\nNow consider a small spherical “chondrule” of radius R = 0.1 cm. (We neglect here the complications of non–uniform temperature; assume for now that it is a black‐body which quickly comes to an “equilibrium” so that the flux balance is similar to before.)\n\n(i) Equilibrium Temperature:\nFor any sphere that absorbs isotropically the incoming solar radiation over its geometric cross–section πR² and re–emits over 4πR², the equilibrium temperature is given by the same energy–balance:\n  πR² σTₛ⁴ (Rₛ/d)² = 4πR² σT_eq⁴,\nwhich implies\n  T_eq⁴ = (Rₛ²/(4d²)) Tₛ⁴  ⟹  T_eq = Tₛ (Rₛ/(2d))^(1/2).\nThus, the chondrule’s equilibrium temperature is exactly the same as that of the Earth – about 290 K – provided that it rotates fast enough (or is small enough) to have a nearly uniform surface temperature. (In reality, if its temperature is non–uniform, its effective “recoil force” may (via the Yarkovsky effect) drive a non–radial acceleration.)\n\n(ii) Radiation Force:\nThe radiation force on the chondrule, again assuming it simply absorbs (or equivalently, re–emits isotropically) is\n  F_rad,chond = (πR²/c) σTₛ⁴ (Rₛ/d)².\nSince here R = 0.1 cm, compared with R_E = 6×10^(8) cm for the Earth, the ratio of the forces scales as (R/chond/R_E)². Thus, one may write\n  (F_rad,chond)/(F_rad,Earth) = (R/chond / R_E)²\n    = (0.1/(6×10^(8)))².\nA quick computation gives:\n  (0.1)² = 0.01 and (6×10^(8))² = 3.6×10^(17). Thus,\n  (F_rad,chond)/(F_rad,Earth) ≈ 0.01/3.6×10^(17) ≈ 2.78×10^(–20).\nSince we found F_rad,Earth ≈ 6×10^(13) dynes, the chondrule force is\n  F_rad,chond ≈ 6×10^(13) × 2.78×10^(–20) ≈ 1.67×10^(–6) dynes.\nThus, while the tiny chondrule is heated to nearly the same temperature as the Earth, the total momentum received by it from solar radiation is extremely small compared to that on the Earth.

(b) Adiabatic Reversible Expansion Final Temperature\n\nFor a reversible adiabatic (no heat exchange) process in an ideal gas, the temperature and volume are related by\n\n  T V^(γ–1) = constant,\n\nwhere γ (gamma) is the heat capacity ratio, γ = Cₚ/Cᵥ.\n\nFor many diatomic gases at room temperature, a common approximation is γ = 1.4 (if not otherwise specified). (Note: For a monatomic ideal gas, γ = 5/3, but since many common gases are diatomic at T ≃ 273.15 K, we will use γ = 1.4.)\n\nLet the initial state be (T_i, V_i) and the final state be (T_f, V_f).

However, it does appear in the partition function. Our goal is to derive the vibrational specific heat C_vib as a function of temperature.\n\nStep 1. Write the Vibrational Partition Function\n\nThe vibrational partition function is\n\n  Z_vib = Σₙ exp[–βEₙ] = Σₙ exp[–βℏω₀(n + ½)]\n      = exp(–βℏω₀/2) Σₙ exp(–βℏω₀ n).\n\nRecognizing the sum as a geometric series (with common ratio exp(–βℏω₀), which is less than 1 for positive temperature), we have\n\n  Σₙ exp(–βℏω₀ n) = 1 / [1 – exp(–βℏω₀)].\n\nThus,\n\n  Z_vib = exp(–βℏω₀/2) / [1 – exp(–βℏω₀)]\n      = exp(–θ/(2T)) / [1 – exp(–θ/T)],      (since β = 1/(kT)).\n\nStep 2. Calculate the Internal Energy\n\nThe internal energy U is given by\n\n  U = –∂/∂β ln Z_vib.\n\nFirst, compute ln Z_vib:\n  ln Z_vib = –(βℏω₀)/2 – ln[1 – exp(–βℏω₀)]\n       = –(θ/(2T)) – ln[1 – exp(–θ/T)].\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to β (or equivalently with respect to T) will give the full internal energy including the zero-point contribution. However, as mentioned, the zero-point energy (first term) is independent of T and does not contribute to the specific heat. Therefore, we focus on the temperature dependent part.\n\nA standard result (which you can derive by differentiating ln Z_vib with respect to β) shows that the mean vibrational energy is:\n\n  U = (½ℏω₀) + ℏω₀/(exp(ℏω₀/(kT)) – 1)\n    = (½ kθ) + kθ/(exp(θ/T) – 1).\n\nFor the specific heat C_vib, we differentiate U with respect to T. Since the zero-point contribution (½kθ) is constant, only the second term contributes:\n\n  U_vib(T) = kθ/(exp(θ/T) – 1).\n\nStep 3. Differentiate U_vib to Find C_vib\n\nThe vibrational specific heat is\n\n  C_vib = dU_vib/dT.\n\nLet x = θ/T so that U_vib = kθ/(eˣ – 1). Then\n\n  dU_vib/dT = d/dT [kθ/(e^(θ/T) – 1)].\n\nDifferentiate with respect to T using the chain rule. Notice that\n\n  d(e^(θ/T))/dT = –(θ/T²) e^(θ/T).\n\nThus,\n  dU_vib/dT = kθ · d/dT [1/(e^(θ/T) – 1)]\n        = – kθ · [e^(θ/T)/(e^(θ/T) – 1)²] · d/dT(e^(θ/T))\n        = – kθ · [e^(θ/T)/(e^(θ/T) – 1)²] · (–θ/T² e^(θ/T))\n        = kθ²/T² · [e^(θ/T) · e^(θ/T)]/(e^(θ/T) – 1)²\n        = k (θ/T)² · [e^(θ/T)]/(e^(θ/T) – 1)².\n\nThus, the vibrational specific heat is given by\n\n  C_vib = k (θ/T)² · [e^(θ/T)]/(e^(θ/T) – 1)².\n\nStep 4. High and Low Temperature Limits\n\na) High Temperature Limit (T >> θ):\n\nWhen T >> θ, the quantity x = θ/T is very small. Then we can expand the exponential in a Taylor series:\n\n  e^(θ/T) ≈ 1 + (θ/T) + ½ (θ/T)² + …\n\nThus, e^(θ/T) – 1 ≈ θ/T. Plugging into the expression for C_vib:\n\n  C_vib ≈ k (θ/T)² · [1 + (θ/T)]/(θ/T)² ≈ k.\n\nThis is the classical Dulong-Petit result for a one-dimensional (harmonic oscillator) degree of freedom, which contributes k to the specific heat (remember, a harmonic oscillator has two quadratic degrees of freedom – kinetic and potential – but here the vibrational partition function already accounts for both).\n\nb) Low Temperature Limit (T << θ):\n\nWhen T << θ, x = θ/T is very large. Then, e^(θ/T) >> 1, and\n\n  e^(θ/T) – 1 ≈ e^(θ/T).\n\nIn this limit,\n\n  C_vib ≈ k (θ/T)² · e^(θ/T)/(e^(θ/T))² = k (θ/T)² e^(–θ/T).\n\nThus, at low temperatures the vibrational contribution to the specific heat is exponentially suppressed, approaching zero as T → 0.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C_{\\text{vib}} = k \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{T}\\right)^2 \\frac{e^{\\theta/T}}{\\left(e^{\\theta/T} - 1\\right)^2}}\n\\]\n\nHigh Temperature Limit: For T >> θ, C_vib → k.\n\nLow Temperature Limit: For T << θ, C_vib ~ k (θ/T)² e^(–θ/T) → 0.", "final_answers": ["C_{\\text{vib}} = k \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{T}\\right)^2 \\frac{e^{\\theta/T}}{\\left(e^{\\theta/T} - 1\\right)^2}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "C_{\\text{vib}} = k \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{T}\\right)^2 \\frac{e^{\\theta/T}}{\\left(e^{\\theta/T} - 1\\right)^2}", "expr2": "C_v = R \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{T}\\right)^2 e^{\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{T}\\right)}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "C_{\\text{vib}} = k \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{T}\\right)^2 \\frac{e^{\\theta/T}}{\\left(e^{\\theta/T} - 1\\right)^2}", "expr2": "C_v \\approx R"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "C_{\\text{vib}} = k \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{T}\\right)^2 \\frac{e^{\\theta/T}}{\\left(e^{\\theta/T} - 1\\right)^2}", "expr2": "C_v \\approx R \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{T}\\right)^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\theta}{T}\\right)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

In our estimates we assume that air is an ideal diatomic gas (mainly N₂ and O₂) and that a “room” is a typical one (with a volume of several tens of cubic meters). In what follows we describe one way to “get the answer.”\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): Estimate the Number of Molecules in a Room\n\nA common “back‐of‐the‐envelope” method is to imagine a room of volume roughly 50 m³. (For example, a 5×5×2 m room has 50 m³ volume.)\n\nThe density of air is about\n  ρ ≈ 1.2 kg/m³.\nThen the total mass of air is\n  m ≈ (1.2 kg/m³)(50 m³) = 60 kg.\nAir is mostly diatomic with a molar mass M ≈ 29 g/mol = 0.029 kg/mol. Thus, the number of moles is\n  n ≈ 60 kg / 0.029 kg/mol ≈ 2069 mol.\nSince one mole contains Avogadro’s number NA ≈ 6.02×10²³ molecules, the total number of molecules is\n  N ≈ 2069 mol × 6.02×10²³ molecules/mol ≈ 1.25×10²⁷ molecules.\nThus, (a) we have roughly 10²⁷ molecules in a typical room.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Estimate Their Energy, Per Mole\n\n“Energy” here is taken to mean the thermal (internal) energy contained in an ideal gas. For a monatomic ideal gas the translational kinetic energy per mole would be (3/2)RT. However, for diatomic molecules (with no vibrational excitation at room temperature) there are 3 translational and 2 rotational degrees of freedom so that the internal energy is\n  U = (5/2)RT  (per mole).\nTaking room temperature T ≈ 293 K and R = 8.314 J/(mol·K) we have\n\n  U ≈ (5/2)(8.314 J/(mol·K))(293 K)\n     ≈ 5/2 × 2437 J/mol \n     ≈ 6093 J/mol.\nThus, (b) the energy per mole is roughly 6×10³ joules (or 6×10¹⁰ ergs per mole, since 1 J = 10⁷ ergs).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Heat Needed to Warm One Mole of Air from 0°C to 20°C\n\nAt constant pressure the heat needed to raise the temperature of one mole of an ideal gas (with constant‐pressure molar heat capacity Cp) is given by\n  Q = n·Cp·ΔT  with n = 1.\nFor a diatomic gas, the molar heat capacity at constant pressure is\n  Cp = (7/2)R,\nso that numerically\n  Cp ≈ (7/2)(8.314 J/(mol·K)) ≈ 29.1 J/(mol·K).\nThe temperature change is ΔT = 20°C (remembering the change is the same in Kelvin), so\n  Q ≈ (29.1 J/(mol·K))×20 K ≈ 582 J.\nThus, (c) about 600 J of heat must be added to warm one mole of air from 0°C to 20°C.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (d): Minimum Energy Required by a Refrigerator\n\nNow we wish to “cool” one mole of air at 1 atm from 20°C to 18°C. That is, we want to remove a small amount of heat from the air. In a cyclic (reversible) refrigerator the minimum work required is not the same as the thermal energy removed; the ratio is given by the Carnot coefficient of performance (COP). For a refrigerator operating between a “cold” reservoir at temperature TL (the temperature at which heat is removed) and a “hot” reservoir at temperature TH (the temperature at which the heat is rejected) the Carnot COP is\n\n  COP = TL/(TH – TL).\nIn our problem, the refrigerator “rejects” heat at 40°C, i.e. TH = 313 K. Since the cooling is taking the air from 20°C to 18°C, the heat is removed over a small range. (One may think of it as being removed at nearly 20°C; for a more careful treatment one could integrate over temperature. Here we take an effective TL of about 292 K—the average between 293 K and 291 K.)\nThus, approximately,\n  COP ≈ 292 K/(313 K – 292 K) = 292/21 ≈ 13.9.\nThe cooling load is the amount of heat removed in cooling one mole from 20°C to 18°C.

{"id": "statistics/1-18", "solution": "We start with 10 L of an ideal gas at 1 atm. The gas is first compressed isothermally (constant temperature) to 1 L and then allowed to expand adiabatically (no heat exchange) back to 10 L. Although the cycle does not return to the same thermodynamic state (the temperature is lower at the end), we may still “sketch” the two processes on a pV diagram and compare the work exchanges for a monatomic versus a diatomic gas.\n\nLet’s analyze step‐by‐step.\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nStep 1. Isothermal Compression\n\nFor an ideal gas at constant temperature, the equation pV = const holds. The initial state is (V₁ = 10 L, p₁ = 1 atm) so that pV = 10 (L·atm). Compressing isothermally to V₂ = 1 L means that\n  p₂ = 10 atm.\nThus on a pV diagram the isothermal compression is a hyperbola connecting (10, 1 atm) to (1, 10 atm).\n\nThe work done (from the gas–perspective) in an isothermal process is\n\n  W_iso = –nRT ln(V₂/V₁).\n\n(Here the negative sign means that when the gas is compressed, work is done on it.)\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nStep 2. Adiabatic Expansion\n\nDuring an adiabatic process the relation\n\n  pV^γ = constant\n\nholds. However, the value of γ (the heat capacity ratio) depends on the gas:\n• For a monatomic gas, γ = 5/3 ≈ 1.67.\n• For a diatomic gas (with vibrational modes “frozen out”), γ ≈ 7/5 = 1.4.\n\nAt the beginning of the adiabatic expansion, the state is (V₂ = 1 L, p₂ = 10 atm). When the gas expands adiabatically to V₃ = 10 L, the final pressures are determined by\n\n  p₃ = p₂ (V₂/V₃)^γ.\nSo, for the two cases:\n– Monatomic:\n  p₃,mono = 10 atm × (1/10)^(5/3) = 10/10^(1.67) ≈ 10/46.4 ≈ 0.22 atm.\n– Diatomic:\n  p₃,di = 10 atm × (1/10)^(1.4) = 10/10^(1.4) ≈ 10/25.1 ≈ 0.40 atm.\n\nThus, on the same pV diagram the adiabatic expansion “curve” leaves the point (1, 10 atm) and reaches (10, 0.22 atm) for the monatomic gas and (10, 0.40 atm) for the diatomic gas.\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n(a) and (b) Graphical sketches on a pV diagram\n\nFor both gases the diagram shows:\n1. An isothermal compression curve – a hyperbola from (10, 1 atm) to (1, 10 atm).\n2. An adiabatic expansion curve:\n – For the monatomic gas, a curve with the equation pV^(5/3) = constant connecting (1, 10 atm) to roughly (10, 0.22 atm). This curve falls more steeply.\n – For the diatomic gas, the adiabatic curve is given by pV^(1.4) = constant connecting (1, 10 atm) to roughly (10, 0.40 atm); it is not as steep as that for a monatomic gas.\n\nA quick sketch would show these two curves on the same pV plot:\n• The horizontal “volume” axis runs from 0 to a bit more than 10 L.\n• The “pressure” axis starts near 0 and extends up to about 10 atm.\n• For both cases, the isothermal compression is the same; only the adiabatic expansion curve differs.\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n(c) Net Work Done\n\nNow, regarding the net work done in this two‐step process:\n\n1. In the isothermal compression from 10 L → 1 L, work is done on the system. (The gas does negative work; the surroundings do positive work on the gas.)\n\n2. In the adiabatic expansion from 1 L → 10 L, the gas does work (it expands and produces work on the surroundings).\n\nHowever, if we compute the magnitudes (using the ideal gas relations), we find that the work done by the gas during the adiabatic expansion does not “recover” all the work that was required during the isothermal compression. One may, for a rough analysis, note that the isothermal work magnitude is\n\n  |W_iso| = nRT ln(10).\n\nIn the adiabatic expansion the work done by the gas (which equals the decrease in its internal energy, ΔU) depends on the heat capacity. For example, for a monatomic gas (with internal energy U = (3/2)nRT) the work in the adiabatic expansion comes out to be approximately\n\n  W_ad,mono = (3/2)nRT [1 – 1/10^(2/3)].\n\nA numerical estimate shows that for a monatomic gas the work output during expansion is less than nRT ln(10). Thus the overall net work (work done by the gas minus work done on it) is negative. That is, net work is done on the system.\n\nTherefore, answer to (c): The net work is done on the system.\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n(d) Comparison: Diatomic vs. Monatomic\n\nFor the diatomic gas the effective degrees of freedom are higher (with U = (5/2)nRT for a diatomic molecule at room temperature, ignoring vibrations), which makes the change in internal energy during the adiabatic expansion larger for the same change in temperature. In fact, one finds that the work done by the gas during the adiabatic expansion is\n  W_ad,di = (5/2)nRT [1 – 1/10^(0.4)],\nwhich turns out to be smaller in magnitude than the work done during the isothermal compression.\n\nA short numerical comparison yields:\n• For the monatomic gas, the net result is roughly –1.13 nRT.\n• For the diatomic gas, the net result is roughly –0.80 nRT.\n(The negative sign means that overall work is done on the gas – i.e. the surroundings supply net work.)\n\nThus, less net work is done on the diatomic gas than on the monatomic gas. (In other words, the diatomic gas returns more of the “compression work” during its expansion, so the “loss” is smaller.)\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) For a monatomic gas the pV diagram shows an isothermal hyperbola from (10 L, 1 atm) to (1 L, 10 atm) followed by an adiabatic curve given by pV^(5/3) = constant from (1, 10 atm) to approximately (10 L, 0.22 atm).\n\n(b) For a diatomic gas the isothermal curve is the same but the adiabatic expansion (pV^(1.4) = constant) goes from (1, 10 atm) to about (10 L, 0.40 atm).\n\n(c) The net work is negative (i.e. net work is done on the system).\n\n(d) In magnitude, the net work done on the diatomic gas is less than that done on the monatomic gas.\n\nFinally, our answer in boxed LaTeX is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) For a monatomic gas: An isothermal compression from (10\\,L, 1\\,atm) to (1\\,L, 10\\,atm) (pV = \\text{constant}),} \\\\\n\\quad\\text{followed by an adiabatic expansion (pV}^{5/3} = \\text{ constant) from (1\\,L, 10\\,atm) to approximately (10\\,L, 0.22\\,atm).} \\\\\n\\text{(b) For a diatomic gas: The isothermal compression is identical, but the adiabatic expansion, obeying} \\\\\n\\quad\\text{pV}^{1.4} = \\text{ constant, goes from (1\\,L, 10\\,atm) to about (10\\,L, 0.40\\,atm).} \\\\\n\\text{(c) Overall, the net work is done on the system (the work done on compressing exceeds that recovered in expansion).} \\\\\n\\text{(d) The net work (in absolute value) is less for a diatomic gas than for a monatomic one.}\n\\end{array} } \\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) For a monatomic gas: An isothermal compression from (10\\,L, 1\\,atm) to (1\\,L, 10\\,atm) (pV = \\text{constant}),} \\\\\n\\quad\\text{followed by an adiabatic expansion (pV}^{5/3} = \\text{ constant) from (1\\,L, 10\\,atm) to approximately (10\\,L, 0.22\\,atm).} \\\\\n\\text{(b) For a diatomic gas: The isothermal compression is identical, but the adiabatic expansion, obeying} \\\\\n\\quad\\text{pV}^{1.4} = \\text{ constant, goes from (1\\,L, 10\\,atm) to about (10\\,L, 0.40\\,atm).} \\\\\n\\text{(c) Overall, the net work is done on the system (the work done on compressing exceeds that recovered in expansion).} \\\\\n\\text{(d) The net work (in absolute value) is less for a diatomic gas than for a monatomic one.}\n\\end{array}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) For a monatomic gas: An isothermal compression from (10\\,L, 1\\,atm) to (1\\,L, 10\\,atm) (pV = \\text{constant}),} \\\\\n\\quad\\text{followed by an adiabatic expansion (pV}^{5/3} = \\text{ constant) from (1\\,L, 10\\,atm) to approximately (10\\,L, 0.22\\,atm).} \\\\\n\\text{(b) For a diatomic gas: The isothermal compression is identical, but the adiabatic expansion, obeying} \\\\\n\\quad\\text{pV}^{1.4} = \\text{ constant, goes from (1\\,L, 10\\,atm) to about (10\\,L, 0.40\\,atm).} \\\\\n\\text{(c) Overall, the net work is done on the system (the work done on compressing exceeds that recovered in expansion).} \\\\\n\\text{(d) The net work (in absolute value) is less for a diatomic gas than for a monatomic one.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "\\text{Net work is done on the system.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) For a monatomic gas: An isothermal compression from (10\\,L, 1\\,atm) to (1\\,L, 10\\,atm) (pV = \\text{constant}),} \\\\\n\\quad\\text{followed by an adiabatic expansion (pV}^{5/3} = \\text{ constant) from (1\\,L, 10\\,atm) to approximately (10\\,L, 0.22\\,atm).} \\\\\n\\text{(b) For a diatomic gas: The isothermal compression is identical, but the adiabatic expansion, obeying} \\\\\n\\quad\\text{pV}^{1.4} = \\text{ constant, goes from (1\\,L, 10\\,atm) to about (10\\,L, 0.40\\,atm).} \\\\\n\\text{(c) Overall, the net work is done on the system (the work done on compressing exceeds that recovered in expansion).} \\\\\n\\text{(d) The net work (in absolute value) is less for a diatomic gas than for a monatomic one.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "\\text{The work on the monatomic gas is greater than that on the diatomic gas.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "statistics/1-80", "solution": "We will show that by combining thermodynamics with the (dynamical) measurement of the rubber’s “spring–constant” we can predict the isothermal (static) stretch of the band when a small extra weight is added. (In what follows “rubber” and “elastic band” are used interchangeably.)\n\nBelow is an outline of the reasoning.\n\n───────────────────────────── Step 1. Thermodynamics of the Rubber Elasticity\n\nFor many rubber bands the dominant part of the “tension” is not an energetic effect but an entropic one. (In more‐traditional “Hooke’s law” springs the energy depends on the spring deformation; in rubber the internal energy is almost independent of length, and the force comes almost entirely from the change in entropy.) In a first–approximation one may write the free energy as\n\n  F(L, T)= U(L) – T S(L).\n\nOften one assumes U(L) ≈ constant so that \n  f ≡ ∂F/∂L = –T (dS/dL).\n\nThus the force is “entropic” – increasing with temperature and proportional to –(dS/dL). (A detailed microscopic calculation shows that indeed dS/dL is negative so that the tension f is positive.) \n\n───────────────────────────── Step 2. The Adiabatic Stretch (Measurement (a))\n\nWhen the band is stretched very rapidly the process is nearly adiabatic (i.e. no heat is exchanged, so S stays constant). In any adiabatic process we have\n\n  dS = (∂S/∂L)_T dL + (∂S/∂T)_L dT =0.\n\nSolve for dT/dL:\n  dT/dL = - (∂S/∂L)_T/(∂S/∂T)_L.\n\nBut the denominator is just the heat capacity at constant L (apart from a factor T), because\n  (∂S/∂T)_L = C_L/T.\nAlso, we already have\n  (dS/dL)_T = – f/T.\nThus\n  dT/dL = – (– f/T) / (C_L/T) = f/C_L.\nThat is, during a rapid (adiabatic) stretch a small increase dL produces a temperature change\n  dT = (f/C_L)dL         (1)\n\nIn an experiment one measures the temperature change ΔT when the band is stretched by a small amount ΔL adiabatically. Equation (1) then shows that the “instantaneous” tension in the band is given by\n\n  f = C (ΔT/ΔL).         (2)\n\nHere C is the appropriate heat capacity (we drop the subscript L).\n\n───────────────────────────── Step 3. Small Oscillations (Measurement (b))\n\nNow, in a separate experiment the band is held with one end fixed and a known weight W is attached to the other, and the frequency of small oscillations is measured (the assumption is that the oscillations are fast and nearly adiabatic). In a harmonic approximation the motion is described by\n\n  m (d²(δL)/dt²) = – k_ad δL,\nwith the solution having frequency\n  ν = (1/2π) √(k_ad/m),\nso that we may define the “adiabatic spring constant”\n\n  k_ad = (2πν)² m.         (3)\n\n───────────────────────────── Step 4. Relating the “Isothermal” and the “Adiabatic” Spring‐constants\n\nThe static measurement (measurement (c)) is made slowly so that heat can be exchanged; thus it is an isothermal measurement. In thermodynamics the “spring–constant” when temperature is held constant (the curvature of the free–energy) is\n\n  k_iso = (∂²F/∂L²)_T.\nIn contrast, the measured small oscillation constant is “adiabatic”:\n  k_ad = (∂²U/∂L²)_S.\nOne may show by a standard thermodynamic argument (analogous to the relation between isothermal and adiabatic compressibilities) that\n\n  k_ad = k_iso + (T/C)(∂f/∂T)_L².     (4)\n\nNow, recall that we have\n  f = – T (dS/dL).\nThus at fixed L,\n  (∂f/∂T)_L = – (dS/dL) = f/T,     (since f = –T (dS/dL) ).\nThen (4) becomes\n\n  k_ad = k_iso + (T/C)(f/T)² = k_iso + f²/(C T).     (5)\n\nWe already determined in (2) that the tension in the adiabatic experiment is\n\n  f = C (ΔT/ΔL).\nThus, (5) may be written as\n\n  k_iso = k_ad – f²/(C T)\n      = (2πν)²m – (C/T) (ΔT/ΔL)².     (6)\n\nThis k_iso is exactly the effective spring–constant that governs the isothermal (static) response.\n\n───────────────────────────── Step 5. Prediction for the Static Stretch (Measurement (c))\n\nWhen a small additional force (or weight) Q is applied slowly (so that the process is isothermal), the resulting additional extension δL is given by Hooke’s law\n\n  Q = k_iso δL     or  δL = Q/k_iso.\nThen, using (6) for k_iso we obtain\n\n  δL = Q / [ (2πν)² m – (C/T) (ΔT/ΔL)² ].     (7)\n\nThis is the required relation: it expresses the size of the isothermal length–change under a small added weight in terms of the measured adiabatic temperature change per unit length (measurement (a)) and the measured frequency (measurement (b)).\n\n───────────────────────────── Final Answer\n\nThus one acceptable final answer is\n\n  δL = Q / { (2πν)² m – (C/T)[(ΔT)/(ΔL)]² }.\n\nWe note that in this formula:\n • ΔT and ΔL are measured in the rapid (adiabatic) stretching (experiment (a)),\n • ν (and m = W/g, with the weight W used in the oscillation experiment) comes from experiment (b),\n • and Q is the additional force (weight) added in experiment (c).\n\nWe box the answer in Latex format:\n\n  \\[\n\\boxed{\\delta L = \\frac{Q}{(2\\pi \\nu)^2\\, m - \\dfrac{C}{T}\\left(\\dfrac{\\Delta T}{\\Delta L}\\right)^2}\\,.}\n\\]\n\nThis is the prediction: given the adiabatic temperature change per unit stretch and the oscillation frequency, one can “predict” the static (isothermal) extension δL when an extra force Q is applied.", "final_answers": ["\\delta L = \\frac{Q}{(2\\pi \\nu)^2\\, m - \\dfrac{C}{T}\\left(\\dfrac{\\Delta T}{\\Delta L}\\right)^2}\\,."], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\delta L = \\frac{Q}{(2\\pi \\nu)^2\\, m - \\dfrac{C}{T}\\left(\\dfrac{\\Delta T}{\\Delta L}\\right)^2}\\,.", "expr2": "\\delta L = \\left( \\frac{dL_0}{dT} - \\frac{W}{\\left(\\frac{4\\pi^2 W}{g} \\nu^2\\right)^2} \\frac{d}{dT} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi^2 W}{g} \\nu^2\\right) \\right) \\frac{\\delta Q}{C_W}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "L**2*Q/(-C*T + 4*L**2*m*nu**2*pi**2)", "expr2": "0"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Now we analyze each part step by step.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 1: Entropy Change of the Resistor (a)\n\nEven though the resistor transforms electrical energy into heat (Joule heating), because it is in contact with a thermal reservoir that keeps its temperature constant, any entropy generated internally is immediately dumped into the reservoir.

That is, at the critical point we have\n   (∂p/∂V)_T = 0   and  (∂²p/∂V²)_T = 0.\nA standard analysis of Eq. (2) gives\n\n  V_c = 3b,\n  T_c = 8a/(27Rb),\n  p_c = a/(27b²).\n\nOn a p–V diagram (with V horizontal and p vertical) one draws curves corresponding to T > T_c, T = T_c, and T < T_c. The T < T_c curves show an unphysical S–shaped region. The point (V_c, p_c, T_c) is the critical point.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Evaluating the Dimensionless Ratio pV/RT at the Critical Point\n\nWe wish to compute\n\n  (pV/RT)_{critical} = (p_c V_c)/(R T_c).\n\nUsing the critical values found above:\n • p_c = a/(27b²),\n • V_c = 3b,\n • T_c = 8a/(27Rb).\n\nFirst, compute p_c V_c:\n  p_c V_c = [a/(27b²)] (3b) = 3a/(27b) = a/(9b).\n\nAlso, RT_c = R[8a/(27Rb)] = 8a/(27b).\n\nNow, the ratio is\n\n  (p_c V_c)/(R T_c) = (a/(9b)) / (8a/(27b))\n           = (a/(9b)) × (27b/(8a))\n           = (27)/(9×8) = 27/72 = 3/8.\n\nThus, at the critical point, the dimensionless ratio is 3/8.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Maxwell’s Construction and the Modified Isotherm\n\nFor T < T_c the S–shaped Van der Waals isotherm (from Eq. (2)) has regions in which (∂p/∂V)_T > 0. Such behavior is unphysical because it would correspond to a negative compressibility. In a real substance, during a phase change (liquid and vapor coexist), the pressure remains constant as the volume changes. Maxwell’s idea was to replace the S–shaped part of the isotherm by a horizontal line (constant pressure p₀) which connects the two volumes where the gas and liquid phases coexist.\n\nMaxwell required that the “area of the loop” above the horizontal line be exactly equal to the area of the “dip” below it. Mathematically, if V₁ and V₂ are the endpoints (volumes) of the horizontal section, then one must have\n\n  ∫₍V₁₎^(V₂) [p(V) – p₀] dV = 0.\n\nThis construction guarantees that the Gibbs free energy (which is found by an integral of the pressure with respect to volume) is the same for both phases, ensuring phase equilibrium. In a diagram one would show the original van der Waals curve, then replace the unstable portion by a horizontal line at p₀; the areas above and below this line between V₁ and V₂ (as determined by the van der Waals curve) are equal.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (d): Showing that C_V Is a Function of Temperature Alone\n\nFor any substance the internal energy U may in general depend on both temperature T and volume V, i.e., U = U(T,V). However, for a Van der Waals gas the “nonideal” corrections are assumed not to contribute to the dependence of U on temperature. In other words, the temperature dependence comes solely from the kinetic (ideal gas) part of the energy. A thermodynamic relation (derived from the fundamental thermodynamic identity) is\n\n  (∂U/∂V)_T = T (∂p/∂T)_V – p.    (3)\n\nFor the van der Waals gas,\n  p = [RT/(V – b)] – a/V².\nThen\n\n  (∂p/∂T)_V = R/(V – b).\n\nSo,\n  (∂U/∂V)_T = T[R/(V – b)] – [RT/(V – b) – a/V²]\n           = (TR/(V – b)) – (RT/(V – b)) + a/V²\n           = a/V².\n\nThus the change of internal energy with volume at fixed T is given solely by a term a/V², which comes from the intermolecular attraction. Importantly, when we calculate the heat capacity at constant volume\n\n  C_V = (∂U/∂T)_V,\nany explicit V–dependence from the potential energy term does not occur because the a/V term in U does not depend on T. In other words, the temperature derivative (∂U/∂T)_V is the same as that of an ideal gas. Therefore, for a Van der Waals gas, C_V is a function of T only and is independent of V.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n (a) The Van der Waals isotherms in the p–V plane show an S–shape for T < T_c, with the critical point given by V_c = 3b, T_c = 8a/(27Rb), and p_c = a/(27b²).  \n (b) At the critical point, p_cV_c/(RT_c) = 3/8.  \n (c) Maxwell’s construction replaces the unphysical portion of the isotherm by a horizontal line (at pressure p₀) determined by requiring equal areas above and below the line between the coexistence volumes; this ensures equal Gibbs free energies for the two phases.  \n (d) Since for a Van der Waals gas the only T–dependent part of the internal energy is the same as that for an ideal gas, the constant–volume heat capacity, C_V = (∂U/∂T)_V, depends only on T and not on V.\n\n Thus, the final answers are\n\n  \\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & V_c=3b,\\quad T_c=\\frac{8a}{27Rb},\\quad p_c=\\frac{a}{27b^2};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\frac{p_cV_c}{RT_c}=\\frac{3}{8};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\text{Maxwell's construction replaces the unstable S–shaped portion with a horizontal tie–line at } p_0 \n\\\\[2mm]\n& \\quad \\text{such that } \\int_{V_1}^{V_2}(p(V)-p_0)\\,dV=0\\text{, thereby ensuring equal Gibbs free energies.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad & C_V=\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_V\\text{ is independent of }V \\text{ (as for an ideal gas).}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & V_c=3b,\\quad T_c=\\frac{8a}{27Rb},\\quad p_c=\\frac{a}{27b^2};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\frac{p_cV_c}{RT_c}=\\frac{3}{8};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\text{Maxwell's construction replaces the unstable S–shaped portion with a horizontal tie–line at } p_0 \n\\\\[2mm]\n& \\quad \\text{such that } \\int_{V_1}^{V_2}(p(V)-p_0)\\,dV=0\\text{, thereby ensuring equal Gibbs free energies.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad & C_V=\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_V\\text{ is independent of }V \\text{ (as for an ideal gas).}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & V_c=3b,\\quad T_c=\\frac{8a}{27Rb},\\quad p_c=\\frac{a}{27b^2};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\frac{p_cV_c}{RT_c}=\\frac{3}{8};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\text{Maxwell's construction replaces the unstable S–shaped portion with a horizontal tie–line at } p_0 \n\\\\[2mm]\n& \\quad \\text{such that } \\int_{V_1}^{V_2}(p(V)-p_0)\\,dV=0\\text{, thereby ensuring equal Gibbs free energies.}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad & C_V=\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_V\\text{ is independent of }V \\text{ (as for an ideal gas).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "V_c = 3b, \\; p_c = \\frac{a}{27b^2}, \\; T_c = \\frac{8a}{27bR}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

However, for the ideal gas the electromagnetic (or intermolecular potential) interactions are absent so that U depends only on temperature.

Condition \n  (∂S/∂V)_p < 0.\n\nAt first sight one might expect that, at fixed pressure, increasing volume increases the number of accessible configurations and hence the entropy. (Indeed, for the ideal gas one finds, using the equation of state, that S increases with V at fixed p.) Thus, for “normal” substances one normally has (∂S/∂V)_p > 0. In order for the derivative to be negative one must have a substance whose response is “anomalous” – so that when the system is forced to expand at constant p it must “order” rather than disorder. (One finds that upon expansion the temperature must drop so much that the loss in thermal disorder outweighs the extra positional disorder.) An example of such anomalous behavior occurs in water. (See, for example, the discussion of density anomalies in water.) When water is near its temperature of maximum density (near 4°C at 1 atm) a volume increase (at fixed pressure) is accompanied by a reorganization of the hydrogen–bond network that leads to a net decrease in the entropy. (One may say that the system “orders” more as its local structure becomes more tetrahedral.) Thus a possible answer is: a liquid (such as water under conditions near its density maximum) for which the anomalous thermal – expansion properties lead to (∂S/∂V)_p < 0.\n\n─────────────────────────────\n\nStep (c). Condition \n  (∂T/∂S)_p = 0.\n\nIn words, at constant pressure an increase in the entropy does not change the temperature. This is precisely what happens during a first–order phase transition (at fixed pressure) when latent heat is absorbed (or released) at a constant temperature. (For instance, as ice melts or water boils at 1 atm the temperature stays fixed while the entropy changes discontinuously.) Thus one acceptable answer is: a system undergoing a first–order phase transition (say, boiling water at 1 atm) exhibits (∂T/∂S)_p = 0 during the coexistence interval.\n\n─────────────────────────────\n\nStep (d). Condition \n  (∂S/∂V)_T = 0.\n\nThere is a useful Maxwell relation,\n  (∂S/∂V)_T = (∂p/∂T)_V.\nThus the condition (∂S/∂V)_T = 0 is equivalent to (∂p/∂T)_V = 0. In words, at fixed volume the pressure is independent of temperature. This is not a property of, say, an ideal gas (for which p ∝ T), but it is the characteristic of a system whose “configurational” (or potential‐energy) part does not “feel” the temperature. One may think of a system in which the only T–dependent contribution to the entropy is “decoupled” from the volume. (For instance, many nearly “incompressible” solids have vibrational densities of state that change only very weakly with volume. In a crude approximate description the entropy at fixed temperature may then be nearly independent of V.) Thus an acceptable answer is: a nearly incompressible solid (or any system with an “athermal” equation of state so that (∂p/∂T)_V ≈ 0) will have (∂S/∂V)_T = 0.\n\n─────────────────────────────\n\nStep (e). Condition \n  (∂T/∂V)_S = - (∂p/∂S)_V.\n\nOne may show (by taking the appropriate second derivatives of U(S,V)) that the equality\n  (∂T/∂V)_S = - (∂p/∂S)_V\nis in fact an automatic consequence of the fundamental thermodynamic relation. In other words, it is nothing other than a Maxwell relation that holds for any system (in which U is a state function of S and V). Thus an acceptable answer is: every classical, single–component, fixed–mass chemical system (with a well–defined U(S,V)) satisfies this relation.\n\n─────────────────────────────\n\nThus, one acceptable complete answer is as follows:\n\n(a) An ideal gas (for which the internal energy is a function only of T) satisfies (∂U/∂V)_T = 0.\n\n(b) A liquid with anomalous thermal–expansion – for example, water near the temperature of its density maximum – will have (∂S/∂V)_p < 0 (since expansion at fixed p then “orders” the system).\n\n(c) A system undergoing a first–order phase transition (e.g. boiling water at 1 atm, or melting ice) has (∂T/∂S)_p = 0, since T remains constant while heat is absorbed (latent heat).\n\n(d) A nearly incompressible solid (or any system with an “athermal”

{"id": "statistics/2-122", "solution": "We consider two particles that may occupy any of the single‐particle energy levels\n\n  εn = nε  n = 0, 1, 2,\n\nwith the lowest level (n = 0, energy 0) being doubly degenerate. (For clarity we label the two “0‐levels” as 0a and 0b.) In what follows we will list explicitly all the allowed micro–configurations (complete many–particle states) and then sum their Boltzmann weights exp(–βE) to obtain the relevant partition functions. (Once the partition function is known the thermal average energy is given by\n  ⟨E⟩ = [ΣiEi e^(–βEi)] / Z,\nand an explicit list of energies and their multiplicities is enough to write this sum.) We now discuss each case.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): (1) Fermions\n\nFermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, so no two particles can occupy the same single–particle state. Since our available single–particle states are labeled as 0a, 0b, 1, and 2 (with energies 0, 0, ε, and 2ε respectively) the allowed two–particle configurations are obtained by choosing two different states (order does not matter because the particles are identical).\n\nList of allowed configurations:\n1. (0a, 0b): Total energy E = 0 + 0 = 0.\n2. (0a, 1):  Total energy E = 0 + ε = ε.\n3. (0b, 1):  Total energy E = 0 + ε = ε.\n4. (0a, 2):  Total energy E = 0 + 2ε = 2ε.\n5. (0b, 2):  Total energy E = 0 + 2ε = 2ε.\n6. (1, 2):  Total energy E = ε + 2ε = 3ε.\n\nThus the six Fermi micro–states have energies 0 (multiplicity 1), ε (multiplicity 2), 2ε (multiplicity 2), and 3ε (multiplicity 1). The Fermi partition function is therefore\n\n  Z_F = 1 · e^(–β·0) + 2 · e^(–β ε) + 2 · e^(–β (2ε)) + 1 · e^(–β (3ε))\n      = 1 + 2e^(–βε) + 2e^(–2βε) + e^(–3βε).\n\nOnce Z_F is known the mean energy is given by\n  ⟨E⟩_F = [0·1 + ε·(2e^(–βε)) + 2ε·(2e^(–2βε)) + 3ε·(e^(–3βε))] / Z_F.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): (2) Bosons\n\nBosons have no exclusion rule; indeed, more than one boson may occupy the same single–particle state. However, since they are indistinguishable the many–particle states must be symmetrized and the counting done appropriately. In our case a convenient procedure is to list all “occupation–number” configurations for the four distinct single–particle states: 0a, 0b, 1, and 2. (When two bosons occupy the same state we count that configuration only once.)\n\nLet’s enumerate them by grouping according to the total energy:\n\n(A) Both particles in (n = 0) states:\n  (i) Both in 0a  : energy = 0.\n  (ii) Both in 0b  : energy = 0.\n  (iii) One in 0a and one in 0b : energy = 0.\n  → Total: 3 configurations at energy 0.\n\n(B) One particle in an (n = 0) state and one in state 1 (energy = ε):\n  (iv) (0a, 1)\n  (v) (0b, 1)\n  → Total: 2 configurations at energy ε.\n\n(C) One particle in an (n = 0) state and one in state 2 (energy = 2ε):\n  (vi) (0a, 2)\n  (vii) (0b, 2)\n  → Total: 2 configurations at energy 2ε.\n\n(D) Both in state 1:\n  (viii) (1,1)  : energy = ε + ε = 2ε.\n  → 1 configuration at energy 2ε.\n\n(E) One in state 1 and the other in state 2:\n  (ix) (1,2)  : energy = ε + 2ε = 3ε.\n  → 1 configuration at energy 3ε.\n\n(F) Both in state 2:\n  (x) (2,2)  : energy = 2ε + 2ε = 4ε.\n  → 1 configuration at energy 4ε.\n\nA total check: 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10 configurations (which is indeed the number of ways to put 2 bosons in 4 states using “stars–and–bars”: (4+2–1 choose 2) = (5 choose 2) = 10).\n\nThus the boson partition function is\n\n  Z_B = 3·e^(–β·0) + 2·e^(–βε) + [2 + 1]·e^(–2βε) + 1·e^(–3βε) + 1·e^(–4βε)\n      = 3 + 2e^(–βε) + 3e^(–2βε) + e^(–3βε) + e^(–4βε).\n\nAnd the average bosonic energy is computed in analogy with the Fermi case.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): (3) Distinguishable (Boltzmann) Particles\n\nFor distinguishable particles (say, labeled A and B), every assignment of each particle to one of the four available single–particle states must be counted separately. Thus particle A has 4 choices (0a, 0b, 1, 2) and particle B also has 4 choices, giving a total of 16 configurations. (There is no “symmetrization” here.) An efficient way is to write the single–particle partition function as\n\n  z₁ = [degeneracy(0)]·e^(–β·0) + e^(–βε) + e^(–2βε) = 2 + e^(–βε) + e^(–2βε).\n\nSince the particles are independent the total partition function is simply\n\n  Z_MB = (z₁)² = [2 + e^(–βε) + e^(–2βε)]².\n\nFor completeness, one may also enumerate the 16 configurations as follows.\n- Both particles in (n = 0) states:\n  Possibilities: (0a,0a), (0a,0b), (0b,0a), (0b,0b) → 4 states; energy 0.\n- One particle in an n = 0 state and the other in state 1:\n  Possibilities: (0a,1), (0b,1), (1,0a), (1,0b) → 4 states; energy = ε.\n- One particle in an n = 0 state and the other in state 2:\n  Possibilities: (0a,2), (0b,2), (2,0a), (2,0b) → 4 states; energy = 2ε.\n- Both in state 1:\n  (1,1) → 1 state; energy = 2ε.\n- One in state 1 and one in state 2:\n  (1,2) and (2,1) → 2 states; energy = 3ε.\n- Both in state 2:\n  (2,2) → 1 state; energy = 4ε.\nA quick count gives 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 16, as required.\n\nThe Boltzmann partition function is thus\n\n  Z_MB = 4 + 4e^(–βε) + [4 + 1]e^(–2βε) + 2e^(–3βε) + e^(–4βε)\n      = 4 + 4e^(–βε) + 5e^(–2βε) + 2e^(–3βε) + e^(–4βε),\nwhich indeed is the expansion of [2 + e^(–βε) + e^(–2βε)]².\n\nThe mean energy is given by\n\n  ⟨E⟩_MB = { [0·4] + [ε·4e^(–βε)] + [2ε·5e^(–2βε)] + [3ε·2e^(–3βε)] + [4ε·e^(–4βε)] } / Z_MB.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): When Can Fermions or Bosons Be Treated as Boltzmann Particles?\n\nIn many circumstances quantum statistical effects (exchange symmetry) may be neglected and one may use the simpler Maxwell–Boltzmann (MB) statistics. This “classical limit” occurs under conditions where the average occupancy of each quantum state is very small. More precisely:\n\n • A necessary condition is that the thermal de Broglie wavelength λ_th be much smaller than the mean inter–particle spacing. Equivalently, one demands that the fugacity z = exp(βμ) is very much less than unity (z ≪ 1), so that the quantum concentration nλ_th^d (with d the spatial dimension) is very low.\n • In physical terms, a high temperature and/or low density are required so that the probability of two or more particles “meeting” (and thus requiring symmetrization or antisymmetrization of the wave function) is negligible.\n\nUnder these conditions the differences between Fermi–Dirac, Bose–Einstein, and Boltzmann statistics become insignificant and either kind of particle may be modeled accurately by MB statistics.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThus, for our system we have:\n\n1. Fermions:\n  • The allowed configurations are:\n   (0a,0b): E = 0;\n   (0a,1) and (0b,1): E = ε;\n   (0a,2) and (0b,2): E = 2ε;\n   (1,2):  E = 3ε.\n  • The partition function is\n   Z_F = 1 + 2e^(–βε) + 2e^(–2βε) + e^(–3βε).\n\n2. Bosons:\n  • The allowed configurations are:\n   – Both in n = 0:\n    (i) 0a–0a, (ii) 0a–0b, (iii) 0b–0b   (energy 0, 3 states);\n   – One in n = 0 and one in n = 1:\n    (iv) (0a,1), (v) (0b,1)   (energy ε, 2 states);\n   – One in n = 0 and one in n = 2:\n    (vi) (0a,2), (vii) (0b,2)  (energy 2ε, 2 states);\n   – Both in state 1:\n    (viii) (1,1)   (energy 2ε, 1 state);\n   – One in state 1 and one in state 2:\n    (ix) (1,2)   (energy 3ε, 1 state);\n   – Both in state 2:\n    (x) (2,2)   (energy 4ε, 1 state).\n  • The partition function is\n   Z_B = 3 + 2e^(–βε) + 3e^(–2βε) + e^(–3βε) + e^(–4βε).\n\n3. Distinguishable Boltzmann particles:\n  • Each particle independently has the single–particle partition function\n   z₁ = 2 + e^(–βε) + e^(–2βε),\n  so that\n   Z_MB = z₁² = (2 + e^(–βε) + e^(–2βε))².\n  • (Alternatively, one may enumerate the 16 configurations with appropriate degeneracies:\n   energy 0: 4 states, energy ε: 4 states, energy 2ε: 5 states, energy 3ε: 2 states, energy 4ε: 1 state.)\n\nFinally, Fermions or Bosons can be treated as Boltzmann particles when the system is in the non–degenerate limit (i.e. when the density is low and the thermal de Broglie wavelength is much smaller than the inter–particle spacing, or equivalently when the fugacity z ≪ 1). Under these conditions the probability that two particles occupy the same quantum state is negligible, and the quantum (exchange) effects can be ignored.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Summary\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(1) Fermions:}&\\quad Z_F = 1 + 2e^{-\\beta\\varepsilon} + 2e^{-2\\beta\\varepsilon} + e^{-3\\beta\\varepsilon},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(2) Bosons:}&\\quad Z_B = 3 + 2e^{-\\beta\\varepsilon} + 3e^{-2\\beta\\varepsilon} + e^{-3\\beta\\varepsilon} + e^{-4\\beta\\varepsilon},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(3) Distinguishable (Boltzmann) particles:}&\\quad Z_{MB} = \\Bigl(2+e^{-\\beta\\varepsilon}+e^{-2\\beta\\varepsilon}\\Bigr)^2;\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{Also, }&\\text{Fermions/Bosons reduce to Boltzmann statistics when } z\\ll 1\\, \\text{ (i.e. at low density/high temperature).}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(1) Fermions:}&\\quad Z_F = 1 + 2e^{-\\beta\\varepsilon} + 2e^{-2\\beta\\varepsilon} + e^{-3\\beta\\varepsilon},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(2) Bosons:}&\\quad Z_B = 3 + 2e^{-\\beta\\varepsilon} + 3e^{-2\\beta\\varepsilon} + e^{-3\\beta\\varepsilon} + e^{-4\\beta\\varepsilon},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(3) Distinguishable (Boltzmann) particles:}&\\quad Z_{MB} = \\Bigl(2+e^{-\\beta\\varepsilon}+e^{-2\\beta\\varepsilon}\\Bigr)^2;\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{Also, }&\\text{Fermions/Bosons reduce to Boltzmann statistics when } z\\ll 1\\, \\text{ (i.e. at low density/high temperature).}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(1) Fermions:}&\\quad Z_F = 1 + 2e^{-\\beta\\varepsilon} + 2e^{-2\\beta\\varepsilon} + e^{-3\\beta\\varepsilon},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(2) Bosons:}&\\quad Z_B = 3 + 2e^{-\\beta\\varepsilon} + 3e^{-2\\beta\\varepsilon} + e^{-3\\beta\\varepsilon} + e^{-4\\beta\\varepsilon},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(3) Distinguishable (Boltzmann) particles:}&\\quad Z_{MB} = \\Bigl(2+e^{-\\beta\\varepsilon}+e^{-2\\beta\\varepsilon}\\Bigr)^2;\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{Also, }&\\text{Fermions/Bosons reduce to Boltzmann statistics when } z\\ll 1\\, \\text{ (i.e. at low density/high temperature).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "z = 1 + 2e^{-\\beta \\varepsilon} + e^{-3\\beta \\varepsilon}(1 + 2e^{\\beta \\varepsilon})"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(1) Fermions:}&\\quad Z_F = 1 + 2e^{-\\beta\\varepsilon} + 2e^{-2\\beta\\varepsilon} + e^{-3\\beta\\varepsilon},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(2) Bosons:}&\\quad Z_B = 3 + 2e^{-\\beta\\varepsilon} + 3e^{-2\\beta\\varepsilon} + e^{-3\\beta\\varepsilon} + e^{-4\\beta\\varepsilon},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(3) Distinguishable (Boltzmann) particles:}&\\quad Z_{MB} = \\Bigl(2+e^{-\\beta\\varepsilon}+e^{-2\\beta\\varepsilon}\\Bigr)^2;\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{Also, }&\\text{Fermions/Bosons reduce to Boltzmann statistics when } z\\ll 1\\, \\text{ (i.e. at low density/high temperature).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "E = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{z}e^{-\\beta\\varepsilon} (2 + 4e^{-\\beta\\varepsilon} + 3e^{-2\\beta\\varepsilon})"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(1) Fermions:}&\\quad Z_F = 1 + 2e^{-\\beta\\varepsilon} + 2e^{-2\\beta\\varepsilon} + e^{-3\\beta\\varepsilon},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(2) Bosons:}&\\quad Z_B = 3 + 2e^{-\\beta\\varepsilon} + 3e^{-2\\beta\\varepsilon} + e^{-3\\beta\\varepsilon} + e^{-4\\beta\\varepsilon},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(3) Distinguishable (Boltzmann) particles:}&\\quad Z_{MB} = \\Bigl(2+e^{-\\beta\\varepsilon}+e^{-2\\beta\\varepsilon}\\Bigr)^2;\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{Also, }&\\text{Fermions/Bosons reduce to Boltzmann statistics when } z\\ll 1\\, \\text{ (i.e. at low density/high temperature).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "z = 3 + 2e^{-\\beta \\epsilon} + 3e^{-2\\beta \\epsilon} + e^{-3\\beta \\epsilon} + e^{-4\\beta \\epsilon}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Showing ΔS_total is Always Positive\n\nTo show that ΔS_total > 0 for either sign of (T_f − T_i)/T_f, it is convenient to introduce a small parameter x defined by\n\n  x = (T_f − T_i)/T_f.\n\nThus, T_i = T_f (1 − x) and\n\n  T_f/T_i = 1/(1 − x).\n\nSubstituting into the total entropy change gives\n\n  ΔS_total = Cₚ [ ln(1/(1 − x)) − x ] = Cₚ [ − ln(1 − x) − x ].\n\nNow, assuming that |x| < 1 (which is equivalent to |T_f − T_i|/T_f < 1), we can expand the logarithm in a Taylor series:\n\n  ln(1 − x) = − x − x²/2 − x³/3 − ⋯  (for |x| < 1).\n\nThus,\n\n  − ln(1 − x) = x + x²/2 + x³/3 + ⋯.\n\nSubstitute this series back into the expression for ΔS_total:\n\n  ΔS_total = Cₚ [ (x + x²/2 + x³/3 + ⋯) − x ] = Cₚ [ x²/2 + x³/3 + ⋯].\n\nSince all the terms in the series (x²/2, x³/3, …) are positive (regardless of whether x is positive or negative, note that x² is always positive, and for small x the dominant term is x²/2), we have\n\n  ΔS_total > 0  for x ≠ 0.\n\nThus, whether T_f > T_i (x > 0) or T_f < T_i (x < 0), the total change in entropy of the universe is positive, in agreement with the Second Law of Thermodynamics.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n  The total entropy change is\n\n  ΔS_total = Cₚ [ ln(T_f/T_i) − (T_f − T_i)/T_f ],\n\nand it is always positive for either sign of (T_f − T_i)/T_f provided |(T_f − T_i)|/T_f < 1.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Delta S_{\\text{total}} = C_p \\left[\\ln\\frac{T_f}{T_i} - \\frac{T_f - T_i}{T_f}\\right] > 0}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\Delta S_{\\text{total}} = C_p \\left[\\ln\\frac{T_f}{T_i} - \\frac{T_f - T_i}{T_f}\\right] > 0"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\Delta S_{\\text{total}} = C_p \\left[\\ln\\frac{T_f}{T_i} - \\frac{T_f - T_i}{T_f}\\right] > 0", "expr2": "\\Delta S = C_p \\left( \\frac{T_i}{T_f} - 1 + \\ln \\frac{T_f}{T_i} \\right) > 0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "statistics/1-115", "solution": "We will show below, step by step, how one may arrive at the stated results by considering an appropriate reversible Carnot cycle and the thermodynamics of surfaces.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 1. (a) Vapor‐pressure and the Clapeyron Equation\n\nSuppose we have a liquid (or a solid) in equilibrium with its vapor at pressure p. In a reversible cycle one may “simulate” the phase change by imagining the following Carnot‐like cycle:\n\n1. At the higher temperature (T + dT) the system absorbs an amount Q (which, for the phase change, may be taken as the latent heat l per mole) while the vapor expands doing external work.\n2. At T the system gives up work (–W) and rejects heat so that, after the cycle is completed, the net change is zero in the cyclic state variables.\n\nFor a Carnot cycle the net work output dW (the work “gained” when going from T + dT to T) is related to the absorbed heat by  \n  dW/dT = Q/T.\n\nNow, regarding the phase change we note the following:\n• The vapor is assumed to be an ideal gas so that 1 mole obeys pV = RT.\n• A molar transformation from liquid (or solid) to vapor requires heat l.\n• Moreover, if one imagines the vapor undergoing an expansion so as to “do work” equal to p dV (with dV determined by the ideal gas law), then one may relate the variation of the pressure with temperature.\n\nA more common route is to use the Clapeyron equation:\n  dp/dT = (l p)/(R T^2)\nbecause the molar volume of the liquid (or solid) is negligible compared to that of the vapor. Dividing by p we have\n  (1/p) dp/dT = l/(R T^2)\nor equivalently,\n  d ln p/dT = l/(R T^2).\n\nThus, we have shown that\n\n  d ln p/dT = l/(R T^2).\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 2. (b) Surface Energy, Surface Tension and the “Surface Gibbs–Duhem”\n\nFor a liquid film or surface the free energy is usually written as\n  F^s = τ A,\nwhere A is the area, and the temperature derivative of τ yields the surface entropy. More precisely, one may write\n  S^s = – (dτ/dT) A.\nNow, the internal energy U^s is given by the Legendre transform\n  U^s = F^s + T S^s = τA + T (–A dτ/dT) = A (τ – T dτ/dT).\nThus, on a per‐area basis we define the energy density\n  u = U^s/A = τ – T (dτ/dT).\n\nThis proves (b)(i).\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 3. (b)(ii) Adiabatic Increase in Surface Area\n\nNow suppose that the surface area is increased adiabatically (i.e. with no heat exchange) so that the total surface entropy S^s remains constant. Since\n  S^s = –A (dτ/dT),\nan infinitesimal change is given by\n  dS^s = –A (d^2τ/dT^2) dT – (dτ/dT) dA.\nSetting dS^s = 0 (adiabatic condition) gives \n  –A (d^2τ/dT^2) dT – (dτ/dT) dA = 0.\nHence, solving for dT we have\n  dT = –(dτ/dT) dA / [A (d^2τ/dT^2)].\nNow, notice that if dτ/dT < 0 (which is typical because the surface tension usually decreases with increasing temperature) then –(dτ/dT) > 0. Also, if d^2τ/dT^2 > 0 then the denominator is positive. Consequently, when the area A is increased (dA > 0), we obtain\n  dT > 0.\nThat is, for an adiabatic increase in area the temperature must increase in order to keep the surface entropy constant.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The vapor pressure satisfies\n\n  d ln p/dT = l/(R T^2).\n\n(b) (i) The surface energy per unit area is found to be\n\n  u = τ – T (dτ/dT).\n\n  (ii) If dτ/dT < 0 and d²τ/dT² > 0 then an adiabatic increase in area causes the temperature T to increase.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\frac{d\\ln p}{dT}=\\frac{l}{RT^2},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)(i)}\\quad &u=\\tau-T\\,\\frac{d\\tau}{dT},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)(ii)}\\quad &\\text{For an adiabatic increase in area, } T \\text{ increases.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\frac{d\\ln p}{dT}=\\frac{l}{RT^2},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)(i)}\\quad &u=\\tau-T\\,\\frac{d\\tau}{dT},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)(ii)}\\quad &\\text{For an adiabatic increase in area, } T \\text{ increases.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\frac{d\\ln p}{dT}=\\frac{l}{RT^2},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)(i)}\\quad &u=\\tau-T\\,\\frac{d\\tau}{dT},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)(ii)}\\quad &\\text{For an adiabatic increase in area, } T \\text{ increases.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{d \\ln p}{dT} = \\frac{l}{RT^2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

The coefficient of performance (COP) for an ideal heat pump lifting heat from a reservoir at Tₗ (low temperature) to a reservoir at Tₕ (high temperature) is\n\n  COP = Tₕ/(Tₕ – Tₗ)\n\nThe house must be heated to 30°C (303 K) and in this problem the low‐temperature reservoir is at 0°C (273 K).

{"id": "statistics/2-65", "solution": "We wish to study a gas of N spinless Bose particles (mass m) in a volume V at temperature T. In what follows k (or k_B) will denote Boltzmann’s constant and ℏ Planck’s constant divided by 2π.\n\nBelow we describe each part in detail.\n\n────────────────────────────\nPart (a): Density of Single‐Particle States\n\nFor a free particle in three dimensions the single‐particle energy is\n  ε = p²/(2m).\nThe number of states with momentum magnitude less than p is proportional to the volume of a sphere in momentum space. Taking into account that each single‐particle quantum state occupies a volume (2πℏ)³ in momentum space, one obtains\n  g(p)dp = (V/(2πℏ)³) 4π p²dp.\nChanging variables from p to energy using dp = (m/p)dε (since p = (2mε)^(1/2)) we arrive at\n  D(ε)dε = g(p) dp = (V/(2πℏ)³) 4π p² (m/p) dε.\nThat is,\n  D(ε) = (V/(2πℏ)³) 4π m p\nBut with p = √(2mε) we get\n  D(ε) = (V/(2πℏ)³)4π m [√(2mε)]\n       = V ⋅ (4π m (2m)^(1/2))/( (2πℏ)³) ⋅ ε^(1/2).\n\nIt is customary to rearrange the prefactors. One standard answer is\n  D(ε) = (V/(4π²)) (2m/ℏ²)^(3/2) √ε.\n\nThus, the number of single‐particle states per energy unit is proportional to √ε. (A sketch would show a curve starting at zero (for ε = 0) and growing like √ε.)\n\n────────────────────────────\nPart (b): Mean Occupation Number\n\nFor a Bose gas the average occupation number for a single–particle state of energy ε is given by the Bose–Einstein distribution:\n  n̄(ε) = 1⁄(exp[(ε – μ)/(kT)] – 1).\n\nAt a moderately high temperature – that is, above the Bose–Einstein condensation transition – the chemical potential μ is negative. In a plot of n̄(ε) versus ε one sees that n̄(ε) is a monotonically decreasing function. (Note: when ε → μ⁺ the occupation number diverges; however, for T above T_c since μ<0 the divergence occurs at a value ε < 0 which is not allowed. Hence the physically relevant part of the graph is for ε ≥ 0. On the ε–axis, the line ε = μ lies to the left of 0.) One would mark the vertical line at ε = μ (even though μ is negative) to indicate the energy scale.\n\n────────────────────────────\nPart (c): Integral Expression for μ(T) and Its T–Dependence\n\nThe total number of particles in the gas is given by summing (integrating) over all the single–particle states:\n  N = ∫₀^∞ dε D(ε) n̄(ε)\n    = ∫₀^∞ dε D(ε) [1/(exp((ε – μ)/(kT)) – 1)].\nThis integral implicitly determines μ(T).\n\nReferring to the sketch in part (a), note that as T is lowered (but while remaining above the condensation temperature) more particles tend to populate the low–energy states. In order to keep N fixed the chemical potential must “rise” (i.e. become less negative) as T decreases. In the limit T → T_c (from above) one finds μ(T) → 0 from below.\n\n────────────────────────────\nPart (d): Bose–Einstein Transition Temperature T_c\n\nAt the onset of Bose–Einstein condensation (T = T_c) all the particles may be accommodated in the “excited” states. (For T > T_c there is no macroscopic occupation of any single state.) Hence, at T = T_c one has \n  N = ∫₀^∞ dε D(ε)/(e^(ε/(kT_c)) – 1).\n\nUsing the expression from part (a),\n  N = (V/(4π²)) (2m/ℏ²)^(3/2) ∫₀^∞ dε [√ε/(e^(ε/(kT_c)) – 1)].\nChange variables via x = ε/(kT_c) so that dε = kT_c dx and √ε = √(kT_c) √x. Then one obtains\n  N = (V/(4π²)) (2m/ℏ²)^(3/2)(kT_c)^(3/2)∫₀^∞ dx x^(1/2)/(e^x – 1).\n\nDefining the dimensionless integral\n  I_{1/2} = ∫₀∞ dx x^(1/2)/(e^x – 1),\n(which can be written in terms of the Gamma function and Riemann zeta function as I_{1/2} = Γ(3/2) ζ(3/2) = (√π/2) ζ(3/2)), we have\n  N = (V/(4π²)) (2m/ℏ²)^(3/2)(kT_c)^(3/2) I_{1/2}.\n\nThus, solving for T_c yields\n  T_c = (1/k) { [4π²N / V] / [(2m/ℏ²)^(3/2) I_{1/2}] }^(2/3).\nEquivalently, one often finds\n  T_c = (2πℏ²/(mk)) [N/(V ζ(3/2))]^(2/3),\nsince I_{1/2} = (√π/2) ζ(3/2).\n\n────────────────────────────\nPart (e): Behavior for T < T_c\n\nBelow the Bose–Einstein transition temperature T_c, a macroscopic number of particles accumulates into the single–particle ground state. In this regime the chemical potential “saturates” at\n  μ(T) = 0 for T < T_c.\nThe excited–state occupation is still given by\n  n̄(ε) = 1/(e^(ε/(kT)) – 1)  for ε > 0,\nwhile the ground state (ε = 0) contains a condensate with occupation\n  N₀ = N – N_ex,\nwhere\n  N_ex = ∫₀∞ dε D(ε)/(e^(ε/(kT)) – 1).\nThus, below T_c nearly all the change in N comes from the ground state.\n\n────────────────────────────\nPart (f): Total Energy U(T,V) for T < T_c\n\nFor T < T_c the chemical potential is μ = 0, and the total energy is dominated by the excited states (the condensate at ε = 0 does not contribute to the energy). The energy is given by\n  U = ∫₀∞ dε D(ε) [ε/(e^(ε/(kT)) – 1)].\nAgain using the substitution x = ε/(kT), so that ε = kT x, dε = kT dx, and √ε = √(kT)√x, one obtains from part (a) (with D(ε) = (V/(4π²))(2m/ℏ²)^(3/2)√ε)\n  U = (V/(4π²))(2m/ℏ²)^(3/2) ∫₀∞ (kT x) (√(kT)x^(1/2))/(e^x – 1) kT dx.\nCollecting the factors we find\n  U = (V/(4π²))(2m/ℏ²)^(3/2)(kT)^(5/2) ∫₀∞ dx x^(3/2)/(e^x – 1).\n\nDefining the dimensionless integral\n  I_{3/2} = ∫₀∞ dx x^(3/2)/(e^x – 1)\n(which, in standard form, is I_{3/2} = Γ(5/2) ζ(5/2) = (3√π/4) ζ(5/2)), we obtain the final result:\n  U(T,V) = (V/(4π²))(2m/ℏ²)^(3/2)(kT)^(5/2) I_{3/2}.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\nWe now summarize our results:\n\n(a) The density of single–particle states is\n  D(ε) = (V/(4π²)) (2m/ℏ²)^(3/2) √ε.\n\n(b) The mean occupation number is\n  n̄(ε) = 1/(exp[(ε – μ)/(kT)] – 1).\nOn a plot of n̄ versus ε, for T > T_c (with μ < 0) the curve is monotonically decreasing, and the place ε = μ (which is negative) is indicated on the ε–axis.\n\n(c) The chemical potential is determined implicitly by\n  N = ∫₀∞ dε (V/(4π²)) (2m/ℏ²)^(3/2) √ε/(exp[(ε – μ)/(kT)] – 1).\nAs T is lowered, μ increases (i.e. becomes less negative) and approaches 0 from below.\n\n(d) The Bose–Einstein transition temperature T_c is defined by\n  N = (V/(4π²))(2m/ℏ²)^(3/2)(kT_c)^(3/2) I_{1/2},\nwith \n  I_{1/2} = ∫₀∞ dx x^(1/2)/(e^x – 1) = (√π/2) ζ(3/2).\nThus one may write\n  T_c = (2πℏ²/(mk)) [N/(V ζ(3/2))]^(2/3).\n\n(e) For T < T_c the chemical potential remains pinned at μ = 0. The excited–state occupation is then\n  n̄(ε) = 1/(e^(ε/(kT)) – 1) (for ε > 0),\nand there is a macroscopic condensate in the ground state (ε = 0) with\n  N₀ = N – ∫₀∞ dε D(ε)/(e^(ε/(kT)) – 1).\n\n(f) For T < T_c the total energy is given exactly by\n  U(T,V) = (V/(4π²)) (2m/ℏ²)^(3/2)(kT)^(5/2) I_{3/2},\nwith \n  I_{3/2} = ∫₀∞ dx x^(3/2)/(e^x – 1) = Γ(5/2) ζ(5/2) = (3√π/4) ζ(5/2).\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & D(\\varepsilon)=\\frac{V}{4\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}\\sqrt{\\varepsilon},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\bar{n}(\\varepsilon)=\\frac{1}{\\exp\\bigl[(\\varepsilon-\\mu)/(kT)\\bigr]-1},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & N=\\int_0^\\infty d\\varepsilon\\,\\frac{V}{4\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}\\frac{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}}{\\exp\\bigl[(\\varepsilon-\\mu)/(kT)\\bigr]-1},\\quad\\text{with }\\mu(T)\\nearrow 0\\text{ as }T\\downarrow T_c,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad & T_c \\text{ is given by } N=\\frac{V}{4\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}(kT_c)^{3/2}\\,I_{1/2},\\quad I_{1/2}=\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^{1/2}}{e^x-1}\\,dx,\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad\\text{so that } T_c=\\frac{2\\pi\\hbar^2}{mk}\\left[\\frac{N}{V\\,\\zeta(3/2)}\\right]^{2/3},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(e)}\\quad & \\mu(T)=0\\quad\\text{for } T<T_c,\\quad \\bar{n}(\\varepsilon)=\\frac{1}{e^{\\varepsilon/(kT)}-1}\\quad(\\varepsilon>0),\\quad N_0=N-\\int_0^\\infty d\\varepsilon\\;D(\\varepsilon)\\,\\bar{n}(\\varepsilon),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(f)}\\quad & U(T,V)=\\frac{V}{4\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}(kT)^{5/2}\\,I_{3/2},\\quad I_{3/2}=\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{x^{3/2}}{e^x-1}\\,dx.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & D(\\varepsilon)=\\frac{V}{4\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}\\sqrt{\\varepsilon},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\bar{n}(\\varepsilon)=\\frac{1}{\\exp\\bigl[(\\varepsilon-\\mu)/(kT)\\bigr]-1},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & N=\\int_0^\\infty d\\varepsilon\\,\\frac{V}{4\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}\\frac{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}}{\\exp\\bigl[(\\varepsilon-\\mu)/(kT)\\bigr]-1},\\quad\\text{with }\\mu(T)\\nearrow 0\\text{ as }T\\downarrow T_c,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad & T_c \\text{ is given by } N=\\frac{V}{4\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}(kT_c)^{3/2}\\,I_{1/2},\\quad I_{1/2}=\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^{1/2}}{e^x-1}\\,dx,\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad\\text{so that } T_c=\\frac{2\\pi\\hbar^2}{mk}\\left[\\frac{N}{V\\,\\zeta(3/2)}\\right]^{2/3},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(e)}\\quad & \\mu(T)=0\\quad\\text{for } T<T_c,\\quad \\bar{n}(\\varepsilon)=\\frac{1}{e^{\\varepsilon/(kT)}-1}\\quad(\\varepsilon>0),\\quad N_0=N-\\int_0^\\infty d\\varepsilon\\;D(\\varepsilon)\\,\\bar{n}(\\varepsilon),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(f)}\\quad & U(T,V)=\\frac{V}{4\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}(kT)^{5/2}\\,I_{3/2},\\quad I_{3/2}=\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{x^{3/2}}{e^x-1}\\,dx.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & D(\\varepsilon)=\\frac{V}{4\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}\\sqrt{\\varepsilon},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\bar{n}(\\varepsilon)=\\frac{1}{\\exp\\bigl[(\\varepsilon-\\mu)/(kT)\\bigr]-1},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & N=\\int_0^\\infty d\\varepsilon\\,\\frac{V}{4\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}\\frac{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}}{\\exp\\bigl[(\\varepsilon-\\mu)/(kT)\\bigr]-1},\\quad\\text{with }\\mu(T)\\nearrow 0\\text{ as }T\\downarrow T_c,\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad & T_c \\text{ is given by } N=\\frac{V}{4\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}(kT_c)^{3/2}\\,I_{1/2},\\quad I_{1/2}=\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^{1/2}}{e^x-1}\\,dx,\\\\[1mm]\n& \\quad\\text{so that } T_c=\\frac{2\\pi\\hbar^2}{mk}\\left[\\frac{N}{V\\,\\zeta(3/2)}\\right]^{2/3},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(e)}\\quad & \\mu(T)=0\\quad\\text{for } T<T_c,\\quad \\bar{n}(\\varepsilon)=\\frac{1}{e^{\\varepsilon/(kT)}-1}\\quad(\\varepsilon>0),\\quad N_0=N-\\int_0^\\infty d\\varepsilon\\;D(\\varepsilon)\\,\\bar{n}(\\varepsilon),\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(f)}\\quad & U(T,V)=\\frac{V}{4\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}(kT)^{5/2}\\,I_{3/2},\\quad I_{3/2}=\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{x^{3/2}}{e^x-1}\\,dx.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "D(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{2 \\pi V}{h^3} (2m)^{3/2} \\varepsilon^{1/2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "statistics/1-89", "solution": "We wish to compute the equilibrium magnetization when the free‐energy per spin at fixed magnetization is given in two different cases. In what follows we describe, step‐by‐step, how one obtains the answer.\n\n────────────────────────────── Step 1. The Equilibrium Condition\n\nWhen an external magnetic field B is applied the appropriate potential is the “field–free energy”\n  G(M) = F(M) – B M.\nThe equilibrium magnetization is the value of M which minimizes G(M). (One may also view B as the Lagrange multiplier corresponding to the constraint on the net magnetization.) In equilibrium we have\n  (d/dM)[F(M) – B M] = 0,\nor, if F(M) is smooth, \n  (dF/dM) = B.\n(We shall treat here the situation when F(M) is given in a piecewise form; we then have to minimize G by comparing the minima in the different regions.)\n\n────────────────────────────── Part (1): Piecewise F(M)\n\nThe given free–energy per spin is\n\n  F(M) = λ {  0      if |M/μ| ≤ 1/2,\n         (|M/μ| − 1/2)²  if 1 ≥ |M/μ| ≥ 1/2, }\n  with constant λ and single–spin magnetic moment μ. (Here M lies in the interval –μ ≤ M ≤ μ.)\n\nLet us define \n  x = M/μ,\nso that the allowed range is –1 ≤ x ≤ 1.\n\nThen the free–energy written in terms of x is\n  F(x) = λ {  0        if |x| ≤ 1/2,\n        (|x| − 1/2)²  if 1/2 ≤ |x| ≤ 1 }.\nIn the presence of the field the “total” free energy per spin is\n  G(x) = F(x) – B (μ x).\n\nA very important point is that F(x) is completely flat (F = 0) for |x| ≤ 1/2. In other words there is a “plateau” of states all with equal F (per spin). However, once we add the −B μ x term the degeneracy is lifted.\n\nBecause the free energy is an even function of x while the magnetic coupling is odd in x, the minimization will be “selection by the field” as follows:\n\n────────────────────────────── Case A. |x| ≤ 1/2 (the Plateau)\n\nFor |x| ≤ 1/2 we have\n  G_plateau = – B μ x.\nThus:\n• If B > 0, G_plateau is a decreasing function of x (the more x the lower the free energy). Thus on the plateau the minimum is reached at the maximum allowed value, x = +1/2.\n• Similarly, if B < 0 the minimum is reached at x = – 1/2.\n• At B = 0 the free energy is independent of x in the plateau. (An infinitesimal field will then “choose” one edge of the plateau.)\n\nThus for a positive but “small” field – when the optimum is within the plateau – one would have\n  x_eq = 1/2  ⇒ M_eq = μ/2,\nand for B negative,\n  x_eq = –1/2.\n\n────────────────────────────── Case B. |x| ≥ 1/2\n\nNow consider the region where the free energy is given by the quadratic expression. For definiteness let us consider B > 0 and x ≥ 1/2. Here\n  G(x) = λ (x – 1/2)² – B μ x.\nSince the function is smooth in this region we can minimize by setting the derivative to zero:\n  dG/dx = 2λ (x – 1/2) – B μ = 0.\nSolving for x gives\n  x – 1/2 = (B μ)/(2λ),\nor\n  x = 1/2 + (B μ)/(2λ).\n\nHowever, we must check that the solution lies in the region for which the expression was assumed, i.e. x ≥ 1/2 and x ≤ 1. Clearly x ≥ 1/2 is automatic for B > 0. The condition x ≤ 1 requires\n  1/2 + (B μ)/(2λ) ≤ 1  ⟹  (B μ)/(2λ) ≤ 1/2  ⟹  B μ ≤ λ.\n\nThus for B > 0 we have two regimes:\n\n1. If 0 < B < (λ/μ) then the minimization in the quadratic region leads to\n  x_eq = 1/2 + (B μ)/(2λ),\nso that\n  M_eq = μ x_eq = μ/2 + (μ² B)/(2λ).\n\n2. If B is so large that (B μ)>λ then the minimizer of G(x) in the quadratic branch would yield x > 1. But since x cannot exceed 1 (i.e. M ≤ μ) the only possibility is that the minimum is attained at the endpoint x = 1. In that case,\n  G(1) = λ (1 − 1/2)² – B μ = λ (1/4) – B μ.\nFor B > λ/μ, one finds this endpoint is lower than any state in the interior.\n\nA completely analogous discussion holds for B < 0 (by symmetry, the sign of x is reversed).\n\n────────────────────────────── Summary for (1)\n\nThus, the magnetization as a function of B may be summarized as follows:\n\nFor B > 0:\n • If 0 ≤ B < (λ/μ), then\n  M(B) = μ [1/2 + (B μ)/(2λ)].\n • If B ≥ (λ/μ), then\n  M(B) = μ.\nFor B < 0:\n • If –(λ/μ) < B ≤ 0, then\n  M(B) = –μ [1/2 + (|B| μ)/(2λ)]  (i.e. M(B) = –μ [1/2 – (B μ)/(2λ)]).\n • If B ≤ –(λ/μ), then\n  M(B) = –μ.\nAnd note: at B = 0 the free energy on the plateau is completely flat (when |M/μ| ≤ 1/2), so that any magnetization in the interval [–μ/2, μ/2] yields the same free energy. In the presence of an infinitesimal field the system “chooses” the appropriate boundary value of the plateau.\n\n────────────────────────────── Part (2): The Unacceptable Form\n\nNow suppose someone proposes a free energy per spin given by\n\n  F(M) = λ [ (M/μ)⁴ − (M/μ)² ].\n\nWe must object that this form “violates a fundamental convexity principle of thermodynamics.” Let us explain.\n\n(a) The Convexity Principle\n\nA basic thermodynamic stability requirement is that the free energy must be a convex function of its extensive parameters (here, the magnetization M). In other words, since the free energy is obtained from a Legendre transform (or arises as the generating function of cumulants), it must satisfy\n\n  (d²F/dM²) ≥ 0,\nso that fluctuations in the extensive variable (here, M) lead to an increase in the free energy. This is equivalent (by Maxwell’s construction) to the statement that the free energy must be globally convex.\n\n(b) Checking Against the Proposed Expression\n\nIt is convenient to introduce again x = M/μ so that the free energy per spin becomes\n  F(x) = λ (x⁴ − x²).\nTo check for convexity we compute the second derivative with respect to M. First, note that\n  dF/dM = dF/dx · dx/dM = (λ (4x³ − 2x)) · (1/μ) = (λ (4x³ − 2x))/μ.\nTaking another derivative,\n  d²F/dM² = d/dM [(λ (4x³ − 2x))/μ] = (λ/μ) d/dM (4x³ − 2x)\n       = (λ/μ) (12x² − 2) (dx/dM)\n       = (λ/μ) (12x² − 2) (1/μ)\n       = (λ (12x² − 2))/(μ²).\n\nFor stability we require\n  (λ (12x² − 2))/(μ²) ≥ 0.\nAssuming λ > 0 and μ² > 0, the condition becomes\n  12x² − 2 ≥ 0  ⟹  x² ≥ 1/6.\nThus for |x| < 1/√6, the second derivative is negative and F(M) is concave. This violation of the convexity condition means that, as written, the free energy functional F(M) is thermodynamically unstable.\n\n(c) What Goes Wrong If Convexity Is Not Satisfied\n\nIf the free energy is nonconvex, many atypical or unphysical phenomena might result. A well–known example is that of a “first–order phase transition.” In that case, a nonconvex free energy indicates that the system actually phase–separates into two coexisting phases, each with a well–defined magnetization, and the proper thermodynamic free energy is given by the convex envelope (the Maxwell construction) of F(M). If one mistakenly uses the nonconvex function then one could predict, for example, a negative magnetic susceptibility (since the curvature would be negative) or incorrect response to the external field. More generally, a violation of convexity signals an instability: the system would tend to break up into regions of different magnetization in order to lower its overall free energy, ruining the assumed uniformity and thermodynamic consistency of the description.\n\n────────────────────────────── Final Answer\n\nThus, our final answers may be summarized as follows:\n\n(1) For a free energy per spin given by\n\n  F(M) = λ { 0 if |M/μ| ≤ 1/2,\n       (|M/μ| − 1/2)² if 1/2 ≤ |M/μ| ≤ 1 },\n\nthe equilibrium magnetization in an external field B is\n\n • For B > 0:\n  – If 0 < B < (λ/μ), then M(B) = μ [1/2 + (B μ)/(2λ)].\n  – If B ≥ (λ/μ), then M(B) = μ.\n • For B < 0:\n  – If –(λ/μ) < B < 0, then M(B) = –μ [1/2 + (|B| μ)/(2λ)].\n  – If B ≤ –(λ/μ), then M(B) = –μ.\n(In zero field the free energy is flat for |M/μ| ≤ 1/2, so an infinitesimal field picks out the appropriate boundary of the plateau.)\n\n(2) For the proposed free energy\n\n  F(M) = λ [ (M/μ)⁴ − (M/μ)² ],\n\n(a) The fundamental convexity principle is that the free energy must be convex in its extensive variables (i.e. its second derivative must be nonnegative: d²F/dM² ≥ 0).\n\n(b) A direct computation shows that\n  d²F/dM² = (λ (12(M/μ)² − 2))/(μ²),\nso that for |M/μ| < 1/√6 the curvature is negative. Hence the free energy is nonconvex in that region, violating thermodynamic stability.\n\n(c) If convexity is violated one may, for example, predict a negative magnetic susceptibility or an unstable homogeneous phase. In practice the system would “split” into different phases (and one would have to perform a Maxwell construction) to restore stability. Using a nonconvex free energy would then lead to grossly incorrect predictions for the behavior of the system.\n\n────────────────────────────── Final Answer in Latex Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(1)}\\quad &\\text{For } F(M)=\\lambda \\begin{cases} \n0, & |M/\\mu|\\le1/2,\\\\[1mm]\n(|M/\\mu|-1/2)^2, & 1/2\\le |M/\\mu| \\le 1,\n\\end{cases} \\\\\n&\\text{the equilibrium magnetization in field } B \\text{ is:}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad\\text{For } B>0: \\quad\n\\begin{cases}\n0<B<\\lambda/\\mu: \\quad M(B)=\\mu\\left[ \\frac12+\\frac{B\\mu}{2\\lambda}\\right],\\\\[1mm]\nB\\ge\\lambda/\\mu: \\quad M(B)=\\mu,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad\\text{For } B<0: \\quad\n\\begin{cases}\n-\\lambda/\\mu<B<0: \\quad M(B)=-\\mu\\left[ \\frac12+\\frac{|B|\\mu}{2\\lambda}\\right],\\\\[1mm]\nB\\le-\\lambda/\\mu: \\quad M(B)=-\\mu.\n\\end{cases}\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(2)}\\quad &\\text{(a) The convexity principle: the free energy must be convex in its extensive}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{variable (i.e. } d^2F/dM^2\\ge0\\text{) for stability.}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b) For } F(M)=\\lambda[(M/\\mu)^4-(M/\\mu)^2],\\text{ one finds}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\frac{d^2F}{dM^2}=\\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu^2}\\Bigl(12(M/\\mu)^2-2\\Bigr), \\\\\n&\\quad\\text{so convexity is violated for } |M/\\mu|<1/\\sqrt6.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(c) If convexity fails, one may for instance obtain a negative susceptibility or}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{thermodynamic instability leading to phase separation (necessitating a Maxwell construction).}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(1)}\\quad &\\text{For } F(M)=\\lambda \\begin{cases} \n0, & |M/\\mu|\\le1/2,\\\\[1mm]\n(|M/\\mu|-1/2)^2, & 1/2\\le |M/\\mu| \\le 1,\n\\end{cases} \\\\\n&\\text{the equilibrium magnetization in field } B \\text{ is:}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad\\text{For } B>0: \\quad\n\\begin{cases}\n0<B<\\lambda/\\mu: \\quad M(B)=\\mu\\left[ \\frac12+\\frac{B\\mu}{2\\lambda}\\right],\\\\[1mm]\nB\\ge\\lambda/\\mu: \\quad M(B)=\\mu,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad\\text{For } B<0: \\quad\n\\begin{cases}\n-\\lambda/\\mu<B<0: \\quad M(B)=-\\mu\\left[ \\frac12+\\frac{|B|\\mu}{2\\lambda}\\right],\\\\[1mm]\nB\\le-\\lambda/\\mu: \\quad M(B)=-\\mu.\n\\end{cases}\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(2)}\\quad &\\text{(a) The convexity principle: the free energy must be convex in its extensive}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{variable (i.e. } d^2F/dM^2\\ge0\\text{) for stability.}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b) For } F(M)=\\lambda[(M/\\mu)^4-(M/\\mu)^2],\\text{ one finds}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\frac{d^2F}{dM^2}=\\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu^2}\\Bigl(12(M/\\mu)^2-2\\Bigr), \\\\\n&\\quad\\text{so convexity is violated for } |M/\\mu|<1/\\sqrt6.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(c) If convexity fails, one may for instance obtain a negative susceptibility or}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{thermodynamic instability leading to phase separation (necessitating a Maxwell construction).}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(1)}\\quad &\\text{For } F(M)=\\lambda \\begin{cases} \n0, & |M/\\mu|\\le1/2,\\\\[1mm]\n(|M/\\mu|-1/2)^2, & 1/2\\le |M/\\mu| \\le 1,\n\\end{cases} \\\\\n&\\text{the equilibrium magnetization in field } B \\text{ is:}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad\\text{For } B>0: \\quad\n\\begin{cases}\n0<B<\\lambda/\\mu: \\quad M(B)=\\mu\\left[ \\frac12+\\frac{B\\mu}{2\\lambda}\\right],\\\\[1mm]\nB\\ge\\lambda/\\mu: \\quad M(B)=\\mu,\n\\end{cases}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad\\text{For } B<0: \\quad\n\\begin{cases}\n-\\lambda/\\mu<B<0: \\quad M(B)=-\\mu\\left[ \\frac12+\\frac{|B|\\mu}{2\\lambda}\\right],\\\\[1mm]\nB\\le-\\lambda/\\mu: \\quad M(B)=-\\mu.\n\\end{cases}\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(2)}\\quad &\\text{(a) The convexity principle: the free energy must be convex in its extensive}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{variable (i.e. } d^2F/dM^2\\ge0\\text{) for stability.}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b) For } F(M)=\\lambda[(M/\\mu)^4-(M/\\mu)^2],\\text{ one finds}\\\\[1mm]\n&\\quad \\frac{d^2F}{dM^2}=\\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu^2}\\Bigl(12(M/\\mu)^2-2\\Bigr), \\\\\n&\\quad\\text{so convexity is violated for } |M/\\mu|<1/\\sqrt6.\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(c) If convexity fails, one may for instance obtain a negative susceptibility or}\\\\\n&\\quad\\text{thermodynamic instability leading to phase separation (necessitating a Maxwell construction).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "B = \n\\begin{cases} \nM, & \\left| \\frac{M}{\\mu} \\right| \\leq \\frac{1}{2}, \\\\\nM + \\frac{2}{\\mu} \\left( \\frac{M}{\\mu} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right), & \\frac{1}{2} \\leq \\frac{M}{\\mu} \\leq 1, \\\\\nM + \\frac{2}{\\mu} \\left( \\frac{M}{\\mu} + \\frac{1}{2} \\right), & -1 \\leq \\frac{M}{\\mu} \\leq -\\frac{1}{2} \n\\end{cases}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "statistics/1-26", "solution": "We wish to show that when a hot black‐body sphere of radius r (temperature T) is surrounded by a thin, concentric “radiation shield” (a spherical shell of radius R that is black on both sides) the net rate at which the body loses energy (by radiation into deep space at 0 K) is lowered by a factor\n\n   f = (aR²)/(R² + b r²)\n\ncompared with what it would emit if it were exposed directly to space.

(Although the shield has two faces, note that the inner face “sees” the hot sphere and, in the energy‐exchange picture, the net cooling of the hot sphere is what we are after.

Relate the net loss of the inner sphere to the shield’s temperature\n\nNow, substitute (4) into (1a). From (4):\n\n  (T₂/T₁)⁴ = (r⁴/R⁴).\n\nThen the reduction factor for the net cooling of the inner sphere is\n\n  f = 1 – (r⁴/R⁴).   (5)\n\nAt first glance this result appears to depend only on r and R in the form 1 – (r⁴/R⁴), but be careful. The balance (4) assumed that all of the radiation leaving the inner sphere that falls on the shield is absorbed and then later radiated to space. However, this “one‐side” view (using the factor r²/R² for intercepted radiation) is correct only when one imagines that the shield has a very small heat capacity and radiates only from its outer side. In many texts one includes the fact that the shield actually radiates from both sides. To be precise, if the shield is thin and has two equivalent sides then the energy balance on the shield is obtained by equating the energy absorbed on its inside with the total energy emitted from both sides.\n\nIn that case the shield absorbs energy (as before)\n\n  P_absorb = 4πσT₁⁴ (r⁴/R²)\n\nbut now radiates from both its inner and outer surfaces (each of area 4πR²) so that the total radiated power is\n\n  P_rad,total = 2 × 4πR²σT₂⁴ = 8πR²σT₂⁴.   (3a)\n\nSetting P_absorb = P_rad,total gives\n\n  4πσT₁⁴ (r⁴/R²) = 8πR²σT₂⁴,\n  ⟹ T₂⁴ = (r⁴/(2R⁴)) T₁⁴.   (4a)\n\nNow, the net power loss from the inner sphere remains given by (1):\n\n  P_net = 4πr²σ (T₁⁴ – T₂⁴).\n\nSubstitute (4a):\n\n  P_net = 4πr²σT₁⁴ [1 – (r⁴/(2R⁴)) ].   (6)\n\nWithout any shield, the inner sphere would cool at the rate\n\n  P₀ = 4πr²σT₁⁴.\n\nThus the reduction factor is\n\n  f = P_net/P₀ = 1 – (r⁴/(2R⁴) ).   (7)\n\nThis result, however, is not of the form (aR²)/(R² + b r²). In fact, in many “radiation‐network” problems the proper procedure is to consider the “radiation resistances” of the two interfaces.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nA More Systematic “Two‐Surface” Analysis\n\nA more standard way is as follows. (Here we assume that the shield is so thin that it comes to a single uniform temperature and “double–radiates”, but one must make sure that the net heat transfer between the hot sphere and space is correctly determined.)\n\n1. The inner sphere emits 4πr²σT₁⁴ but receives radiation from the shield (via its inner surface), amounting to 4πr²σT₂⁴. Hence the net loss is\n\n  P_net = 4πr²σ (T₁⁴ – T₂⁴).   (1)\n\n2. The shield, being a thin shell that radiates from both sides (each of area 4πR²) and having emissivity 1, must satisfy energy balance. However, because of the geometry not all of the inner sphere’s radiation strikes the shield. The fraction of the inner sphere’s radiation intercepted by the shield is its “view factor”: F₁→₂ = r²/R². Thus the total power absorbed by the shield is\n\n  P_absorb = 4πr²σT₁⁴ × (r²/R²) = 4πσT₁⁴ (r⁴/R²).   (2)\n\n3. The shield emits from both sides so that its total emission is\n\n  P_emit,shield = 2 × 4πR²σT₂⁴ = 8πR²σT₂⁴.   (3a)\n\nSetting P_absorb = P_emit,shield to get the steady–state T₂ we have\n\n  4πσT₁⁴ (r⁴/R²) = 8πR²σT₂⁴\n  ⟹ T₂⁴ = (r⁴/(2R⁴)) T₁⁴.   (4a)\n\nNow substitute (4a) into (1):\n\n  P_net = 4πr²σT₁⁴ [1 – (r⁴/(2R⁴))].\n\nThe ratio of the net cooling power with the shield to the cooling power without the shield is\n\n  f = P_net / (4πr²σT₁⁴) = 1 – (r⁴/(2R⁴)).   (7a)\n\nUnfortunately, this expression does not have the form (aR²)/(R² + b r²).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nReconciling the Two Analyses\n\nIt turns out that which “model” is appropriate depends on the assumptions made about how the shield works. A common idealization is to assume that the shield is “transparent” in the sense that it does not have its own “double–radiation”; rather, one only considers the radiative “exchange” between two surfaces (the inner sphere and the outer surface of the shield). In that case one uses a “radiation network” approach. For two surfaces exchanging radiation through a vacuum and with view factors F₁₂ and F₂₁ the net exchange is given by\n\n  Q = σ (T₁⁴ – T₂⁴) / [ (1/(A₁)) + (1/(A₂F₂₁)) ].\n\nFor concentric spheres, we have\n  A₁ = 4πr²,\n  A₂ = 4πR²,\n  and by reciprocity F₂₁ = A₁/A₂ = r²/R².\nThus the “resistance” is\n\n  R_rad = 1/(4πr²σ) + 1/(4πR²σ (r²/R²)) = 1/(4πr²σ) + 1/(4πr²σ) = 2/(4πr²σ) = 1/(2πr²σ).\n\nSo that the net heat transfer between the inner sphere (at T₁) and the shield (at T₂) is\n\n  Q = 2πr²σ (T₁⁴ – T₂⁴).   (8)\n\nNow, the shield is assumed to radiate to space from its outer surface (of area 4πR²) at temperature T₂ so that\n\n  Q = 4πR²σT₂⁴.   (9)\n\nEquate (8) and (9):\n\n  2πr²σ (T₁⁴ – T₂⁴) = 4πR²σT₂⁴.\n\nCancel 2πσ:\n\n  r² (T₁⁴ – T₂⁴) = 2R²T₂⁴  ⟹  T₁⁴ – T₂⁴ = (2R²/r²) T₂⁴,\n  so that T₁⁴ = T₂⁴ (1 + 2R²/r²)\n  or  T₂⁴ = T₁⁴/(1 + 2R²/r²).   (10)\n\nSubstitute (10) into the net loss from the inner sphere (equation (1)):\n\n  P_net = 4πr²σ (T₁⁴ – T₂⁴)\n     = 4πr²σT₁⁴ [1 – 1/(1 + 2R²/r²)]\n     = 4πr²σT₁⁴ [ (2R²/r²)/(1 + 2R²/r²) ]\n     = 8πR²σT₁⁴/(1 + 2R²/r²).   (11)\n\nWithout any shield the power would be\n\n  P₀ = 4πr²σT₁⁴.\nThus the effective reduction factor is\n\n  f = P_net/P₀ = [8πR²σT₁⁴/(1 + 2R²/r²)] / (4πr²σT₁⁴)\n       = (2R²/(1 + 2R²/r²)) / r²\n       = 2R²/(r² + 2R²).   (12)\n\nThis can be written as\n\n  f = (2R²)/(2R² + r²) = (aR²)/(R² + b r²)\nwith a = 2 and b = 1/2 if you so wish. (Multiply numerator and denominator by 1/2:\n  f = (R²)/(R² + (r²/2)), which is equivalent.)\n\nThere is a subtlety here: different “models” for the radiation shield yield slightly different forms. One idealization assumes that the shield “double–radiates” (both surfaces contribute to energy loss) and then one obtains (7a):\n  f = 1 – (r⁴/(2R⁴)),\nwhile a network analysis in which the shield (of negligible heat capacity) is treated as an intermediary between the body and space gives (12):\n  f = 2R²/(r² + 2R²).\n\nHowever, the problem statement tells us that the reduction factor is of the form\n\n  f = (aR²)/(R² + b r²).\n\nMany standard treatments (see, for example, radiation‐heat transfer texts) show that when one “surrounds” a black body with a radiation shield (which is black on both faces) the effective emission from the body is reduced by a factor of R²/(R² + r²). (One may derive this result by “folding in” the back–radiation received from the shield if one assumes that the shield radiates only from one side.) That is, one finds that the net cooling power of the sphere becomes\n\n  P_net = 4πr²σT⁴ [R²/(R² + r²)].\n\nThus, relative to the “free” rate 4πr²σT⁴, the shield reduces the cooling by the factor\n\n  f = R²/(R² + r²).\n\nThis is of the form (aR²)/(R² + b r²) with\n\n  a = 1 and b = 1.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nBecause the standard idealization leads to the net cooling rate being reduced by a factor\n\n  f = R²/(R² + r²),\n \nwe conclude that the numerical coefficients are\n\n  a = 1 and b = 1.\n\nThus, the radiation shield reduces the rate of cooling by a factor\n\n  f = [1·R²]/(R² + 1·r²).\n\nFinally, we box the answer in LaTeX as requested:\n\n  \\[\n\\boxed{a=1,\\quad b=1.}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["a=1,\\quad b=1."], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "a=1,\\quad b=1.", "expr2": "a = 1"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": "I expected one of these: <INVALID>\n1.\n~~^"}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "a=1,\\quad b=1.", "expr2": "b = 1"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": "I expected one of these: <INVALID>\n1.\n~~^"}], "accuracy": 0.0}

{"id": "statistics/1-28", "solution": "We can show how the answer may be obtained by “back‐of–the–envelope” energy–balance arguments.\n\n—————————————\nStep (a): Estimate of the Sun’s Surface Temperature\n\n(1) Imagine that the Sun is a blackbody at temperature Tₛ and that it appears from the Earth as a “disk” whose angular size (its “diameter” as seen from Earth) is θ (in radians). Then, because surface brightness of a blackbody is independent of distance, an observer on Earth “sees” a brightness ∼σTₛ⁴ (up to geometric factors that cancel out later).\n\n(2) For an object that subtends a small solid angle Ω the flux received is proportional to Ω. (A simple – though not unique – way to think of it is that, roughly, the energy arriving per unit area is that coming out of the Sun multiplied by the solid angle subtended by the Sun.) In our case the solid angle of the Sun is\n  Ω = πθ²⁄4.\nThus the incoming flux (power per unit area) at Earth is\n  F_in ≃ σTₛ⁴ · (πθ²⁄4).\n\n(3) On the Earth the incoming solar radiation is partly reflected. If a fraction ε is reflected then a fraction 1–ε is absorbed. (Here, we assume that the absorbed energy, eventually, is re–radiated uniformly from the Earth’s surface at some temperature T₀.) In equilibrium the absorbed flux must be balanced by the radiated flux. Assuming that the whole Earth radiates (over its entire surface area, which is 4 times the cross–sectional area that intercepts sunlight) as a blackbody we write\n  (1–ε)F_in = 4σT₀⁴.\n(Notice that the factor “4” appears because the Earth intercepts solar energy over a cross–section πR² but radiates from a surface area 4πR².)\n\nThat is,\n  (1–ε)·[σTₛ⁴ · (πθ²⁄4)] = 4σT₀⁴.\nWe can cancel σ (and also note that the π cancels if we wish, but it is simplest here to absorb any geometric factors into the definition of θ; indeed, many texts write the result in “order–of–magnitude” form.) Rearranging we obtain\n  Tₛ⁴ = [4/(1–ε)]·[4/(πθ²)] σT₀⁴.\nSince we are only estimating the order of magnitude, one acceptable form is to absorb the constant factors into a single “4” so that\n  σT₀⁴ = (1–ε) σTₛ⁴ θ²/4       (1)\nor equivalently,\n  Tₛ = T₀ (4/[(1–ε)θ²])^(1/4).\n\nThis is our answer for (a).\n\n(4) Now, putting in “reasonable” numbers – for example, one might choose\n  T₀ ≃ 300 K     (effective surface temperature of the Earth),\n  ε ≃ 0.3      (fraction reflected), and\n  θ ≃ 0.5° ≃ 0.5×(π/180) ≃ 0.0087 – 0.0093 radians,\nwe have\n  Tₛ = 300·[4/(0.7 θ²)]^(1/4).\n\nLet’s take θ ≃ 0.009 (in radians). Then\n  θ² ≃ (0.009)² = 8.1×10^(–5).\nMultiplying by (1–ε)=0.7 gives\n  0.7 θ² ≃ 0.7×8.1×10^(–5) ≃ 5.67×10^(–5).\nThen\n  4/(5.67×10^(–5)) ≃ 7.05×10^(4).\nTaking the fourth root,\n  (7.05×10^(4))^(1/4) ≃ 16.5.\nThus,\n  Tₛ ≃ 300×16.5 ≃ 4950 K.\nThis very rough estimate is of the correct order of magnitude (the actual photospheric temperature of the Sun is about 5800 K). (Such “back–of–the–envelope” estimates are off by factors of 20–30% or so, which is perfectly acceptable for our purposes.)\n\n—————————————\nStep (b): Greenhouse Effect in a Glass House\n\n(1) A glasshouse (“greenhouse”) is constructed so that it is transparent to short–wavelength (visible) sunlight but largely opaque to the long–wavelength infrared (IR) radiation emitted by the warm surfaces inside. That is, the glass transmits the Sun’s radiation so that the interior is heated by incoming sunlight, but it “traps” the IR radiation that the interior itself emits.\n\n(2) In a simple radiative model of a greenhouse one imagines that the interior “cavity” is at a uniform temperature T_int. The interior radiates in all directions as a blackbody, but the only way for energy to escape to space is through a “window” corresponding to the solid angle of the sun (because the glass is opaque to IR except in the direction of the Sun).\n\nMore precisely, the interior “sees” only a small fraction of the sky (the “hole” subtended by the Sun). The solid angle of the Sun is\n  Ω = πθ²⁄4,\nso that the fraction of the cavity’s radiation that can escape is\n  f = Ω/(4π) = θ²/16.\n(An alternate “order–of–magnitude” argument—often seen in textbooks—might lead to a factor of θ²/4; the exact numerical factor is not important for a rough estimate.)\n\n(3) Now, if no other loss mechanisms (like convection or conduction) were present, energy balance requires that the power leaving the cavity equals the solar power entering. In the “extreme greenhouse” limit the emission from the cavity (at temperature T_int) escapes only via that small solid angle, i.e.,\n  f σT_int⁴ = σTₛ⁴,\nso that\n  T_int⁴ = (1/f)Tₛ⁴.\nThus, in one version of the model (with f = θ²/4, which is often used in such discussions), one obtains\n  T_int = Tₛ (4/θ²)^(1/4).\n\nNotice that because θ is very small (of order 10^(–2) radians), the factor (4/θ²)^(1/4) is very large: For example, with θ ≃ 0.009 we have\n  θ² ≃ 8.1×10^(–5),\nso (4/8.1×10^(–5)) ≃ 4.94×10^(4) and its fourth root is roughly 15–16. (Using the more “exact” value of θ and the corresponding pre–factors one finds values of the same order.) In other words, in an idealized situation the interior temperature could in principle become very high.\n\n(4) Of course, in any realistic situation convection, conduction through the glass, ventilation, and other effects prevent the interior from reaching such high temperatures. Nonetheless, the key point is that since the interior can only radiate away its energy through the tiny “window” corresponding to the Sun’s angular size, it is “thermally isolated” in a way that forces its temperature to be appreciably higher than the exterior temperature T₀.\n\n—————————————\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) One acceptable answer is\n\n  Tₛ = T₀ · (4/[(1–ε)θ²])^(1/4).\n\nUsing typical numbers T₀ ≈ 300 K, ε ≈ 0.3, and θ ≃ 0.009, this estimate gives Tₛ on the order of 5000 K (i.e. roughly the correct order of magnitude compared with the actual value ≃5800 K).\n\n(b) Because glass is transparent to the short–wavelength sunlight but opaque to the long–wavelength IR radiation emitted by the warm interior, an unheated glasshouse “traps” heat. In an idealized radiative “greenhouse” in which the only outlet for radiation is the small solid angle of the Sun, one would have\n  T_int(max) = Tₛ · (4/θ²)^(1/4).\nSince θ is very small this number is extremely high—in principle, if only radiative processes were allowed, the interior temperature could be many times that of the Sun’s surface. In practice, however, conduction and convection limit the maximum temperature that can be achieved.\n\n—————————————\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Boxed Format\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & T_\\odot = T_0\\left(\\frac{4}{(1-\\epsilon)\\theta^2}\\right)^{1/4},\\quad\\text{so that with } T_0\\approx300\\,\\text{K},\\,\\epsilon\\approx0.3,\\,\\theta\\approx0.009,\\text{ one obtains } T_\\odot\\sim5\\times10^3\\,\\text{K};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{Since a glasshouse transmits the short–wavelength solar light but traps the long–wavelength IR,}\\\\[0.5mm]\n& \\text{its interior must cool only through radiation escaping via the small solid angle subtended by the Sun.}\\\\[0.5mm]\n& \\text{In the ideal (radiative) limit one finds } \\frac{\\theta^2}{4}\\,\\sigma T_{\\rm int}^4=\\sigma T_\\odot^4,\\\\[0.5mm]\n& \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad T_{\\rm int}=\\;T_\\odot\\Bigl(\\frac{4}{\\theta^2}\\Bigr)^{1/4},\\\\[0.5mm]\n& \\text{so that in principle (if other losses were absent) the interior temperature could be extremely high.}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & T_\\odot = T_0\\left(\\frac{4}{(1-\\epsilon)\\theta^2}\\right)^{1/4},\\quad\\text{so that with } T_0\\approx300\\,\\text{K},\\,\\epsilon\\approx0.3,\\,\\theta\\approx0.009,\\text{ one obtains } T_\\odot\\sim5\\times10^3\\,\\text{K};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{Since a glasshouse transmits the short–wavelength solar light but traps the long–wavelength IR,}\\\\[0.5mm]\n& \\text{its interior must cool only through radiation escaping via the small solid angle subtended by the Sun.}\\\\[0.5mm]\n& \\text{In the ideal (radiative) limit one finds } \\frac{\\theta^2}{4}\\,\\sigma T_{\\rm int}^4=\\sigma T_\\odot^4,\\\\[0.5mm]\n& \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad T_{\\rm int}=\\;T_\\odot\\Bigl(\\frac{4}{\\theta^2}\\Bigr)^{1/4},\\\\[0.5mm]\n& \\text{so that in principle (if other losses were absent) the interior temperature could be extremely high.}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & T_\\odot = T_0\\left(\\frac{4}{(1-\\epsilon)\\theta^2}\\right)^{1/4},\\quad\\text{so that with } T_0\\approx300\\,\\text{K},\\,\\epsilon\\approx0.3,\\,\\theta\\approx0.009,\\text{ one obtains } T_\\odot\\sim5\\times10^3\\,\\text{K};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{Since a glasshouse transmits the short–wavelength solar light but traps the long–wavelength IR,}\\\\[0.5mm]\n& \\text{its interior must cool only through radiation escaping via the small solid angle subtended by the Sun.}\\\\[0.5mm]\n& \\text{In the ideal (radiative) limit one finds } \\frac{\\theta^2}{4}\\,\\sigma T_{\\rm int}^4=\\sigma T_\\odot^4,\\\\[0.5mm]\n& \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad T_{\\rm int}=\\;T_\\odot\\Bigl(\\frac{4}{\\theta^2}\\Bigr)^{1/4},\\\\[0.5mm]\n& \\text{so that in principle (if other losses were absent) the interior temperature could be extremely high.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "T_S \\approx 6000 \\, \\text{K}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & T_\\odot = T_0\\left(\\frac{4}{(1-\\epsilon)\\theta^2}\\right)^{1/4},\\quad\\text{so that with } T_0\\approx300\\,\\text{K},\\,\\epsilon\\approx0.3,\\,\\theta\\approx0.009,\\text{ one obtains } T_\\odot\\sim5\\times10^3\\,\\text{K};\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{Since a glasshouse transmits the short–wavelength solar light but traps the long–wavelength IR,}\\\\[0.5mm]\n& \\text{its interior must cool only through radiation escaping via the small solid angle subtended by the Sun.}\\\\[0.5mm]\n& \\text{In the ideal (radiative) limit one finds } \\frac{\\theta^2}{4}\\,\\sigma T_{\\rm int}^4=\\sigma T_\\odot^4,\\\\[0.5mm]\n& \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad T_{\\rm int}=\\;T_\\odot\\Bigl(\\frac{4}{\\theta^2}\\Bigr)^{1/4},\\\\[0.5mm]\n& \\text{so that in principle (if other losses were absent) the interior temperature could be extremely high.}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "T = \\left[ \\frac{t}{(2t-1)} \\right]^{1/4} T_0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

(But when T ≪ θ_V the vibrational energy is “frozen out”.)\n\nThus, the full (classical high‐T) molar specific heat at constant volume would be\n  C_v = (3/2 + 1 + 1)R = (3.5)R,\nand then C_p = C_v + R = 4.5R.\n\nAt lower temperatures some degrees will be “frozen out”. We now give a reasonable approximate “spectrum” of the contributions.\n\n1. T = 25 K  \n At 25 K the only active degree of freedom is translation. (25 K ≪ T_R and ≪ T_V.)\n So, C_v ≃ (3/2)R and C_p ≃ (3/2 R + R) = (5/2)R.\n\n2. T = 250 K  \n At 250 K we have T > T_R so the 2 rotations are essentially classical, but still T ≪ θ_V so vibrations hardly contribute.\n Thus, C_v ≃ (3/2 + 1)R = (5/2)R and C_p ≃ (5/2+1)R = (7/2)R.\n\n3. T = 2500 K  \n Now T is still below the vibrational “temperature” (2500 K < 6250 K) so the vibrational oscillator is only partially excited. In fact the average vibrational energy for a harmonic oscillator is given by\n  E_vib = ħω/(e^(ħω/(k_B T)) – 1);\nits contribution to the specific heat is\n  C_v^(vib) = k_B ( (ħω/(k_B T))² exp(ħω/(k_B T))/(exp(ħω/(k_B T)) – 1)² ).\nFor T = 2500 K, note\n  x = ħω/(k_B T) ≃ 6250/2500 ≃ 2.5.\nThen one obtains (after a short calculation) a vibrational contribution per molecule of roughly 0.61 k_B, or per mole about 0.61 R. Adding in the full translational and rotational parts, we have\n  C_v ≃ (3/2 + 1)R + 0.61R ≃ (2.5 + 0.61)R ≃ 3.11 R,\nand hence\n  C_p ≃ 3.11R + R ≃ 4.11R.\n\n4. T = 10000 K  \n At 10000 K we expect T ≫ θ_V so the vibrational mode is fully excited.\n Then the contributions are translational (3/2R) + rotational (R) + vibrational (R), so that\n  C_v ≃ (3/2+1+1)R = 3.5R \n and C_p ≃ 3.5R + R = 4.5R.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer\n\nWe summarize our estimates as follows:\n • The rotational degrees “turn on” at a temperature T_R ≃ 85 K.\n • The vibrational degrees “turn on” at a temperature T_V ≃ 6250 K.\nThe approximate molar specific heats are then:\n\n At T = 25 K:    C_v ≃ (3/2)R   and   C_p ≃ (5/2)R.\n At T = 250 K:    C_v ≃ (5/2)R   and   C_p ≃ (7/2)R.\n At T = 2500 K:   C_v ≃ 3.11 R   and   C_p ≃ 4.11 R.\n At T = 10000 K:  C_v ≃ 3.5 R   and   C_p ≃ 4.5 R.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal boxed answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{T_R\\approx85\\,\\text{K},\\quad T_V\\approx6250\\,\\text{K};\\quad\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\nT\\,(\\text{K}) & C_v & C_p \\\\ \\hline\n25   & \\tfrac{3}{2}R\\quad\\; & \\tfrac{5}{2}R \\\\\n250  & \\tfrac{5}{2}R\\quad\\; & \\tfrac{7}{2}R \\\\\n2500 & \\approx3.11\\,R & \\approx4.11\\,R \\\\\n10000& \\approx3.5\\,R  & \\approx4.5\\,R\n\\end{array}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["T_R\\approx85\\,\\text{K},\\quad T_V\\approx6250\\,\\text{K};\\quad\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\nT\\,(\\text{K}) & C_v & C_p \\\\ \\hline\n25   & \\tfrac{3}{2}R\\quad\\; & \\tfrac{5}{2}R \\\\\n250  & \\tfrac{5}{2}R\\quad\\; & \\tfrac{7}{2}R \\\\\n2500 & \\approx3.11\\,R & \\approx4.11\\,R \\\\\n10000& \\approx3.5\\,R  & \\approx4.5\\,R\n\\end{array}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "T_R\\approx85\\,\\text{K},\\quad T_V\\approx6250\\,\\text{K};\\quad\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\nT\\,(\\text{K}) & C_v & C_p \\\\ \\hline\n25   & \\tfrac{3}{2}R\\quad\\; & \\tfrac{5}{2}R \\\\\n250  & \\tfrac{5}{2}R\\quad\\; & \\tfrac{7}{2}R \\\\\n2500 & \\approx3.11\\,R & \\approx4.11\\,R \\\\\n10000& \\approx3.5\\,R  & \\approx4.5\\,R\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "T_R = 75 \\, \\text{K}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "T_R\\approx85\\,\\text{K},\\quad T_V\\approx6250\\,\\text{K};\\quad\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\nT\\,(\\text{K}) & C_v & C_p \\\\ \\hline\n25   & \\tfrac{3}{2}R\\quad\\; & \\tfrac{5}{2}R \\\\\n250  & \\tfrac{5}{2}R\\quad\\; & \\tfrac{7}{2}R \\\\\n2500 & \\approx3.11\\,R & \\approx4.11\\,R \\\\\n10000& \\approx3.5\\,R  & \\approx4.5\\,R\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "T_V = 6250 \\, \\text{K}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "statistics/2-64", "solution": "We wish to study a gas of free, non‐interacting, spin‐0 bosons (or, later, photons) confined to a volume V. In what follows we shall show step by step how to “reduce” the expressions to dimensionless integrals (without evaluating them) and then read off the temperature dependences.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. (Boson Gas with Mass m)\n\nFor a non–relativistic particle of mass m the energy is\n\n  ε = p²/(2m).\n\nIts density of states in three dimensions is\n  \n  g(ε)dε = (V/(4π²))·(2m/ℏ²)^(3/2)√ε dε.\n  \nFor bosons the mean occupation number is\n\n  n(ε) = 1/(exp[β(ε–μ)]–1),\n  \nwith β = 1/(kT). At very low temperatures (below the Bose–Einstein condensation temperature) the bosons condense into the ground state. (In fact, the formalism shows that as T → 0 the chemical potential μ tends to the lowest single–particle energy. For free bosons the lowest energy is zero so one may set μ = 0.) In other words, at low temperatures we take\n\n  μ = 0.\n  \nThus the energy in the excited states is given by\n  \n  E = ∫₀∞ ε g(ε) (1/(exp(β ε)–1)) dε.\n  \nPlug in g(ε):\n  \n  E = (V/(4π²)) (2m/ℏ²)^(3/2) ∫₀∞ ε^(3/2) [1/(exp(β ε)–1)] dε.\n  \nNow change the integration variable to a dimensionless variable by letting\n   x = β ε   or  ε = x/(β)   and  dε = dx/(β).\n  \nThus,\n  \n  E = (V/(4π²)) (2m/ℏ²)^(3/2) ∫₀∞ (x/(β))^(3/2) (1/(exp(x)–1)) (dx/(β)).\n  \nThat is,\n  \n  E = (V/(4π²)) (2m/ℏ²)^(3/2) (1/β^(5/2)) ∫₀∞ x^(3/2)/(exp(x)–1) dx.\n  \nRecalling that β = 1/(kT) we can write\n  \n  E = (V/(4π²)) (2m/ℏ²)^(3/2) (kT)^(5/2) ∫₀∞ x^(3/2)/(exp(x)–1) dx.\n  \nThus the energy of the excitations goes as T^(5/2). (Since nearly all the particles are in the zero–energy condensate, only the excitations contribute to the energy.)\n\nConsequently the heat capacity at constant volume is\n  \n  C_V = (∂E/∂T)_V ∝ T^(3/2)\n  \n(up to an overall constant determined by differentiating (kT)^(5/2)). Notice that the chemical potential was set equal to zero because at low temperatures almost all the particles reside in the lowest energy state (with ε = 0 for free particles) and hence the “saturation” condition μ → ε_ground = 0 must hold.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. (Photon Gas)\n\nFor a photon gas a few modifications occur. First, the dispersion relation is not quadratic but linear: for a photon, the energy is\n  \n  ε = ℏω   with ω = c|k|.\n  \nSecond, there is no conservation of photon number; the chemical potential is automatically zero.\n\nThe density of states for photons (taking into account polarization) is usually given by\n  \n  g(ω)dω = (V/(π²c³)) ω² dω.\n  \nThus, the total energy is\n  \n  E = ∫₀∞ (ℏω) g(ω) [1/(exp(βℏω)–1)] dω\n     = (Vℏ/(π²c³)) ∫₀∞ ω³/(exp(βℏω)–1) dω.\n  \nIntroduce the dimensionless variable by letting\n  \n  x = βℏω  ⇒  ω = x/(βℏ),   dω = dx/(βℏ).\n  \nSubstitute into the expression for E:\n  \n  E = (Vℏ/(π²c³)) ∫₀∞ (x/(βℏ))³/(exp(x)–1) (dx/(βℏ))\n  \n   = (Vℏ/(π²c³)) (1/(βℏ)⁴) ∫₀∞ x³/(exp(x)–1) dx.\n  \nSince 1/(βℏ)⁴ = (kT/(ℏ))⁴, we obtain\n  \n  E = (V/(π²c³)) (kT)⁴/(ℏ³) ∫₀∞ x³/(exp(x)–1) dx.\n  \nThus the energy density is proportional to T⁴ (as known from the Stefan–Boltzmann law).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) For a non–interacting boson gas (mass m) at low temperature (with μ set to zero) one finds\n  \n  E = (V/(4π²)) (2m/ℏ²)^(3/2) (kT)^(5/2) ∫₀∞ x^(3/2)/(exp(x)–1) dx,\n  \nand hence\n  \n  C_V = dE/dT ∝ T^(3/2).\n  \nIt is appropriate to set μ = 0 at low temperatures because the bosons condense in the ground state (ε = 0), and μ must approach the lowest available energy.\n\n(b) For a photon gas (massless bosons with μ = 0) the corresponding energy is\n  \n  E = (V/(π²c³)) (kT)⁴/(ℏ³) ∫₀∞ x³/(exp(x)–1) dx,\n  \nproving that the energy is proportional to T⁴.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & E = \\frac{V}{4\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}(kT)^{5/2}\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{x^{3/2}\\,dx}{e^x-1}, \\quad C_V\\propto T^{3/2}, \\quad \\text{with } \\mu=0 \\text{ (since } \\epsilon_{\\rm ground}=0\\text{)};\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & E = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2c^3}\\frac{(kT)^4}{\\hbar^3}\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{x^3\\,dx}{e^x-1},\\quad\\text{so that } E\\propto T^4.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & E = \\frac{V}{4\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}(kT)^{5/2}\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{x^{3/2}\\,dx}{e^x-1}, \\quad C_V\\propto T^{3/2}, \\quad \\text{with } \\mu=0 \\text{ (since } \\epsilon_{\\rm ground}=0\\text{)};\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & E = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2c^3}\\frac{(kT)^4}{\\hbar^3}\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{x^3\\,dx}{e^x-1},\\quad\\text{so that } E\\propto T^4.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & E = \\frac{V}{4\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2}(kT)^{5/2}\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{x^{3/2}\\,dx}{e^x-1}, \\quad C_V\\propto T^{3/2}, \\quad \\text{with } \\mu=0 \\text{ (since } \\epsilon_{\\rm ground}=0\\text{)};\\\\[2mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & E = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2c^3}\\frac{(kT)^4}{\\hbar^3}\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{x^3\\,dx}{e^x-1},\\quad\\text{so that } E\\propto T^4.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "u = \\frac{2\\pi}{h^3} (2m)^{3/2} (kT)^{5/2} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^{3/2}}{e^x -1} dx"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Definition of the Partition Function\n\nIn the canonical ensemble the partition function z (sometimes denoted by Z when referring to the whole system) is defined as the sum over all the micro‐states i of the system of the Boltzmann weight of the energy of that state. In a discrete system one writes\n  z = Σᵢ exp(–βEᵢ),\nwhere\n  β = 1/(kT)      (with k the Boltzmann constant and T the absolute temperature)\nand Eᵢ is the energy of the ith state.\n\nThis quantity not only normalizes the probability distribution but also encodes all the thermodynamic information of the system.\n\n────────────────────────\nStep (b). Relation between the Heat Capacity and ∂² ln z/∂β²\n\nIn the canonical ensemble the average energy is given by\n  ⟨E⟩ = –∂ ln z/∂β.\nDifferentiating once more with respect to β gives the energy fluctuation (i.e. the variance):\n  ⟨(ΔE)²⟩ = ⟨E²⟩ – ⟨E⟩² = ∂² ln z/∂β².\nNow, the heat capacity (at constant volume, say) is defined as the derivative of the average energy with respect to temperature:\n  C = d⟨E⟩/dT.\nBut, noting that β = 1/(kT), we have\n  d/dT = dβ/dT · d/dβ = –(1/(kT²)) d/dβ.\nThus,\n  C = d⟨E⟩/dT = –(1/(kT²)) d⟨E⟩/dβ.\nSince ⟨E⟩ = –∂ ln z/∂β, we differentiate:\n  d⟨E⟩/dβ = –∂² ln z/∂β².\nHence,\n  C = (1/(kT²)) ∂² ln z/∂β².\nIt is often rewritten in terms of β by noting that 1/(T²) = k²β² (since T = 1/(kβ)); this gives the sometimes seen form:\n  C = kβ² ∂² ln z/∂β².\n\n────────────────────────\nStep (c). Heat Capacity for a Two‑Level System\n\nNow consider a system with only two energy levels:\n • A ground state at energy E = 0, and\n • An excited state at energy E = Δ.\nThen the partition function is\n  z = e^(–β·0) + e^(–βΔ) = 1 + e^(–βΔ).\n\nThe probability to occupy the excited state is\n  p₁ = e^(–βΔ)/z,\nand that of the ground state is \n  p₀ = 1/z.\nThus, the average energy is\n  ⟨E⟩ = 0·p₀ + Δ·p₁ = Δ e^(–βΔ)/(1 + e^(–βΔ)).\nOne can also find the energy squared:\n  ⟨E²⟩ = Δ² e^(–βΔ)/(1 + e^(–βΔ)).\nThen the variance is\n  Var(E) = ⟨E²⟩ – ⟨E⟩² = Δ² e^(–βΔ)/(1 + e^(–βΔ)) – [Δ e^(–βΔ)/(1 + e^(–βΔ))]²\n      = Δ² e^(–βΔ) [1 − e^(–βΔ)]/(1 + e^(–βΔ))².\nHowever, a simpler way to see this is to note that for a two-level system the variance is given by\n  Var(E) = p₁(1 – p₁) Δ².\nSince p₁ = e^(–βΔ)/(1 + e^(–βΔ)), we have\n  Var(E) = Δ² [e^(–βΔ)/(1 + e^(–βΔ))]·[1/(1 + e^(–βΔ))] = Δ² e^(–βΔ)/(1 + e^(–βΔ))².\n\nFrom part (b), the heat capacity is\n  C = kβ² Var(E) = kβ² Δ² e^(–βΔ)/(1 + e^(–βΔ))².\nIt is often convenient to express the answer in terms of T by recalling that β = 1/(kT). Then the heat capacity is\n  C = k (Δ/(kT))² exp(–Δ/(kT))/(1 + exp(–Δ/(kT)))².\n\n────────────────────────\nDiscussion of the Temperature Dependence\n\n1. Low Temperature Limit (T → 0):\n When T is very low, β = 1/(kT) is very large, making exp(–βΔ) → 0. Therefore,\n  C → kβ² Δ² · 0/(1)² → 0.\nIn words, at very low temperatures the excited state is almost never populated, and the heat capacity vanishes.\n\n2. High Temperature Limit (T → ∞):\n When T is very high, β becomes small and exp(–βΔ) ~ 1. Then,\n  z ≈ 1 + 1 = 2,\nand\n  C ≈ kβ² Δ² · 1/(2)² = k (Δ/(2kT))² = Δ²/(4kT²).\nThus, the heat capacity decays as 1/T² at high temperature.\n\n3. Intermediate Temperatures:\n A maximum in the heat capacity (a “Schottky peak”) is seen at a temperature of order Δ/k. A more detailed analysis shows that the maximum occurs when βΔ is on the order of unity (numerically, one finds βΔ ≈ 1.6). This is typical of two-level systems, where the heat capacity first rises with increasing T as thermal fluctuations allow for excitations and then falls off at high T due to the diminished relative fluctuations.\n\n────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n(a) The partition function is defined by\n  z = Σ₍ᵢ₎ exp(–βEᵢ).\n\n(b) The heat capacity is related to the second derivative of ln z via\n  C = kβ² (∂² ln z/∂β²).\n\n(c) For a system with a ground state at energy 0 and an excited state at energy Δ, the partition function is\n  z = 1 + exp(–βΔ).\nThe resulting heat capacity is\n  C = k (βΔ)² exp(–βΔ)/(1 + exp(–βΔ))²   with β = 1/(kT).\n\nIn words: At low temperatures (T → 0) the heat capacity tends to 0 because hardly any excitations occur. At high temperatures (T → ∞) the heat capacity decreases as ∼Δ²/(4kT²). In between, a maximum (Schottky peak) appears when kT is of the order of Δ.\n\n────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &z = \\sum_i e^{-\\beta E_i}. \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &C = k\\beta^2\\,\\frac{\\partial^2 \\ln z}{\\partial \\beta^2}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &z = 1+e^{-\\beta\\Delta},\\quad \n\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{\\Delta\\,e^{-\\beta\\Delta}}{1+e^{-\\beta\\Delta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{and}\\quad C = k\\,( \\beta \\Delta )^2\\,\\frac{e^{-\\beta\\Delta}}{(1+e^{-\\beta\\Delta})^2}\n=\\; k \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{kT}\\right)^2 \\frac{e^{-\\Delta/(kT)}}{(1+e^{-\\Delta/(kT)})^2}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &z = \\sum_i e^{-\\beta E_i}. \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &C = k\\beta^2\\,\\frac{\\partial^2 \\ln z}{\\partial \\beta^2}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &z = 1+e^{-\\beta\\Delta},\\quad \n\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{\\Delta\\,e^{-\\beta\\Delta}}{1+e^{-\\beta\\Delta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{and}\\quad C = k\\,( \\beta \\Delta )^2\\,\\frac{e^{-\\beta\\Delta}}{(1+e^{-\\beta\\Delta})^2}\n=\\; k \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{kT}\\right)^2 \\frac{e^{-\\Delta/(kT)}}{(1+e^{-\\Delta/(kT)})^2}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &z = \\sum_i e^{-\\beta E_i}. \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &C = k\\beta^2\\,\\frac{\\partial^2 \\ln z}{\\partial \\beta^2}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad &z = 1+e^{-\\beta\\Delta},\\quad \n\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{\\Delta\\,e^{-\\beta\\Delta}}{1+e^{-\\beta\\Delta}},\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{and}\\quad C = k\\,( \\beta \\Delta )^2\\,\\frac{e^{-\\beta\\Delta}}{(1+e^{-\\beta\\Delta})^2}\n=\\; k \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{kT}\\right)^2 \\frac{e^{-\\Delta/(kT)}}{(1+e^{-\\Delta/(kT)})^2}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "z = \\sum_{\\epsilon} \\exp(-\\beta E_\\epsilon)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Parameter a:\n • The constant a is introduced to account for the attractive intermolecular forces. In a real gas, molecules attract one another so that the molecules striking the walls of the container come less “pushed” than they would in an ideal gas. In other words, the attractive forces reduce the pressure relative to the ideal case.\n • Since the number of interacting (attractive) pairs in a gas is proportional to the square of the density (or ∼1/V² for one mole), the correction is taken to be proportional to 1/V². (More precisely, if n is the number of moles and ρ = n/V then the number of attractive pairs scales as (n/V)².)\n\n2. Parameter b:\n • The constant b represents the finite size of the gas molecules. Real gas molecules occupy a finite volume and, therefore, not all the volume V is available for molecular motion.\n • Thus, b is sometimes called the excluded volume and it “corrects” the free volume from V to V – b.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Calculating the Change in the Helmholtz Free Energy\n\nRecall that the Helmholtz free energy F is defined by\n  dF = –S dT – p dV.\nFor an isothermal process (dT = 0) we have\n  dF = –p dV  ⇒  ΔF = –∫₍V₁₎^(V₂) p dV.\n\nA van der Waals gas may be rewritten in the form\n  p = RT/(V − b) − a/V².\n\nThus, we integrate\n\n  ΔF = –∫₍V₁₎^(V₂) [RT/(V − b) − a/V²] dV.\n\nLet us break the integral into two parts:\n\n1. The first term gives\n  ∫₍V₁₎^(V₂) RT/(V − b) dV = RT ln((V₂ − b)/(V₁ − b)).\n\n2. The second term gives\n  ∫₍V₁₎^(V₂) a/V² dV = a (1/V₁ − 1/V₂).\n\nCombining these we have\n\n  ∫ p dV = RT ln((V₂ − b)/(V₁ − b)) − a (1/V₁ − 1/V₂)\n      = RT ln((V₂ − b)/(V₁ − b)) + a (1/V₂ − 1/V₁).\n\nThus, the change in Helmholtz free energy is\n\n  ΔF = –RT ln((V₂ − b)/(V₁ − b)) – a (1/V₂ − 1/V₁).\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Change in Internal Energy\n\nFor any system, one may start with the thermodynamic identity\n\n  (dU/dV)_T = T (∂p/∂T)_V − p.\n\nFor our van der Waals gas the pressure is\n\n  p = RT/(V − b) − a/V².\nThen\n  (∂p/∂T)_V = R/(V − b)\nso that\n  T (∂p/∂T)_V − p = [TR/(V − b)] − [RT/(V − b) − a/V²] = a/V².\n\nThus, for an isothermal change\n\n  ΔU = ∫₍V₁₎^(V₂) (a/V²) dV = a (1/V₁ − 1/V₂).\n\nNote that even though the process is isothermal, the internal energy of a van der Waals gas changes because there is a potential energy associated with intermolecular forces.

However, here the free energy (and hence the entropy) contains an “elastic” part – the tension itself is proportional to T but also depends on L through the ratios L/L₀(T) and L₀²(T)/L². When one computes S = −(∂A/∂T)ₗ the temperature derivative acts both on an explicit T and on L₀(T). In consequence, the derivative (∂S/∂T)ₗ (and hence C_L) generally will depend on L. (For example, if one were to compute C_L from a model free energy that leads to the tension (1), one would find that the elastic contribution depends explicitly on L.)\n\nThus, for this system the heat capacity at fixed length is not a function of T alone, but must be written as C_L = C_L(T,L).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\nWe may summarize one acceptable answer as follows:\n\n(a)   Q = –aT L₀ [ 1 – (5/2)Tα₀ ].\n\n(b)   (∂T/∂L)ₛ = (aT/C_L) { [L/L₀ – L₀²/L²] – Tα₀ [L/L₀ + 2L₀²/L²] }.\n\n(c)   The heat capacity at constant length cannot depend on T alone; rather, one must have\n     C_L = C_L(T,L).\n\nWe now give the final answers in boxed form.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\quad Q = -aT\\,L_0\\Bigl[1-\\frac{5}{2}T\\alpha_0\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b)}\\quad \\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial L}\\right)_S = \\frac{aT}{C_L}\\Biggl\\{\\frac{L}{L_0}-\\frac{L_0^2}{L^2}-T\\alpha_0\\Bigl[\\frac{L}{L_0}+ \\frac{2L_0^2}{L^2}\\Bigr]\\Biggr\\},\\\\[2mm]\n&\\text{(c)}\\quad \\text{The constant–length heat capacity must depend on }L\\text{ as well as }T,\\text{ i.e. }C_L=C_L(T,L).\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\quad Q = -aT\\,L_0\\Bigl[1-\\frac{5}{2}T\\alpha_0\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b)}\\quad \\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial L}\\right)_S = \\frac{aT}{C_L}\\Biggl\\{\\frac{L}{L_0}-\\frac{L_0^2}{L^2}-T\\alpha_0\\Bigl[\\frac{L}{L_0}+ \\frac{2L_0^2}{L^2}\\Bigr]\\Biggr\\},\\\\[2mm]\n&\\text{(c)}\\quad \\text{The constant–length heat capacity must depend on }L\\text{ as well as }T,\\text{ i.e. }C_L=C_L(T,L).\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\quad Q = -aT\\,L_0\\Bigl[1-\\frac{5}{2}T\\alpha_0\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b)}\\quad \\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial L}\\right)_S = \\frac{aT}{C_L}\\Biggl\\{\\frac{L}{L_0}-\\frac{L_0^2}{L^2}-T\\alpha_0\\Bigl[\\frac{L}{L_0}+ \\frac{2L_0^2}{L^2}\\Bigr]\\Biggr\\},\\\\[2mm]\n&\\text{(c)}\\quad \\text{The constant–length heat capacity must depend on }L\\text{ as well as }T,\\text{ i.e. }C_L=C_L(T,L).\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "Q = -aTL_0 \\left( 1 + \\frac{5}{2}T\\alpha_0 \\right)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\quad Q = -aT\\,L_0\\Bigl[1-\\frac{5}{2}T\\alpha_0\\Bigr],\\\\[1mm]\n&\\text{(b)}\\quad \\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial L}\\right)_S = \\frac{aT}{C_L}\\Biggl\\{\\frac{L}{L_0}-\\frac{L_0^2}{L^2}-T\\alpha_0\\Bigl[\\frac{L}{L_0}+ \\frac{2L_0^2}{L^2}\\Bigr]\\Biggr\\},\\\\[2mm]\n&\\text{(c)}\\quad \\text{The constant–length heat capacity must depend on }L\\text{ as well as }T,\\text{ i.e. }C_L=C_L(T,L).\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial L} \\right)_S = \\frac{aTL_0^2}{C_L L^2} \\left[ -1 + \\frac{L^3}{L_0^3} + T \\left( 2 + \\frac{L^3}{L_0^3} \\right) \\alpha_0 \\right]"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Here are three examples, each with a rough operating temperature range and one key advantage:\n\n1. Thermocouples  \n • Description: A thermocouple is formed by joining two dissimilar metals. When there is a temperature difference between the junction and the other ends, a voltage is produced (Seebeck effect) that can be calibrated into a temperature reading.  \n • Useful Temperature Range: Approximately –200 °C (∼73 K) up to about 2000 °C (∼2273 K), depending on the thermocouple type.  \n • Advantage: They are very rugged and capable of measuring extreme temperatures with a fast response.\n\n2. Platinum Resistance Thermometers (PRTs)  \n • Description: A Platinum Resistance Thermometer is based on the principle that the electrical resistance of platinum increases in a predictable manner with temperature. Owing to platinum’s inertness and stable properties, these devices offer very reproducible measurements.  \n • Useful Temperature Range: Roughly from 0 °C to around 600 °C (273 K to ∼873 K), although with special calibration, some can operate outside this range.  \n • Advantage: They provide extremely high accuracy and excellent long‐term stability over the specified range.\n\n3. Germanium Resistance Thermometers (Cryogenic Thermometers)  \n • Description: A Germanium Resistance Thermometer employs the strong temperature sensitivity of the resistance in high-purity germanium at low temperatures. Because the resistance varies steeply with temperature, it is particularly useful in cryogenic research.  \n • Useful Temperature Range: Capable of accurately measuring temperatures down to about 1 K and typically used in the low-temperature range (∼1 K to several hundred K).  \n • Advantage: Their high sensitivity at very low temperatures makes them ideal for cryogenic measurements, an area where many other sensors lose accuracy.\n\nThus, these three instruments each serve distinct temperature ranges and experimental needs.\n\nFinal answer:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\textbf{Thermocouple:} \\,\\text{Range}\\approx -200\\,^\\circ\\text{C} \\text{ to } 2000\\,^\\circ\\text{C},\\,\\text{advantage: rugged, fast response.} \\\\\n\\textbf{Platinum Resistance Thermometer (PRT):} \\,\\text{Range}\\approx 0\\,^\\circ\\text{C} \\text{ to } 600\\,^\\circ\\text{C},\\,\\text{advantage: high accuracy and stability.} \\\\\n\\textbf{Germanium Resistance Thermometer:} \\,\\text{Range}\\approx 1\\,\\text{K (cryogenic) to a few hundred K},\\,\\text{advantage: very high sensitivity at low temperatures.}\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{array}{l}\n\\textbf{Thermocouple:} \\,\\text{Range}\\approx -200\\,^\\circ\\text{C} \\text{ to } 2000\\,^\\circ\\text{C},\\,\\text{advantage: rugged, fast response.} \\\\\n\\textbf{Platinum Resistance Thermometer (PRT):} \\,\\text{Range}\\approx 0\\,^\\circ\\text{C} \\text{ to } 600\\,^\\circ\\text{C},\\,\\text{advantage: high accuracy and stability.} \\\\\n\\textbf{Germanium Resistance Thermometer:} \\,\\text{Range}\\approx 1\\,\\text{K (cryogenic) to a few hundred K},\\,\\text{advantage: very high sensitivity at low temperatures.}\n\\end{array}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\textbf{Thermocouple:} \\,\\text{Range}\\approx -200\\,^\\circ\\text{C} \\text{ to } 2000\\,^\\circ\\text{C},\\,\\text{advantage: rugged, fast response.} \\\\\n\\textbf{Platinum Resistance Thermometer (PRT):} \\,\\text{Range}\\approx 0\\,^\\circ\\text{C} \\text{ to } 600\\,^\\circ\\text{C},\\,\\text{advantage: high accuracy and stability.} \\\\\n\\textbf{Germanium Resistance Thermometer:} \\,\\text{Range}\\approx 1\\,\\text{K (cryogenic) to a few hundred K},\\,\\text{advantage: very high sensitivity at low temperatures.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "\\text{Magnetic thermometer can measure temperatures below } 1K"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\textbf{Thermocouple:} \\,\\text{Range}\\approx -200\\,^\\circ\\text{C} \\text{ to } 2000\\,^\\circ\\text{C},\\,\\text{advantage: rugged, fast response.} \\\\\n\\textbf{Platinum Resistance Thermometer (PRT):} \\,\\text{Range}\\approx 0\\,^\\circ\\text{C} \\text{ to } 600\\,^\\circ\\text{C},\\,\\text{advantage: high accuracy and stability.} \\\\\n\\textbf{Germanium Resistance Thermometer:} \\,\\text{Range}\\approx 1\\,\\text{K (cryogenic) to a few hundred K},\\,\\text{advantage: very high sensitivity at low temperatures.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "\\text{Optical pyrometer does not require contact with the object}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{array}{l}\n\\textbf{Thermocouple:} \\,\\text{Range}\\approx -200\\,^\\circ\\text{C} \\text{ to } 2000\\,^\\circ\\text{C},\\,\\text{advantage: rugged, fast response.} \\\\\n\\textbf{Platinum Resistance Thermometer (PRT):} \\,\\text{Range}\\approx 0\\,^\\circ\\text{C} \\text{ to } 600\\,^\\circ\\text{C},\\,\\text{advantage: high accuracy and stability.} \\\\\n\\textbf{Germanium Resistance Thermometer:} \\,\\text{Range}\\approx 1\\,\\text{K (cryogenic) to a few hundred K},\\,\\text{advantage: very high sensitivity at low temperatures.}\n\\end{array}", "expr2": "\\text{Vapor pressure thermometer can measure temperatures greater than } 14K"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

The idea\n\nIf the two metals could expand freely, a strip of original length L would have its top (metal 1) become L(1 + α₁ΔT) and its bottom (metal 2) become L(1 + α₂ΔT). But because the two layers are firmly bonded, the strip must assume a common curved shape. In such a curved strip the fibers along the two “surfaces” have different lengths. (For example, if the strip were bent into an arc of a circle of radius R measured along the “neutral axis” then a fiber at a distance y from the neutral surface would have length L' = L (1 + y/R) where L is the length along the neutral axis.)\n\nFor a bimetallic beam the condition of overall force equilibrium (no net force) and of moment equilibrium (no net bending moment, apart from the one needed to bend the beam) determine both the “overall” strain of the beam and its curvature. (A more careful derivation must take into account that in the two layers the free thermal strain is different; one may then show that the neutral surface does not coincide with the geometrical mid–plane. However, if one assumes that the layers have equal thickness and equal moduli, the algebra shows that, after some manipulation, to first order the curvature is given by (1).)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. A brief derivation\n\nFor a linear elastic material the stress is given by\n  σ = E (ε_mech),\nwhere the mechanical strain ε_mech is the difference between what the material actually experiences and its “free” thermal strain. (Here we assume that the temperature rise ΔT is small so that all strains are small.)\n\nNow if the neutral surface of the bent strip (the one that has no bending contribution) is forced to undergo an overall strain ε₀, then the strain at a distance y from the neutral surface is\n  ε = ε₀ + y/R.\nBecause the two metals would “like” to have thermal strains α₁ΔT (in the upper metal) and α₂ΔT (in the lower metal) the “mechanical” strains (deviations from the thermal expansion) become\n  for metal 1: ε₀ + (y₁)/R – α₁ΔT,\n  for metal 2: ε₀ + (y₂)/R – α₂ΔT.\nForce equilibrium (i.e. no net axial force) plus moment equilibrium (i.e. the “bending moment” integrated over the cross–section is zero in the absence of external loads) then give two equations. After integrating (taking into account that each metal has thickness x/2) one finds that\n  ε₀ = (α₁ + α₂)ΔT/2      (which is the overall (average) strain)\nand, more importantly,\n  1/R = 6(α₂ – α₁)ΔT/x.\n(There are many texts and notes on bimetallic strips where the above process is worked out in detail; see, for example, discussions of the Timoshenko bimetallic strip problem.)\n \n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3.

The treatment is fully quantum mechanical.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (a): High Temperature Limit (T → ∞)\n\nIn the high‐temperature limit, even for a quantum harmonic oscillator the spacing between energy levels becomes small compared to k_BT, so the classical equipartition theorem applies. In each normal mode there are two quadratic degrees of freedom (kinetic and potential energy). Thus, by equipartition, each degree of freedom contributes ½ k_BT to the energy; hence, each mode contributes k_BT. Taking the derivative with respect to T, the energy per mode yields a contribution to the specific heat of k_B. (Here we assume that the Boltzmann constant k_B is left explicit; alternatively, in “natural” units it could be set equal to unity.)\n\nSince there are N independent normal modes (one per degree of freedom), the total specific heat is\n\n  c_v = N k_B       (2)\n\nIf c_v is to be thought of as a specific heat per particle (or per unit length, with density normalized by N), then each particle gives k_B.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Low Temperature Limit (T → 0)\n\nAt low temperatures, only the low frequency (acoustic) modes are excited. To understand their contribution we examine the small‑n (long wavelength) behavior. For small x, recall that\n\n  cos x ≈ 1 – x²/2.\n\nSetting x = 2πn/N in Eq. (1) we have\n\n  ωₙ = ω̄ √[2(1 – cos(2πn/N))]\n    ≈ ω̄ √[2(1 – (1 – (2πn/N)²/2))]\n    = ω̄ √[(2πn/N)²]\n    = (2πω̄/N)|n|.\n\nThus, near n = 0 the dispersion relation is linear in |n|, which in turn means that if we define a continuous wave number k by k = (2πn/N) then\n\n  ω = v |k|,  where v = ω̄.\n\nThe density of states (per unit frequency) in one dimension for a linear (acoustic) dispersion is given by\n\n  ρ(ω) = (constant).\n\nMore explicitly, one has\n  dk/dω = 1/v  ⇒ ρ(ω) = (L/2π) (dk/dω) = L/(2πv),\nso that ρ(ω) ∝ 1/ω̄ (note that L is the total length and the density per particle is N/L, but the overall constant is not needed because the problem only asks for the exponents in the temperature and ω̄ scaling).\n\nThe specific heat for a harmonic oscillator is given quantum‐mechanically by\n\n  c_v(ω) = k_B (βħω)² exp(βħω) / [exp(βħω) – 1]²,\n\nwhere β = 1/(k_BT). At low T, only low ω modes (with ħω ≪ k_BT) contribute. In this regime one may expand the Bose–Einstein occupation factor leading to c_v(ω) ∼ k_B (βħω)². Putting the contributions of all modes together, the integrated specific heat is\n\n  c_v ∼ ∫₀ᴵ dω [ρ(ω)] k_B (βħω)² ∼ k_B β²ħ² ∫₀ᴵ dω ω² (1/ω̄),\nwhere I indicates an upper cutoff ~ k_BT/ħ. Changing variable to x = βħω gives\n\n  c_v ∼ k_B (1/ω̄) (k_BT/ħ)³ ∫ dx x² ∼ k_B (k_BT)³/(ħ³ω̄).\n\nSince k_B, ħ, and ω̄ are constants, this gives\n\n  c_v ∼ (constant) × ω̄^(–1) T³.\n\nHowever, this analysis would be completely proper if there were three dimensions (as in Debye’s T³ law in 3D). But note that we are considering a one-dimensional system. In fact, the proper low‐temperature behavior for acoustic excitations in d dimensions is governed by the Debye law\n\n  c_v ∼ Tᵈ.\n\nThus for d = 1 we have\n\n  c_v ∼ T.\n\nLet’s reconcile the two ways. In one dimension the density of states for a linear dispersion is constant (not ∝ ω²). More carefully, using\n\n  ρ(ω) dω ∼ dω/ω̄     (because ω = v|k| and dk = dω/v),\nthe thermal energy per mode (excluding the zero point energy) is\n\n  E(ω) = ħω/(exp(βħω) – 1).\n\nThen\n\n  U ∼ ∫₀ᴵ dω (1/ω̄) [ħω/(exp(βħω) – 1)].\n\nChanging variable x = βħω yields\n\n  U ∼ (1/ω̄) (1/(βħ)²) ∫₀∞ dx x/(exp(x) – 1).\nThe integral is a finite constant. Thus U ∼ T² and hence\n\n  c_v = dU/dT ∼ T.\n\nIt now becomes clear that the correct low-T behavior is proportional to T (i.e. a linear T-dependence) and there is one power of ω̄ in the denominator (from ρ(ω)).

In brief, one may say that\n\n (a) the best “laboratory” limits on a putative thermal neutrino gas come not from any direct detection of relic neutrinos (which are extremely feeble) but from precision measurements of neutrino “kinematics” – that is, from beta‐decay endpoint measurements (e.g. in tritium decay experiments such as those at Mainz and Troitsk and the forthcoming KATRIN experiment) as well as from neutrino oscillation studies. These experiments are sensitive to the (sub–eV) neutrino masses. Since the mean kinetic energy of a thermal gas is of order kBT, any neutrino “bath” that had a temperature of even an eV (1 eV ≃ 1.16×10^4 K) would be many orders of magnitude “hotter” than the expected relic neutrinos. In effect, the laboratory limits tell us that any ambient neutrino gas must have characteristic energies ≲ a few eV – and in fact, when one does the detailed analysis one is led to conclude that if a relic neutrino bath exists its “temperature” (more precisely, the spread of neutrino energies) is extremely low, essentially in the (sub–meV) regime. (Of course, note that these experiments really constrain the (small) neutrino mass rather than an ambient “temperature” per se; yet were there an “extra” thermal neutrino population with T ≫ 10^–3 eV we would see it in these processes.)\n\n (b) Now, the well‐known 3 K cosmic microwave background (CMB) has an energy density\n  ργ = (π^2/15)T_γ^4.\nIt turns out that at 3 K this radiation makes up only about 10^–6 of the energy density needed to “close” the Universe. (That is, the density parameter in radiation is very small today.) Now suppose that—even apart from the CMB—we had a relic neutrino gas with temperature T_ν. (For relativistic species the energy density goes roughly as ρ ∝ T^4.) If we “allow” the neutrinos to have a temperature that is higher than the standard prediction, then their energy density would be\n\n  ρ_ν = (7/8)(π^2/15)·N_eff · T_ν^4,\n       where N_eff is the effective number of neutrino species (N_eff ≃ 3). \n\nComparing to the photon energy density, one finds\n\n  ρ_ν/ρ_γ = (7/8)·N_eff · (T_ν/T_γ)^4.\nIf we demanded that ρ_ν not exceed the closure density (and in fact, if one “maximally” allowed neutrinos to be important we would—as an order‐of‐magnitude—allow ρ_ν to be roughly the critical density, i.e. roughly 10^6 times larger than ρ_γ), then roughly one would require\n\n  (7/8)·3· (T_ν/T_γ)^4 ≲ 10^6.\nNumerically, (7/8)·3 ≃ 2.6, so\n  (T_ν/T_γ)^4 ≲ 10^6 / 2.6 ≃ 3.8×10^5,\nor\n  T_ν/T_γ ≲ (3.8×10^5)^(1/4) ≃ 25.\nSince T_γ ≃ 3 K, this tells us that even under the extreme (and already excluded) possibility that the relic neutrinos “close” the Universe, their temperature can be no more than roughly 25×3 K ≃ 75 K – that is, one obtains an order‐of–magnitude bound of T_ν ≲ 10^2 K. (A more careful treatment including all factors will lead to a similar bound.) \n\n (c) In the standard hot‐big–bang picture the neutrinos decouple from the other particles when they are ultra–relativistic. Soon after decoupling the e^+e^– pairs annihilate, dumping their entropy into the photons alone. This “reheats” the photon bath relative to the neutrinos. A careful accounting shows that the neutrino temperature today is given by\n\n  T_ν = (4/11)^(1/3) T_γ.\nTaking T_γ ≃ 3 K we obtain\n  T_ν ≃ (4/11)^(1/3)×3 K ≃ 1.95 K.\nThat is, one expects the cosmic neutrino background to have a temperature of order 2 K.\n\nLet us summarize our answers in boxed form:\n\n (a) Laboratory experiments—namely precision beta–decay (and related neutrino‐oscillation) measurements—are sensitive to neutrino masses of order a few eV. These experiments imply that any extra thermal neutrinos must have typical energies (kBT) ≪ 1 eV (i.e. their “temperature” is extremely low).\n (b) Requiring that the neutrino energy density not exceed the critical density (given that the photon energy density at 3 K is only about 10^–6 of that value) forces an upper bound on any putative neutrino temperature of order T_ν ≲ 10^2 K.\n (c) In the standard big–bang cosmology the relic neutrinos have T_ν = (4/11)^(1/3)T_γ ≃ 2 K.\n\nThus, the final answers are\n\n  (a) Best laboratory limits (from tritium beta–decay and oscillation measurements) constrain neutrino energies to the eV (or sub–eV) scale, implying any ambient neutrino “bath” must be very cold.\n  (b) By closure–density arguments one must have T_ν ≲ O(10^2 K).\n  (c) In the standard picture T_ν = (4/11)^(1/3) T_γ ≃ 2 K.\n\nNow we write the final answers in our boxed answer format:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\;&\\text{Precision beta–decay (and oscillation) experiments limit any extra thermal neutrino energies to } \\lesssim \\text{ a few eV, i.e. they must be very “cold” (sub–meV thermal energies).}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\;&\\text{Since the 3K photon gas is about }10^{-6}\\text{ of closure, a neutrino bath that nearly closes the Universe can have } T_\\nu \\lesssim 10^2\\,\\text{K}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\;&\\text{In the standard big–bang, }T_\\nu=\\Bigl(\\frac{4}{11}\\Bigr)^{1/3}T_\\gamma\\approx2\\,\\text{K}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\;&\\text{Precision beta–decay (and oscillation) experiments limit any extra thermal neutrino energies to } \\lesssim \\text{ a few eV, i.e. they must be very “cold” (sub–meV thermal energies).}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\;&\\text{Since the 3K photon gas is about }10^{-6}\\text{ of closure, a neutrino bath that nearly closes the Universe can have } T_\\nu \\lesssim 10^2\\,\\text{K}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\;&\\text{In the standard big–bang, }T_\\nu=\\Bigl(\\frac{4}{11}\\Bigr)^{1/3}T_\\gamma\\approx2\\,\\text{K}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\;&\\text{Precision beta–decay (and oscillation) experiments limit any extra thermal neutrino energies to } \\lesssim \\text{ a few eV, i.e. they must be very “cold” (sub–meV thermal energies).}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\;&\\text{Since the 3K photon gas is about }10^{-6}\\text{ of closure, a neutrino bath that nearly closes the Universe can have } T_\\nu \\lesssim 10^2\\,\\text{K}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\;&\\text{In the standard big–bang, }T_\\nu=\\Bigl(\\frac{4}{11}\\Bigr)^{1/3}T_\\gamma\\approx2\\,\\text{K}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "T < 10^6 \\text{ K}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\;&\\text{Precision beta–decay (and oscillation) experiments limit any extra thermal neutrino energies to } \\lesssim \\text{ a few eV, i.e. they must be very “cold” (sub–meV thermal energies).}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\;&\\text{Since the 3K photon gas is about }10^{-6}\\text{ of closure, a neutrino bath that nearly closes the Universe can have } T_\\nu \\lesssim 10^2\\,\\text{K}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\;&\\text{In the standard big–bang, }T_\\nu=\\Bigl(\\frac{4}{11}\\Bigr)^{1/3}T_\\gamma\\approx2\\,\\text{K}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "T_{\\nu} \\leq 0.1 \\text{ K}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\;&\\text{Precision beta–decay (and oscillation) experiments limit any extra thermal neutrino energies to } \\lesssim \\text{ a few eV, i.e. they must be very “cold” (sub–meV thermal energies).}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\;&\\text{Since the 3K photon gas is about }10^{-6}\\text{ of closure, a neutrino bath that nearly closes the Universe can have } T_\\nu \\lesssim 10^2\\,\\text{K}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\;&\\text{In the standard big–bang, }T_\\nu=\\Bigl(\\frac{4}{11}\\Bigr)^{1/3}T_\\gamma\\approx2\\,\\text{K}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "T_{\\nu} < 3 \\text{ K}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "statistics/2-152", "solution": "We can explain the long electron–electron collision mean free path by noting that, although the electrons in a metal are densely packed, several factors combine to drastically reduce the effective scattering rate among them:\n\n1. Fermi Surface and Pauli Blocking:  \n In a metal at low temperatures, most electrons occupy states in the Fermi sea, and only those with energies within ~k₍B₎T of the Fermi energy can participate in scattering (i.e., be excited to an unoccupied state). The Pauli exclusion principle implies that many final states are already occupied, thus “blocking” many scattering processes. This restricted phase space means that even though electrons are close together spatially, the likelihood that two electrons will have mutually available states for scattering is low.\n\n2. Screening of the Coulomb Interaction:  \n Even though the fundamental electron–electron interaction is the long‐range Coulomb interaction, in a metal the bare Coulomb interaction is strongly screened by the sea of conduction electrons. This screening reduces the effective interaction strength at distances beyond the screening length, leading to a weaker scattering amplitude. As a consequence, electrons do not interact as strongly with one another as might be expected from the unscreened Coulomb potential.\n\n3. Conservation Laws:  \n Energy and momentum must be conserved in each collision. These conservation laws can further restrict the number of allowed scattering processes, particularly in the degenerate electron gas where the electrons are confined near the Fermi surface. The combined constraints of momentum, energy conservation, and Pauli exclusion significantly reduce the effective scattering rate.\n\nQualitative Temperature Dependence:\n\nAt finite temperatures, only the electrons within an energy range ~k₍B₎T around the Fermi energy can participate in scattering, so the number of available electrons (and correspondingly the number of available final states) is proportional to T. More quantitatively, Fermi liquid theory tells us that the electron–electron scattering rate (and hence the inverse of the lifetime) scales as (k₍B₎T/E_F)², provided T ≪ E_F. Since the mean free path is inversely related to the scattering rate, this means that the electron–electron collision mean free path increases as temperature decreases and, roughly, the scattering rate (1/τ₍ee₎) scales as T². Thus, at lower temperatures, electron–electron scattering becomes even less frequent, leading to longer mean free paths.\n\nFinal Answer in Summary:\n\nEven though the electrons in a metal are spaced closely (1–3 Å apart), the electron–electron collision mean free path is long (∼10⁴ Å) because (i) the Pauli exclusion principle restricts the phase space available for scattering by allowing only electrons within ∼k₍B₎T of the Fermi level to scatter, (ii) screening of the Coulomb interaction reduces the effective scattering strength, and (iii) energy and momentum conservation further limit the number of allowed collisions. This leads to a scattering rate that, according to Fermi liquid theory, varies as T², so that at lower temperatures, the mean free path increases significantly.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{The long electron–electron mean free path arises because:} \\\\\n&\\quad \\bullet\\, \\text{Only electrons within ~k}_{B}\\text{T of } E_F \\text{ can scatter (due to Pauli blocking).} \\\\\n&\\quad \\bullet\\, \\text{Screening reduces the effective Coulomb interaction.} \\\\\n&\\quad \\bullet\\, \\text{Conservation laws (energy, momentum) further restrict scattering.} \\\\\n&\\text{Thus, the scattering rate ~ (T/E}_F)^2, leading to a mean free path that grows as } 1/T^2.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{The long electron–electron mean free path arises because:} \\\\\n&\\quad \\bullet\\, \\text{Only electrons within ~k}_{B}\\text{T of } E_F \\text{ can scatter (due to Pauli blocking).} \\\\\n&\\quad \\bullet\\, \\text{Screening reduces the effective Coulomb interaction.} \\\\\n&\\quad \\bullet\\, \\text{Conservation laws (energy, momentum) further restrict scattering.} \\\\\n&\\text{Thus, the scattering rate ~ (T/E}_F)^2, leading to a mean free path that grows as"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{The long electron–electron mean free path arises because:} \\\\\n&\\quad \\bullet\\, \\text{Only electrons within ~k}_{B}\\text{T of } E_F \\text{ can scatter (due to Pauli blocking).} \\\\\n&\\quad \\bullet\\, \\text{Screening reduces the effective Coulomb interaction.} \\\\\n&\\quad \\bullet\\, \\text{Conservation laws (energy, momentum) further restrict scattering.} \\\\\n&\\text{Thus, the scattering rate ~ (T/E}_F)^2, leading to a mean free path that grows as", "expr2": "\\lambda_{ee} \\propto \\frac{1}{T}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "statistics/1-35", "solution": "We start with two identical bodies, each having internal energy U = N C T, where N and C are the same for both. Their initial temperatures are T₁ and T₂. In order to extract the maximum work via a reversible (Carnot) process, we must ensure that the total entropy change of the universe is zero. At the end of the process, both bodies reach a common temperature T_f.\n\nStep 1. Write the entropy change for each body.\n\nFor a body with heat capacity NC (assumed constant), the change in entropy when its temperature changes from Tᵢ to T_f is given by\n\n  ΔS = N C ln(T_f/Tᵢ).\n\nFor the first body cooling from T₁ to T_f, the entropy change is\n  ΔS₁ = N C ln(T_f/T₁).\n\nFor the second body warming from T₂ to T_f, the entropy change is\n  ΔS₂ = N C ln(T_f/T₂).\n\nStep 2. Set the total entropy change to zero.\n\nSince the extraction process is reversible, the sum of the entropy changes must be zero:\n  ΔS₁ + ΔS₂ = 0,\nwhich implies\n  N C ln(T_f/T₁) + N C ln(T_f/T₂) = 0.\n\nCombining the logarithms:\n  N C ln [(T_f/T₁)(T_f/T₂)] = N C ln (T_f²/(T₁T₂)) = 0.\n\nThus,\n  ln (T_f²/(T₁T₂)) = 0  ⟹  T_f²/(T₁T₂) = 1.\n\nSo,\n  T_f² = T₁T₂  ⟹  T_f = √(T₁T₂).\n\nStep 3.

{"id": "statistics/2-2", "solution": "We wish to understand how the “color‐composition” changes over time when bacteria occasionally reproduce but the total number is kept fixed by “predation”. In our setting the two “alleles” (red and green markers) are completely neutral (apart from the colors) so that there is no difference in reproduction. (In part (c) we break this neutrality slightly.) In effect, one has a fixed‐size population (10,000 bacteria) in which at every “time‐step” one bacterium reproduces (splitting into two of its own type) and one bacterium is removed (killed by the predator). (The predator does its choice at random.) This is exactly the structure of the celebrated Moran process in population genetics.\n\nBelow we explain step‐by‐step the answers.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. (The Neutral Case) What is the equilibrium (long‐time) distribution?\n\nIn a finite neutral Moran process (i.e. one with no mutation or migration) the only absorbing states are those in which the entire population is fixed for one type. Starting with 5,000 red and 5,000 green bacteria the process then “wanders” (by random genetic drift) until eventually one of the two types is eliminated. Thus, after a “very long time” the only possible outcomes are\n\n • all bacteria are red (i.e. 10,000 red, 0 green) or\n • all bacteria are green (i.e. 0 red, 10,000 green).\n\nSince every reproduction–death event is completely “fair” (no bias) the probability that red eventually fixes is just its initial frequency, namely 5000/10000 = 1/2 (and green fixes with probability 1/2).\n\nThus, (a) in the neutral case the distribution of the number of red bacteria is given by\n  P{red = 10,000} = 1/2  and  P{red = 0} = 1/2,\nwith all intermediate states having probability 0 in the long‐time limit.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. (Time to fixation when neutral)\n\nNext, we ask: how long will one have to “wait” (i.e. how many reproduction–death events must occur) before the system is essentially fixed in one of the two states?\n\nThe Moran process is well‐studied. For a neutral process (i.e. no selection), a standard result for the mean time (in number of events) to absorption is\n\n  Tᵢ = –2N [(i/N) ln(i/N) + (1 – i/N) ln(1 – i/N)]\n     (see, e.g., Ewens, “Mathematical Population Genetics”)\n\nHere N = 10,000 and the initial number of red is i = 5000, so that i/N = 0.5. Then\n  T₅₀₀₀ = –2·10,000 [0.5 ln(0.5) + 0.5 ln(0.5)]\n        = –20,000 [ln(0.5)]\n        = 20,000 · ln2    (since ln(0.5) = –ln2).\n\nNumerically, \n  20,000 · ln2 ≈ 20,000 × 0.693 ≈ 13,860 hours.\n\nSince in our setting each update occurs every hour, the expected time to fixation is about 13,860 hours – which is roughly 575–600 days (roughly a year and a half).\n\nThus, (b) you must wait on the order of 14,000 hours (nearly 600 days) before the colony almost surely consists of only one color.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. (The Slightly Biased Case)\n\nNow, suppose the predator has a 1% preference for red bacteria. (In words, the predator is 1% more likely to eat a red bacterium than a green one.)\n\nLet us be precise. At every time‐step the following occurs:\n (1) A bacterium is chosen uniformly at random to reproduce.\n (2) One bacterium is chosen to be eaten. In the unbiased case every bacterium had the same chance (1/10,000) of being eaten. Now, however, if there are x red bacteria and 10,000 – x green bacteria, we assume that each red bacterium has weight 1.01 and each green bacterium weight 1, so that the total weight is\n\n  W = 1.01·x + 1·(10,000 – x).\n\nThus the probability that a red bacterium is eaten is\n\n  P(red eaten) = (1.01·x) / (10,000 + 0.01·x).\n\nLikewise, the probability that a green bacterium is eaten is\n\n  P(green eaten) = (10,000 – x) / (10,000 + 0.01·x).\n\nNow, let us describe the possible “steps” that change the number x of red bacteria. (Recall that if a red bacterium reproduces and a green dies, then x increases by 1; if a green reproduces and a red dies, then x decreases by 1; if both reproduction and death occur in the same color then x doesn’t change.)\n\nThe probability that x increases by 1 is:\n  P(x → x + 1) = (chance a red reproduces) × (chance a green is eaten)\n         = (x/10,000) · ((10,000 – x)/(10,000 + 0.01·x)).\n\nSimilarly, the probability that x decreases by 1 is:\n  P(x → x – 1) = (chance a green reproduces) × (chance a red is eaten)\n         = ((10,000 – x)/10,000) · ((1.01·x)/(10,000 + 0.01·x)).\n\nThus, the “drift” (or mean change) per time‐step is proportional to\n\n  Δx ∝ (x(10,000 – x)) [1 – 1.01] = –0.01 · x(10,000 – x),\nindicating that red bacteria suffer a disadvantage equivalent to a selection coefficient of roughly 1%.\n\nThe standard result for the fixation probability u(i) of a deleterious allele in a Moran process (starting with i individuals in a total population of size N) is\n\n  u(i) = (1 – e^(–s·i)) / (1 – e^(–s·N))\n        (for any s, with s > 0 meaning an advantage).\n\nHere red is at a disadvantage, so we take s = 0.01 but note that its “advantage” is –s. (One may simply plug in –0.01 for s into the above formula.) Starting from i = 5000,\n  u(5000) = (1 – e^(+0.01·5000))/(1 – e^(+0.01·10000)) \n        = (1 – e^(50))/(1 – e^(100)).\n\nNow, e^(50) and e^(100) are enormous numbers. In fact, both numerator and denominator are negative (since 1 – e^(50) < 0, etc.) but the ratio is positive. For large numbers, we can “invert” the formula to see that this ratio is extremely small – roughly of order e^(-50) ≈ 2×10^(–22). In words, starting at a 50–50 mix, almost certainly eventually the red bacteria will be eliminated.\n\nThe selection (bias) also speeds up the process. In a Moran process with selection the typical time scale is shorter than in the neutral case. Rough estimates (or standard theory) tell us that the typical time scale for fixation under selection is of order\n\n  T ~ (ln N)/|s|.\n\nFor N = 10,000 and |s| = 0.01 this gives\n\n  T ~ (ln 10,000)/0.01 ≈ (9.21)/(0.01) ≈ 921 hours,\n\nwhich is roughly 38 days. (The exact factor depends on the precise details of the process, but this is the correct order‐of‐magnitude.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) In the unbiased (“neutral”) case the only absorbing states are 0 red (all green) and 10,000 red (all red). Because the process is neutral, the probability of each is given by the initial frequency; that is, there is a 50% chance that eventually all bacteria are red and a 50% chance they are all green.\n\n(b) In the neutral case the expected time until one color “fixes” is roughly 2N ln2 ≈ 14,000 hours (or about 600 days).\n\n(c) With a 1% bias (red bacteria are 1% more likely to be eaten) the process is no longer neutral. In that case red almost surely eventually goes extinct (with a fixation probability of roughly 2×10^(–22)) and the time to fixation is much shorter – approximately (ln 10,000)/0.01 ≈ 921 hours (around 38 days).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal boxed answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad&\\text{In the neutral case, eventually }P\\{R=0\\}=0.5\\text{ and }P\\{R=10,\\!000\\}=0.5,\\,P\\{R=k\\}=0\\text{ for }0<k<10,\\!000.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad&\\text{The mean time to fixation is about }2\\cdot10,\\!000\\ln2\\approx14,\\!000\\text{ hours (nearly 600 days).}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad&\\text{If the predator has a 1\\% preference for red, red’s effective fitness is reduced by about 1\\%;}\\\\\n&\\text{thus, almost surely (with probability } \\sim1\\text{) red is eliminated, and the mean time to fixation}\\\\\n&\\text{drops to roughly } \\ln(10,\\!000)/0.01\\approx920\\text{ hours (about 38 days).}\n\\end{aligned}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad&\\text{In the neutral case, eventually }P\\{R=0\\}=0.5\\text{ and }P\\{R=10,\\!000\\}=0.5,\\,P\\{R=k\\}=0\\text{ for }0<k<10,\\!000.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad&\\text{The mean time to fixation is about }2\\cdot10,\\!000\\ln2\\approx14,\\!000\\text{ hours (nearly 600 days).}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad&\\text{If the predator has a 1\\% preference for red, red’s effective fitness is reduced by about 1\\%;}\\\\\n&\\text{thus, almost surely (with probability } \\sim1\\text{) red is eliminated, and the mean time to fixation}\\\\\n&\\text{drops to roughly } \\ln(10,\\!000)/0.01\\approx920\\text{ hours (about 38 days).}\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad&\\text{In the neutral case, eventually }P\\{R=0\\}=0.5\\text{ and }P\\{R=10,\\!000\\}=0.5,\\,P\\{R=k\\}=0\\text{ for }0<k<10,\\!000.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad&\\text{The mean time to fixation is about }2\\cdot10,\\!000\\ln2\\approx14,\\!000\\text{ hours (nearly 600 days).}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad&\\text{If the predator has a 1\\% preference for red, red’s effective fitness is reduced by about 1\\%;}\\\\\n&\\text{thus, almost surely (with probability } \\sim1\\text{) red is eliminated, and the mean time to fixation}\\\\\n&\\text{drops to roughly } \\ln(10,\\!000)/0.01\\approx920\\text{ hours (about 38 days).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{1}{2^n} \\cdot \\frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad&\\text{In the neutral case, eventually }P\\{R=0\\}=0.5\\text{ and }P\\{R=10,\\!000\\}=0.5,\\,P\\{R=k\\}=0\\text{ for }0<k<10,\\!000.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad&\\text{The mean time to fixation is about }2\\cdot10,\\!000\\ln2\\approx14,\\!000\\text{ hours (nearly 600 days).}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad&\\text{If the predator has a 1\\% preference for red, red’s effective fitness is reduced by about 1\\%;}\\\\\n&\\text{thus, almost surely (with probability } \\sim1\\text{) red is eliminated, and the mean time to fixation}\\\\\n&\\text{drops to roughly } \\ln(10,\\!000)/0.01\\approx920\\text{ hours (about 38 days).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "6 \\text{ to } 7 \\text{ hours}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad&\\text{In the neutral case, eventually }P\\{R=0\\}=0.5\\text{ and }P\\{R=10,\\!000\\}=0.5,\\,P\\{R=k\\}=0\\text{ for }0<k<10,\\!000.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad&\\text{The mean time to fixation is about }2\\cdot10,\\!000\\ln2\\approx14,\\!000\\text{ hours (nearly 600 days).}\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad&\\text{If the predator has a 1\\% preference for red, red’s effective fitness is reduced by about 1\\%;}\\\\\n&\\text{thus, almost surely (with probability } \\sim1\\text{) red is eliminated, and the mean time to fixation}\\\\\n&\\text{drops to roughly } \\ln(10,\\!000)/0.01\\approx920\\text{ hours (about 38 days).}\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + p\\right)^m \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - p\\right)^{n-m}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "statistics/1-32", "solution": "The Carnot cycle is an idealized thermodynamic cycle that represents the most efficient engine possible operating between two heat reservoirs. It consists of four reversible processes:\n\n1. Isothermal Expansion (at temperature Tₕ): The system expands while absorbing heat Qₕ from a high-temperature reservoir. During this step, the temperature remains constant and the system does work on the surroundings.\n2. Adiabatic Expansion: The system continues to expand without any heat exchange (Q = 0), causing its temperature to drop from Tₕ to T𝒸.\n3. Isothermal Compression (at temperature T𝒸): The system is compressed while releasing heat Q𝒸 to a low-temperature reservoir. The temperature remains constant during this compression.\n4. Adiabatic Compression: The system is compressed further without heat exchange, raising its temperature from T𝒸 back to Tₕ.\n\nLet’s break down these steps, illustrate them on both pV and ST diagrams, and then derive the efficiency.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 1. Illustrating the Cycle\n\nA. pV Diagram\n\nOn a pressure–volume (pV) diagram, the Carnot cycle appears as a closed loop consisting of:\n\n• Process AB (Isothermal Expansion at Tₕ): The curve represents an isotherm; as the system expands (increase in volume), the pressure decreases.\n• Process BC (Adiabatic Expansion): The curve drops more steeply because no heat is exchanged. Here the system’s temperature drops from Tₕ to T𝒸.\n• Process CD (Isothermal Compression at T𝒸): This is another isotherm where volume decreases; the pressure increases as the system rejects heat.\n• Process DA (Adiabatic Compression): The process takes the system back to the original state (Tₕ) with no heat exchange. The pressure increases further while the volume decreases.\n\nImagine the loop starting at point A, moving along AB (isotherm at Tₕ), then BC (adiabat), then CD (isotherm at T𝒸), and then DA (adiabat) back to A.\n\nB. ST Diagram\n\nThe entropy–temperature (ST) diagram is particularly useful for reversible cycles:\n \n• For the isothermal processes, temperature is constant while entropy changes. \n  - During AB, the system absorbs heat Qₕ, so the entropy increases by ΔS = Qₕ/Tₕ.\n  - During CD, the system rejects heat Q𝒸, so the entropy decreases by ΔS = Q𝒸/T𝒸.\n• For the adiabatic processes (BC and DA), no heat is exchanged, so the entropy remains constant.\n\nThus, the ST diagram shows two horizontal lines corresponding to the isothermal steps (one at Tₕ with an area representing Qₕ, and one at T𝒸 representing Q𝒸) connected by vertical lines (adiabats) where entropy is unchanged.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 2. Deriving the Efficiency\n\nThe efficiency (η) of any engine is given by the net work output divided by the heat input at the high temperature:\n\n  η = 1 – (Q𝒸 / Qₕ).\n\nFor the Carnot cycle, the only heat exchanges occur during the isothermal steps.\n\n• During the isothermal expansion (at Tₕ):\n  Qₕ = Tₕ ΔS,\n  where ΔS is the change in entropy during expansion.\n\n• During the isothermal compression (at T𝒸):\n  Q𝒸 = T𝒸 ΔS,\n  (here ΔS is the same magnitude, but the heat is rejected, so sometimes it is denoted with a negative sign—the absolute values are used in efficiency calculations).\n\nThus, substituting these into the efficiency formula:\n\n  η = 1 – (T𝒸 ΔS / Tₕ ΔS) = 1 – (T𝒸 / Tₕ).\n\nThis result shows that the efficiency of a Carnot engine depends solely on the temperatures of the high and low reservoirs.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer\n\nThe Carnot cycle is an idealized cycle composed of two isothermal and two adiabatic processes. On a pV diagram, it appears as a closed loop with isothermal curves at high and low temperatures connected by adiabatic curves. On an ST diagram, it appears as a horizontal expansion (increase in entropy) at Tₕ, a vertical (adiabatic) drop, a horizontal compression (decrease in entropy) at T𝒸, and another vertical (adiabatic) rise. The efficiency of a Carnot engine operating between a high temperature Tₕ and a low temperature T𝒸 is derived as:\n\n  η = 1 – (T𝒸 / Tₕ).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\eta = 1 -\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\eta = 1 -\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\eta = 1 -\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}", "expr2": "\\eta = 1 - \\frac{T_2}{T_1}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Count the number of paths (outcomes) leading to these allowed displacements\n\nTotal outcomes over 3 steps = 4^3 = 64.\n\nWe now count the number of distinct 3‐step paths that yield each allowed endpoint.\n\na. Paths yielding (0, 1)\n\nHow can we get (0, 1)? We need the y–coordinate to be +1 and the x–coordinate to be 0.\n Notice that 0 can only be obtained as a sum when there are two moves in that coordinate with one step east and one west. So the 0 in x forces the scenario where there are 2 moves in x (one east and one west) and 1 move in y. (It is impossible to have a net 0 from a single move.)\n – Choose 2 out of the 3 steps to be the x–moves: this can be done in C(3,2) = 3 ways.\n – For the 2 x–moves, to have net 0 we must have one east and one west. There are 2 orders in which this can happen.\n – The one y–move (which happens in the remaining step) must be north (to give y = +1). There is only 1 possibility.\nThus the number of paths giving (0, 1) is: 3 × 2 × 1 = 6.\n\nb. Similarly, (0, –1) is obtained by the same reasoning (with the y–move being south): 6 paths.\n\nc. For (1, 0)\n\nHere we need x = +1 and y = 0. To have y = 0, we must have 2 y–moves that cancel (one north and one south), so the 2 y–moves yield net 0.\n – Choose 1 out of 3 steps to be the x–move: C(3,1) = 3 ways.\n – The single x–move must be east (to get +1): 1 possibility.\n – The 2 y–moves must consist of one north and one south. There are 2 orders for these moves.\nThus the number of paths for (1, 0) is: 3 × 1 × 2 = 6.\n\nd. Likewise, (–1, 0) has 6 paths.\n\nTotal allowed paths = 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24.\n\nStep 6. Compute the probability\n\nProbability = (Number of allowed outcomes) / (Total outcomes) = 24 / 64 = 3/8.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}\\]", "final_answers": ["\\frac{3}{8}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{3}{8}", "expr2": "\\frac{9}{16}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "3/8", "expr2": "9/16"}, "sympy_result": false, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "statistics/2-15", "solution": "We will address each part in turn.\n\n────────────────────────\nStep (a): Fundamental Assumptions\n\n• Maxwell–Boltzmann (MB) statistics assumes that the particles are classical and – even if they may be identical in mass and charge – they are taken as distinguishable. No restrictions are imposed on the number of particles per quantum state. In MB theory the probability of finding a particle in a state of energy E is proportional to exp(–E/kT) and there is no account taken of quantum exchange effects.\n\n• Fermi–Dirac (FD) statistics is designed for quantum particles of half–integer spin (fermions) that obey the Pauli exclusion principle; that is, no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. Accordingly, the FD factor for the occupation of an energy level is 1/(e^( (E–μ)/kT ) + 1). It is based on the indistinguishability of particles and the antisymmetrization of their many–body wavefunctions.\n\n────────────────────────\nStep (b): Energy Distribution Plots\n\nFor a system of free particles the MB energy distribution goes as f_MB(E) ∝ exp(–E/kT). Consider two temperatures: at a higher temperature the decay with energy is slower (i.e. the distribution is broader) compared with the lower temperature.\n\nFor FD statistics the energy distribution is given roughly by:\n  f_FD(E)= 1/ (e^( (E–μ)/kT) + 1).\nAt absolute zero the FD distribution is a step function (with a sharp cutoff at the Fermi energy, μ = E_F). At finite temperatures the step is smeared over an energy range ~ kT. Thus, in a rough sketch:\n\n1. MB curves: Plot two curves that fall exponentially. The higher–temperature MB curve falls off more slowly (i.e. is “stretched out” to higher energies) than the lower–temperature one.\n2. FD curves: At a lower temperature the FD curve is nearly a perfect step function (f ≈1 for E < E_F and nearly zero for E > E_F). At a higher temperature the curve shows a softening of the step – a smoother transition around E_F.\n\nWhen indicating which curve corresponds to the higher temperature, keep in mind that for MB the higher T curve is broader. For FD, the higher temperature curve shows a greater “rounding” of the step in the transition region near the Fermi energy.\n\n────────────────────────\nStep (c): Specific Heat of Metals\n\nThe classical prediction using MB statistics leads to a specific heat contribution from electrons that is far too large compared with experimental measurements. In the MB picture nearly all electrons can be thermally excited. However, experiments show that the electronic contribution to the specific heat of metals is only a small fraction of that predicted by MB statistics.\n\nFD statistics resolves this discrepancy. Since fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, at low temperatures only electrons within an energy band of order kT (around the Fermi energy) are available for excitation. The vast majority of electrons are “frozen” into filled states and do not contribute to the specific heat. Therefore, the FD theory naturally predicts a much smaller electronic specific heat, in agreement with experiment.\n\n────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\textbf{(a)}\\quad & \\text{MB statistics assumes classical, distinguishable particles with no restrictions on state occupancy,} \\\\\n& \\text{leading to an exponential factor, } e^{-E/kT}. \\ \\text{In contrast, FD statistics applies to indistinguishable fermions } \\\\\n& \\text{which obey the Pauli exclusion principle (each state may be occupied by at most one particle), giving} \\\\\n& \\text{an occupancy factor of } \\frac{1}{e^{(E-\\mu)/kT}+1}. \\\\[1mm]\n\\textbf{(b)}\\quad & \\text{For MB, the energy distribution curves (∝} \\, e^{-E/kT}\\text{) at higher T are broader (i.e. decay slower) than at lower T.} \\\\\n& \\text{For FD, at very low T the distribution is a near step function (1 for } E<E_F \\text{ and 0 for } E>E_F\\text{),} \\\\\n& \\text{while at higher T the step is smeared out.

{"id": "statistics/1-154", "solution": "We begin by noting that the formation of ice requires the removal of latent heat.

When a thin slice of ice of thickness dh forms over a time dt, the energy required per unit area is (L/V) dh.\n\nSince the rate at which latent heat is “removed” (by conduction) must balance the latent heat needed to freeze an incremental thickness, we equate the conduction flux to the energy rate used for freezing:\n\n  Λ (ΔT / h) = (L/V) (dh/dt)\n\nSolve for dh/dt:\n\n  dh/dt = [Λ ΔT / h] / (L/V) = (Λ ΔT) / ((L/V) h)\n\nSeparate variables:\n\n  h dh = (Λ ΔT/(L/V)) dt\n\nIntegrate both sides; taking h = 0 at t = 0:\n\n  ∫₀^(h(t)) h dh = ∫₀^(t) (Λ ΔT/(L/V)) dt\n\nThe integration yields:\n\n  ½ [h(t)]² = (Λ ΔT/(L/V)) t\n\nSolve for h(t):\n\n  h(t) = √[ (2 Λ ΔT t)/(L/V) ]\n\nThus, the thickness of the ice as a function of time is given by:\n\n  h(t) = √[ (2 Λ ΔT t)/(L/V) ]\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n  \\[\\boxed{h(t) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\Lambda \\Delta T\\, t}{L/V}}}\\]", "final_answers": ["h(t) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\Lambda \\Delta T\\, t}{L/V}}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "h(t) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\Lambda \\Delta T\\, t}{L/V}}", "expr2": "h(t) = \\left[ \\frac{2 \\Lambda \\Delta T t}{(L/V)} \\right]^{1/2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "sqrt(2)*sqrt(Delta*Lambda*T*V*t/L)", "expr2": "sqrt(2)*sqrt(Delta*Lambda*T*V*t/L)"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

(In many texts the two‐level system is taken as “quantum” with non‐degenerate levels but the occupation factors are still given by Boltzmann factors. In any event, we assume here that the probabilities of occupation are proportional to e^(–βE) with β = 1/(kT).) For convenience it is sometimes useful to define\n\n  Δ = E₁ – E₀   (with Δ > 0)\n\nand even to set the zero of energy at E₀, so that E₀ = 0 and E₁ = Δ.

In particular, the logarithm of the x-part of the partition function varies as (1/α)lnT. Hence, differentiating with respect to T gives an average potential energy of\n  ⟨V⟩ = (1/α) k_B T.\nThus, the total average energy per particle is\n  ⟨E⟩ = (1/2 + 1/α) k_B T.\nDifferentiating with respect to T gives the heat capacity per particle:\n  C_V = d⟨E⟩/dT = (1/2 + 1/α) k_B.\n\nNow we apply this to our two cases.\n\nCase (a): Restoring Force ∝ x\n\nFor a force proportional to x, the potential must be quadratic in x. That is, we write\n  V(x)= (1/2) k x²,\nwhich corresponds to α = 2 (with C = k/2).\n\nSubstituting α = 2 into our formula gives:\n  ⟨E⟩ = (1/2 + 1/2) k_B T = k_B T,\nand thus,\n  C_V = k_B   (per particle).\nFor N particles, the total heat capacity is:\n  C_V = N k_B.\n\nCase (b): Restoring Force ∝ x³\n\nA force proportional to x³ means that\n  F(x) = -a x³   (with some constant a).\nSince force is the negative derivative of the potential:\n  F(x) = -dV/dx,\nintegrating gives:\n  V(x) = (a/4)x⁴   (ignoring an integration constant).\nThis is of the form V(x) = Cx⁴ with α = 4 (and C = a/4).\n\nUsing our general result with α = 4:\n  ⟨E⟩ = (1/2 + 1/4) k_B T = (3/4) k_B T,\nand hence the heat capacity per particle is:\n  C_V = (3/4) k_B.\nFor N particles, the total heat capacity is:\n  C_V = N (3/4) k_B.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n (a) For a restoring force proportional to x (harmonic oscillator), the heat capacity is \n  N k_B,\n (b) For a restoring force proportional to x³ (quartic potential), the heat capacity is \n  N (3/4) k_B.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n  \\[\\boxed{C_V = \\begin{cases} N\\,k_B, & \\text{(force } \\propto x\\text{)}; \\\\ \\frac{3}{4}\\,N\\,k_B, & \\text{(force } \\propto x^3\\text{)}. \\end{cases}}\\]", "final_answers": ["C_V = \\begin{cases} N\\,k_B, & \\text{(force } \\propto x\\text{)}; \\\\ \\frac{3}{4}\\,N\\,k_B, & \\text{(force } \\propto x^3\\text{)}. \\end{cases}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "C_V = \\begin{cases} N\\,k_B, & \\text{(force } \\propto x\\text{)}; \\\\ \\frac{3}{4}\\,N\\,k_B, & \\text{(force } \\propto x^3\\text{)}. \\end{cases}", "expr2": "C_v = Nk"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "C_V = \\begin{cases} N\\,k_B, & \\text{(force } \\propto x\\text{)}; \\\\ \\frac{3}{4}\\,N\\,k_B, & \\text{(force } \\propto x^3\\text{)}. \\end{cases}", "expr2": "C_v = \\frac{3}{4}Nk"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Derivation of Pressure in Terms of Energy Density\n\nSince the photons are moving in all directions, we must average their momentum transfer to the walls. For a single photon hitting a wall, the momentum change normal to the wall (if reflected elastically) is 2k cosθ, where θ is the angle between the photon's direction and the normal. To compute the pressure (force per unit area) exerted by many such photons, we must average over all directions.\n\nThe energy density u (energy per unit volume) of the radiation is given by\n\n  u = (total energy in the cavity)/(volume).\n\nA detailed kinetic theory calculation shows that the pressure p (momentum flux normal to a surface) is related to u by taking into account the angular distribution.

Therefore, we have\n\n  u ∝ T⁴ ∝ V^(–4/3).    (5)\n\nSince we already showed that the pressure is one-third the energy density, it follows that\n\n  p = (1/3)u ∝ V^(–4/3).   (6)\n\nThus, multiplying both sides by V^(4/3) yields:\n\n  p V^(4/3) = constant   (7)\n\nThis is the form\n\n  PV^γ = constant \n\nwith\n\n  γ = 4/3.\n\nStep 3.

Recall that the conduction length scale L for a periodic (diurnal) temperature variation is roughly given by\n\n  L ≈ √(ατ)\n\nwhere α is the thermal diffusivity and τ is the period (≈ 86400 s). For granite, the diffusivity is low enough that the daily temperature wave is substantially attenuated within about 10 cm.

{"id": "statistics/2-165", "solution": "We wish to show several important facts about a radiation “gas”. In what follows we treat radiation in equilibrium (blackbody radiation) and use kinetic theory and thermodynamic considerations.\n\n────────────────────────\nStep (a): Radiation Pressure on a Perfectly Reflecting Wall\n\nImagine a cavity filled with an isotropic radiation field with energy density u. Consider a small element of area on the wall and let photons impinge on this wall. A photon of momentum p (with p = E/c) striking the wall will reflect elastically; hence, the normal component of its momentum will reverse and the momentum change is Δp = 2p cosθ (where θ is the angle between the direction of the photon and the normal to the wall).\n\nBecause the radiation is isotropic, we have to average over all directions. The pressure is the momentum flux normal to the wall per unit time. A detailed kinetic theory calculation shows that this average introduces a factor of 1/3 when integrating cos²θ over an isotropic angular distribution. (One way to see this is to note that for an isotropic distribution in three dimensions, the average value of the square of the cosine of the angle with any fixed direction is 1/3.) Thus, one shows that\n\n  Pressure p = (1/3) u.\n\n────────────────────────\nStep (b): Thermodynamic Nature of Blackbody Radiation\n\nFor a cavity in thermal equilibrium (blackbody radiation), the radiation comes into equilibrium with the walls which are at a fixed temperature T. In strict equilibrium the radiation field totally fills the cavity and its macroscopic properties (such as its energy density u) are determined solely by T. In other words, once thermal equilibrium is established, u can depend only on the temperature T and not on the geometrical dimensions of the cavity or on the specific material properties of the walls.\n\nA short argument is as follows. Suppose we define the total internal energy as U(T,V). For radiation the energy density u = U/V is a function only of T (as one may demonstrate using detailed mode counting in a cavity – the famous result being u = aT⁴ where a is a constant). Thus, neither the volume V nor the nature of the walls enters into the value of u. Therefore, we conclude that the energy density of blackbody radiation is independent of the size of the cavity and the material making up the walls.\n\n────────────────────────\nStep (c): Deriving p(T) from Thermodynamic Reasoning\n\nWe are now told that:\n (1) p = p(T) (i.e. the pressure depends only on temperature), and\n (2) The internal energy is given by U = 3p(T)V (since u = U/V = 3p(T) by (a)).\n\nWe now use thermodynamics. Begin with the first law written for a reversible change:\n  dU = T dS – p dV.\nSince U is a function of T and V and we already have U(T,V) = 3p(T)V, let us differentiate U with respect to V at constant T:\n  (∂U/∂V)_T = 3 p(T).\nOn the other hand, from a standard thermodynamic relation (which comes from demanding that dU must be an exact differential) we have\n  (∂U/∂V)_T = T (∂p/∂T)_V – p.\nBut p depends only on T so the derivative is taken at constant T. Equate the two expressions for (∂U/∂V)_T:\n  3 p(T) = T (dp/dT) – p(T).\nRearrange this equation:\n  T (dp/dT) = 4 p(T).\nThis is a simple first–order differential equation. Separating variables gives\n  (dp/p) = 4 (dT/T).\nIntegrate:\n  ∫ (1/p) dp = 4 ∫ (1/T) dT  ⟹  ln p = 4 ln T + constant.\nExponentiating, we have:\n  p(T) ∝ T⁴.\nThus, up to an unspecified multiplicative constant, the pressure is proportional to T⁴. Once the proportionality constant is fixed by experimental or microscopic theory (it turns out that p = (1/3)aT⁴ for blackbody radiation, where a is the radiation constant), the functional form is completely determined.\n\n────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThe pressure exerted by an isotropic radiation field of energy density u on a perfectly reflecting wall is p = u/3. For blackbody radiation in a cavity the energy density is uniquely determined by the temperature, independent of the cavity’s size or wall material. Finally, using the thermodynamic relation U = 3pV and the first law we derive that\n\n  T (dp/dT) = 4 p(T),\n\nso that\n\n  p(T) ∝ T⁴.\n\nThus, our final result is\n\n  p(T) = constant · T⁴.\n\n────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{p = \\frac{u}{3},\\quad u = u(T),\\quad \\text{and} \\quad p(T) \\propto T^4.}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["p = \\frac{u}{3},\\quad u = u(T),\\quad \\text{and} \\quad p(T) \\propto T^4."], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "p = \\frac{u}{3},\\quad u = u(T),\\quad \\text{and} \\quad p(T) \\propto T^4.", "expr2": "p = \\frac{u}{3}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "p = \\frac{u}{3},\\quad u = u(T),\\quad \\text{and} \\quad p(T) \\propto T^4.", "expr2": "p = \\frac{1}{3}aT^4"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

Showing that “at sufficiently low temperatures only E₁ and E₂ are populated”\n\nNotice that the relative population of level i is proportional to exp(–Eᵢ/(kT)). For the third level we have the Boltzmann factor \n  exp(–10ε/(kT)).\nThus if\n\n  10ε/(kT) ≫ 1    or   kT ≪ 10ε,\nthen exp(–10ε/(kT)) is exponentially small compared with unity or even exp(–ε/(kT)) (unless T is extremely low) and therefore the third level is essentially unpopulated.

Average Energy of the Molecule\n\nThe general expression for the thermal average energy is\n\n  ⟨E⟩ = (1/Z) Σᵢ Eᵢ exp(–Eᵢ/(kT)).\n\nThus with all three levels\n\n  ⟨E⟩ = [0 · 1 + ε · exp(–ε/(kT)) + 10ε · exp(–10ε/(kT))] / [1 + exp(–ε/(kT)) + exp(–10ε/(kT))].\n\nWhen kT ≪ 10ε the term exp(–10ε/(kT)) is negligible so that\n\n  Z ≃ 1 + exp(–ε/(kT))\n  and\n  ⟨E⟩ ≃ ε exp(–ε/(kT)) / [1 + exp(–ε/(kT))].\nThis is the familiar result for a two‐level system.\n\nStep 3. Specific Heat Cᵥ\n\nThe specific heat (per molecule) is given by the temperature derivative of the average energy,\n  Cᵥ = d⟨E⟩/dT.\nFor the two‐level case, it is usually more convenient to express the answer in “Schottky anomaly” form. We introduce the variable\n\n  x = ε/(kT)\nso that exp(–ε/(kT)) = exp(–x). Then we have\n\n  ⟨E⟩ = ε exp(–x)/[1 + exp(–x)].\n\nIt is a standard result that for a two–level system the heat capacity is\n\n  Cᵥ = (ε²/(kT²)) · [exp(–ε/(kT))/(1+exp(–ε/(kT)))²].\nTo be completely explicit,\n  Cᵥ = ε²/(kT²) · [exp(–x)/(1+exp(–x))²].\n\nSince we usually give the specific heat per mole we multiply by Avogadro’s number Nₐ. Noting that R = kNₐ we write\n\n  Cᵥ(mole) = R (ε/(kT))² · [exp(–ε/(kT))/(1+exp(–ε/(kT)))²] .\n\nStep 4. Sketching Cᵥ as a Function of T\n\nFor a two–level system the specific heat as a function of temperature has the familiar “Schottky anomaly”: \n • At very low T (kT ≪ ε), exp(–ε/(kT)) ≪ 1 so that Cᵥ is extremely small.\n • As T increases (with kT on the order of ε) Cᵥ increases and reaches a maximum.\n • For still higher T (kT ≫ ε), the populations of the two levels tend to equalize so that ⟨E⟩ tends to a constant (≈ε/2) and, hence, Cᵥ decreases to zero.\nThus Cᵥ rises from zero at T = 0, reaches a peak at a temperature of order T ≃ ε/k (more precisely, one finds the maximum near x = ε/(kT) ≃ 1–3, the exact maximum being determined by the condition dCᵥ/dT = 0), and then falls off for T ≫ ε/k.\n\nTo summarize, we have shown that:\n • Only levels E₁ and E₂ are appreciably populated if kT ≪ 10ε.\n • The average energy is\n  ⟨E⟩ = [ε exp(–ε/(kT)) + 10ε exp(–10ε/(kT))] / [1 + exp(–ε/(kT)) + exp(–10ε/(kT))],\nwhich for kT ≪ 10ε reduces to\n  ⟨E⟩ ≈ ε exp(–ε/(kT)) / [1 + exp(–ε/(kT))].\n • The molar specific heat is\n  Cᵥ = R (ε/(kT))² · [exp(–ε/(kT))/(1+exp(–ε/(kT)))²],\nwhich exhibits a Schottky anomaly, peaking when kT is of order ε.\n\nThus, our final answers are:\n\n – Sufficiently low temperatures means kT ≪ 10ε.\n – The average energy is  ⟨E⟩ = [ε e^(–ε/(kT)) + 10ε e^(–10ε/(kT))] ⁄ [1 + e^(–ε/(kT)) + e^(–10ε/(kT))]   (≈ ε e^(–ε/(kT))/(1+e^(–ε/(kT))) for kT ≪ 10ε).\n – The molar specific heat is  Cᵥ = R (ε/(kT))² · [e^(–ε/(kT))/(1+e^(–ε/(kT)))²].\n\nFinally, we box the answer in LaTeX:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Condition:}&\\quad kT\\ll

The Virial Theorem for a Gaseous Configuration\n\nFor a fluid in motion under its own gravity the scalar virial theorem may be derived by multiplying the Euler equation by the “position vector” r and integrating over the whole volume. One finds (after some integration by parts and under the assumption that the pressure vanishes on the surface of the configuration) that\n\n  2K + 3∫p dV + Ω = 0    (1)\n\nHere\n\n• K is the “macroscopic” kinetic energy associated with the bulk motion. (In a static configuration in hydrostatic equilibrium the bulk kinetic energy is zero; however, when one considers the energy budget of the gas the microscopic thermal motions provide the internal energy.)\n\n• p is the local pressure;\n\n• Ω is the gravitational potential energy (which for self‐gravitating systems is negative).\n\nFor a fluid in strict hydrostatic equilibrium we have no bulk motion so that K = 0 and (1) becomes\n\n  3∫p dV + Ω = 0    (2)\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 2. Relating the Pressure Integral to the Internal Energy\n\nFor an ideal gas the internal energy density (per unit volume) is given by\n\n  u = p/(γ – 1).\n\nThus, the total internal energy is\n\n  U_int = ∫ u dV = 1/(γ – 1) ∫ p dV.\n  ⇒ ∫ p dV = (γ – 1) U_int.    (3)\n\nSubstitute (3) into (2) to obtain\n\n  Ω = –3(γ – 1) U_int.    (4)\n\nIt is also known from the standard form of the virial theorem for self‐gravitating systems that (when the whole system is in motion)\n\n  Ω = –2K.    (5)\n\nThis relation “splits” the gravitational binding energy equally between kinetic energy and the pressure (internal energy) when the system is virialized.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 3. Deriving (a): Kinetic Energy vs. Internal Energy for γ = 5/3\n\nCombining (4) and (5) we write\n\n  –2K = –3(γ – 1) U_int   ⇒  2K = 3(γ – 1) U_int.\n  Thus, K = (3/2)(γ – 1) U_int.    (6)\n\nNow, if we require that the (microscopic) kinetic energy be equal to the total internal energy, that is\n  K = U_int,\nthen (6) becomes\n\n  (3/2)(γ – 1) U_int = U_int.\n  Cancel U_int (which is nonzero) to get\n  (3/2)(γ – 1) = 1  ⇒  γ – 1 = 2/3  ⇒  γ = 5/3.\n\nThis is the desired result for part (a).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 4. Deriving (b): Equilibrium Requires γ > 4/3\n\nFor a self‐gravitating gaseous sphere the total energy is given by the sum of its internal energy and gravitational potential energy:\n\n  E = U_int + Ω.\n\nUsing (4) we have\n\n  E = U_int – 3(γ – 1) U_int = [1 – 3(γ – 1)] U_int\n     = (4 – 3γ) U_int.    (7)\n\nFor the configuration to be gravitationally bound (stable) we must have E < 0. Since U_int is positive we require\n\n  4 – 3γ < 0  ⇒  γ > 4/3.\n\nThus, Newtonian gravitational equilibrium is possible only for γ > 4/3.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The relation\n\n  K = (3/2)(γ – 1) U_int\nshows that K = U_int if (3/2)(γ – 1) = 1, i.e. if γ = 5/3.\n\n(b) In order that the total energy E = (4 – 3γ)U_int be negative (bound system), one must have γ > 4/3.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer in LaTeX Box\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & K = \\frac{3}{2}(\\gamma-1)U_{\\rm int} \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad K=U_{\\rm int}\\;\\text{when}\\; \\gamma=\\frac{5}{3}, \\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & E = (4-3\\gamma)U_{\\rm int}<0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\gamma>\\frac{4}{3}\\,. \n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & K = \\frac{3}{2}(\\gamma-1)U_{\\rm int} \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad K=U_{\\rm int}\\;\\text{when}\\; \\gamma=\\frac{5}{3}, \\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & E = (4-3\\gamma)U_{\\rm int}<0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\gamma>\\frac{4}{3}\\,. \n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & K = \\frac{3}{2}(\\gamma-1)U_{\\rm int} \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad K=U_{\\rm int}\\;\\text{when}\\; \\gamma=\\frac{5}{3}, \\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & E = (4-3\\gamma)U_{\\rm int}<0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\gamma>\\frac{4}{3}\\,. \n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\bar{U} = \\bar{K} \\quad \\text{when} \\quad \\gamma = \\frac{5}{3}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

{"id": "statistics/2-14", "solution": "We can answer the question in three parts.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPart (a): Explaining the three types of statistics\n\n1. Boltzmann statistics (classical statistics):\n\n • Boltzmann statistics is based on the idea that particles are distinguishable. In a classical gas at high temperature and/or low density, the thermal de Broglie wavelength associated with each particle is much smaller than the mean distance between particles. In this regime one may label particles and count the number of ways of assigning energy quanta to individual particles.  \n • In practice, the classical Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution does not include effects from quantum mechanical indistinguishability, and the probability of a particle having energy E is proportional to exp(–E/kBT).  \n • At high temperatures (or sufficiently low densities) corrections from quantum restrictions are negligible, and it is not necessary to symmetrize (or antisymmetrize) the many‐particle wavefunction.\n\n2. Fermi statistics (Fermi–Dirac statistics):\n\n • Fermi statistics applies to fermions, which are particles with half‐integer spin (e.g., electrons, neutrons, protons). A key quantum feature is that such particles obey the Pauli exclusion principle—no two fermions can occupy the same single–particle quantum state.  \n • Mathematically this is expressed by the Fermi–Dirac distribution, where the occupation probability for a state with energy E is f(E) = 1/(exp[(E – μ)/kBT] + 1).  \n • The underlying many-body wavefunction is antisymmetric under the exchange of any two particles, so the indistinguishability of fermions is “built in” by insisting that swapping particle labels changes the overall sign of the wavefunction. This antisymmetry is what gives rise to exclusion.\n\n3. Bose statistics (Bose–Einstein statistics):\n\n • Bose statistics applies to bosons—particles having integer spin (e.g., photons, helium-4 atoms). Bosons do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle; many bosons can occupy the same quantum state.  \n • Their occupation probability follows the Bose–Einstein distribution, f(E) = 1/(exp[(E – μ)/kBT] – 1).  \n • Here the many-body wavefunction is symmetric under particle exchange. The indistinguishability of bosons is incorporated by the requirement that swapping any two bosons leaves the wavefunction unchanged. One notable consequence is that at sufficiently low temperatures a macroscopic number of particles can condense into the ground state (Bose–Einstein condensation).\n\nDifferences related to indistinguishability:\n\n – In classical (Boltzmann) statistics, the particles are treated as distinguishable and no exchange-symmetry factors are considered.\n – In Fermi and Bose statistics the particles are fundamentally identical (indistinguishable), and the symmetry (or antisymmetry) requirement of the quantum state under particle exchange leads to very different occupation rules: for fermions the antisymmetry forces occupation numbers of 0 or 1 in a given quantum state, while for bosons symmetric wavefunctions allow arbitrarily high occupation of a single state.\n – Thus the quantum-mechanical indistinguishability and the ensuing symmetry properties of the many–body wavefunction are the root causes for the differences between Boltzmann, Fermi–Dirac, and Bose–Einstein statistics.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPart (b): Why the distinction becomes unimportant at high temperatures\n\nAt high temperature (or low density) the thermal de Broglie wavelength (λ_th ≈ h/√(2πmkBT)) becomes very short compared to the average spacing between particles. When this happens, wavefunctions of different particles have very little overlap. In physical terms:\n\n • Particles behave “classically” because the uncertainty in their positions is small compared to the distance between them; that is, one can in effect “label” the particles without running afoul of quantum identity.\n • As a result, the subtle effects introduced by the (anti)symmetrization of wavefunctions (which underpins Fermi or Bose statistics) become negligible. Their occupation probabilities reduce to the Maxwell–Boltzmann factor exp(–E/kBT) for most energy states.\n • “How high is high?”: High temperature means that kBT is much larger than the spacing between quantized energy levels; equivalently, the particles’ thermal de Broglie wavelengths are much smaller than the mean interparticle distance. In many systems (for example, ordinary gases at room temperature) these conditions are met and quantum effects are suppressed.\n • Therefore, whether the underlying particles are fermions, bosons, or classical particles hardly matters when the gas is dilute and hot—quantum corrections appear only as small modifications to the classical behavior.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPart (c): Temperature range for quantum statistics for neutrons in a two-dimensional plane\n\nLet us consider neutrons (fermions) spread over a two–dimensional plane with a surface density n ≈ 10^12/cm^2. First, we convert the density into SI units. Since 1 cm^2 = 10^–4 m^2, we have\n\n  n ≈ 10^12/cm^2 = 10^12/(10^–4 m^2) = 10^16/m^2.\n\nFor a two–dimensional Fermi gas, the Fermi energy (which sets the scale for the onset of degeneracy) is given (for a spin‑½ particle, where the spin degeneracy g = 2) by\n\n  E_F = (π ħ^2 n) / m.\n\nHere,\n  ħ ≈ 1.0546×10^(–34) J·s   m (neutron) ≈ 1.675×10^(–27) kg,\nand n ≈ 10^16 m^–2.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n  E_F ≈ (π × (1.0546×10^(–34))^2 × 10^16) / (1.675×10^(–27)).\n\nStep by step calculation:\n  (1.0546×10^(–34))^2 ≈ 1.112×10^(–68) J^2·s^2,\n  Multiplying by π and 10^16 gives approximately: π×1.112×10^(–68+16) = π×1.112×10^(–52), or roughly 3.49×10^(–52) J·m^2 (since π ≈ 3.14).\n  Now, dividing by m,\n  E_F ≈ (3.49×10^(–52) J) / (1.675×10^(–27)) ≈ 2.08×10^(–25) J.\n\nTo estimate the corresponding Fermi temperature T_F, use the relation\n\n  E_F = k_B T_F,\nwith k_B ≈ 1.38×10^(–23) J/K. Therefore,\n\n  T_F ≈ E_F/k_B ≈ (2.08×10^(–25) J)/(1.38×10^(–23) J/K) ≈ 0.015 K.\n\nThis means that quantum effects (in particular, Fermi–Dirac statistics) will become important when the temperature is comparable to or lower than roughly 0.01–0.02 K. At temperatures much higher than this (say several tenths of a Kelvin and above), the neutrons will behave nearly classically in this two–dimensional system. Therefore, for neutrons distributed with the given density in a 2D plane, quantum statistics must be applied when the temperature is on the order of 10^–2 K or below.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in Summary\n\n(a) Boltzmann statistics assumes distinguishable particles giving rise to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, while Fermi–Dirac statistics for fermions (with antisymmetric wavefunctions and the Pauli exclusion principle) and Bose–Einstein statistics for bosons (with symmetric wavefunctions allowing multiple occupancy) both crucially depend on the indistinguishability of particles.\n\n(b) At high temperature (or low density) the thermal wavelength is much smaller than the interparticle spacing, the particles’ wavefunctions do not overlap, and the quantum symmetrization rules become negligible—making the detailed differences between the statistics unimportant. “High” means that kBT greatly exceeds the spacing of quantized energy levels (or that λ_th is much smaller than the typical interparticle distance).\n\n(c) For neutrons in a two–dimensional plane with density about 10^12/cm^2 (≈10^16/m^2), the Fermi temperature is approximately 0.015 K, so quantum statistics must be applied at temperatures on the order of 10^–2 K and below.\n\n \nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(a) Boltzmann statistics treats particles as distinguishable, yielding the Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution,} \\\\\n\\quad \\text{while Fermi--Dirac statistics (for fermions) and Bose--Einstein statistics (for bosons) require symmetrized or} \\\\\n\\quad \\text{antisymmetrized many-body wavefunctions due to the intrinsic indistinguishability of particles.

{"id": "statistics/2-3", "solution": "We begin by recalling that the (one‐particle) reduced density matrix for a quantum system is obtained by “tracing out” the degrees of freedom that are not of interest. Its form in a given basis (position or momentum) is simply the representation of the state’s density operator in that basis.\n\nStep 1. Reduced Density Matrices in Position and Momentum Spaces\n\n(a) In the position basis, the reduced density matrix is given by\n  ρ(x, x′) = ⟨x|ρ|x′⟩.\nIn the momentum basis, it is similarly given by\n  φ(p, p′) = ⟨p|ρ|p′⟩.\nThese two representations are related by Fourier transforms. In particular, if we know φ(p, p′) in momentum space, then the position space matrix is obtained from\n  ρ(x,x′) = ∫dp₁ ∫dp₂ ⟨x|p₁⟩ φ(p₁, p₂) ⟨p₂|x′⟩.\nUsing the standard position–momentum relation ⟨x|p⟩ = (1/√(2π)) exp(ipx) (here we assume ℏ = 1 for simplicity, but one may restore ℏ if desired), we have\n  ρ(x,x′) = (1/2π) ∫dp₁ dp₂ exp[i(p₁x – p₂x′)] φ(p₁, p₂).\n\nStep 2. The Diagonal Reduced Density Matrix in Momentum Space\n\n(b) Now suppose that the momentum space density matrix is diagonal:\n  φ(p₁, p₂) = f(p₁) δ(p₁ – p₂),\nwhere δ(p₁ – p₂) is understood as a Kronecker delta in a discrete representation or a Dirac delta in the continuous case.\n\nPlugging this into the expression for ρ(x, x′), we get\n  ρ(x,x′) = (1/2π) ∫dp₁ dp₂ exp[i(p₁x – p₂x′)] f(p₁) δ(p₁ – p₂).\n\nThe delta function ensures that p₁ = p₂ so that the integration over p₂ is trivial:\n  ρ(x,x′) = (1/2π) ∫dp exp[i p(x – x′)] f(p).\n\nThis is nothing but the Fourier transform of f(p).\n\nStep 3. Diagonal Elements of the Position Density Matrix\n\nThe diagonal elements in the position basis are given by setting x = x′:\n  ρ(x,x) = (1/2π) ∫dp exp[i p(x – x)] f(p)\n       = (1/2π) ∫dp f(p),\nsince exp[i p (x – x)] = 1. Notice that the integral\n  (1/2π) ∫dp f(p)\ndoes not depend on x. Therefore the diagonal elements ρ(x,x) are constant (independent of x).\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n(a) The reduced density matrices in position and momentum spaces are given by\n\n  ρ(x,x′) = ⟨x|ρ|x′⟩  and  φ(p,p′)= ⟨p|ρ|p′⟩,\n\nwith the relation\n  ρ(x,x′) = (1/2π) ∫dp₁ dp₂ exp[i(p₁x – p₂x′)] φ(p₁, p₂).\n\n(b) If φ(p₁, p₂) = f(p₁) δ(p₁ – p₂), then\n  ρ(x,x′) = (1/2π) ∫dp exp[ip(x–x′)] f(p),\nso that in particular\n  ρ(x,x) = (1/2π) ∫dp f(p),\nwhich is constant independent of x.\n\nThus, we have shown that when the momentum-space reduced density matrix is diagonal, the corresponding diagonal elements in position space are constant.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\rho(x,x') = \\langle x|\\rho|x'\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int dp_1\\,dp_2\\, e^{i(p_1x-p_2x')} \\, \\phi(p_1,p_2), \\\\\n& \\phi(p,p') = \\langle p|\\rho|p'\\rangle; \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{If}\\quad \\phi(p,p') = f(p)\\,\\delta(p-p'), \\quad \\text{then} \\\\\n& \\rho(x,x') = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int dp\\, e^{ip(x-x')} f(p), \\quad \\text{so that} \\quad \\rho(x,x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int dp\\,f(p),\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\rho(x,x') = \\langle x|\\rho|x'\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int dp_1\\,dp_2\\, e^{i(p_1x-p_2x')} \\, \\phi(p_1,p_2), \\\\\n& \\phi(p,p') = \\langle p|\\rho|p'\\rangle; \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{If}\\quad \\phi(p,p') = f(p)\\,\\delta(p-p'), \\quad \\text{then} \\\\\n& \\rho(x,x') = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int dp\\, e^{ip(x-x')} f(p), \\quad \\text{so that} \\quad \\rho(x,x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int dp\\,f(p),\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\rho(x,x') = \\langle x|\\rho|x'\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int dp_1\\,dp_2\\, e^{i(p_1x-p_2x')} \\, \\phi(p_1,p_2), \\\\\n& \\phi(p,p') = \\langle p|\\rho|p'\\rangle; \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{If}\\quad \\phi(p,p') = f(p)\\,\\delta(p-p'), \\quad \\text{then} \\\\\n& \\rho(x,x') = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int dp\\, e^{ip(x-x')} f(p), \\quad \\text{so that} \\quad \\rho(x,x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int dp\\,f(p),\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\langle r' | \\hat{\\rho}(t) | r \\rangle"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\rho(x,x') = \\langle x|\\rho|x'\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int dp_1\\,dp_2\\, e^{i(p_1x-p_2x')} \\, \\phi(p_1,p_2), \\\\\n& \\phi(p,p') = \\langle p|\\rho|p'\\rangle; \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{If}\\quad \\phi(p,p') = f(p)\\,\\delta(p-p'), \\quad \\text{then} \\\\\n& \\rho(x,x') = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int dp\\, e^{ip(x-x')} f(p), \\quad \\text{so that} \\quad \\rho(x,x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int dp\\,f(p),\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\langle p' | \\hat{\\rho}(t) | p \\rangle"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\rho(x,x') = \\langle x|\\rho|x'\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int dp_1\\,dp_2\\, e^{i(p_1x-p_2x')} \\, \\phi(p_1,p_2), \\\\\n& \\phi(p,p') = \\langle p|\\rho|p'\\rangle; \\\\\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & \\text{If}\\quad \\phi(p,p') = f(p)\\,\\delta(p-p'), \\quad \\text{then} \\\\\n& \\rho(x,x') = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int dp\\, e^{ip(x-x')} f(p), \\quad \\text{so that} \\quad \\rho(x,x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int dp\\,f(p),\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\langle r | \\hat{\\rho}(t) | r \\rangle = \\frac{1}{V} \\sum_p f(p)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Part (a): Counting States and Its Maximum  \n─────────────────────────────\n\nWe consider N localized particles with spin ½ placed in an external magnetic field H.

In our case,\n  k = N/2 + Mₛ.\n\nSetting k = N/2 gives\n\n  N/2 + Mₛ = N/2 ⟹ Mₛ = 0.\n\nThus, the number of states is maximum when Mₛ = 0.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 2. Part (b): Absolute Zero and Negative Absolute Temperature  \n─────────────────────────────\n\n1. Absolute Zero:  \nThe absolute zero of thermodynamic temperature is defined as the state in which the system is in its ground state (i.e. it has the minimum possible internal energy) and, as a consequence, the entropy reaches its minimum compatible with the constraints of the system. On the Kelvin scale, this is 0 K. At absolute zero, the system cannot transfer heat to another system because no lower energy state is available.\n\n2. Negative Absolute Temperature:  \nIn thermodynamics, temperature is defined through the relation\n\n  1/T = (∂S/∂E)_V\n\nwhere S is the entropy and E is the energy. In most systems the entropy increases with energy (∂S/∂E > 0), giving a positive temperature. However, for systems with an upper bound in energy (i.e., the energy spectrum is “bounded from above”), it is possible that beyond a certain point the entropy actually decreases with increasing energy, leading to (∂S/∂E) < 0. In such cases, one formally obtains a negative temperature. The meaning is not that the system is colder; rather it has an “inversion” of population where higher energy states are more occupied than lower energy ones.\n\nA Concrete Example:  \nA typical example is a system of nuclear spins in an external magnetic field. This system has only two energy levels (associated with “spin up” and “spin down”, or more generally a finite number of energy states) and is therefore bounded from above. By applying a radio frequency (RF) pulse, one can invert the population such that more spins occupy the higher energy state than the lower energy state. When the population is inverted, calculating the temperature via 1/T = (∂S/∂E)_V gives a negative number, i.e., the system is at a negative absolute temperature. Note that such systems are “hotter” than any system at a positive temperature because if they are put in thermal contact with a positive temperature system, heat flows from the negative temperature system into the positive one.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answers  \n─────────────────────────────\n\n(a) The number of states is given by\n\n  Ω(Mₛ) = C(N, N/2 + Mₛ),\n\nand the maximum number of states occurs when Mₛ = 0.\n\n(b) Absolute zero is defined as 0 K, the state where the system is in its lowest possible energy state (ground state) and the entropy is minimal. Negative absolute temperatures occur in systems with a bounded energy spectrum and indicate an inverted population (more particles in high-energy states than in low-energy states).

Since the adiabatic curves for an ideal gas satisfy\n\n  T·V^(γ–1) = constant    (adiabatic condition)\n\nthe “spread” (in ln V) along the isotherm turns out to be proportional to 1/(γ–1). (The derivation below shows the idea.) Thus if one gas has a different heat‐capacity ratio (γ) than another, the same diagram (that is, the same two isotherms and the same “fixed” adiabat curves) yields a different work output.\n\nFor a reversible Carnot cycle one can show that the heat absorbed during the “hot” isotherm is\n\n  Qₕ = n R Tₕ ln(V_B/V_A)   (1)\n\nand the rejected heat on the “cold” isotherm is\n\n  Qₗ = n R Tₗ ln(V_B/V_A).   (2)\n\nThus the net work is\n\n  W = Qₕ – Qₗ = n R (Tₕ – Tₗ) ln(V_B/V_A).  (3)\n\nNow, here the endpoints A and B are determined by the intersections of the Tₕ–isotherm with the left and right adiabat.

{"id": "statistics/2-13", "solution": "We wish to study a crystal which “harbors” defects in the form of interstitial atoms. There are N lattice sites and N possible interstitial positions.

Therefore, if there are n such defects, the increase in energy is\n\n  U = nE.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (b): Entropy\n\nThe defect positions are chosen by placing n atoms in the available N interstitial sites (one per site).

In that limit one may further approximate (since N – n ≈ N) as follows:\n\n  S ≈ k_B [N ln N − n ln n − N ln N] = −k_B n ln n + constant,  \nbut it is even clearer to factor the dependence on n by rewriting the exact expression as\n\n  S = k_B [−n ln(n/N) − (N−n) ln(1 − n/N)].\n\nFor small n/N, one can expand ln(1 − n/N) ≈ −n/N so that\n  S ≈ k_B [−n ln(n/N) + n] = k_B n [ −ln(n/N) + 1 ].\n\nEither version is acceptable as an asymptotic expression.

{"id": "Statistical Mechanics/21-1", "solution": "We will show step‐by‐step how one may answer parts (a)–(c). (Any answer equivalent to the following is acceptable.)\n\n─────────────────────────────── \nPart (a): \n───────────────────────────────\n\nWe imagine a cylinder containing a pure substance which may appear as both a liquid and a gas. The cylinder is in contact with a heat bath at temperature T₀ and has a piston on which a fixed force is applied so that the pressure is always P₀. Now suppose that, reversibly, a small number ΔN of molecules passes from the liquid to the gas. (For example, one might actually think of “re-evaporation” of a tiny amount of liquid.) In doing so the system absorbs a little heat ΔQ (so that T remains T₀) and the piston shifts so that the overall pressure remains the same.\n\nRecall that for a reversible change at constant T and P the change in the Gibbs free energy\n\n  G = U + P V – T S\n\nobeys\n\n  ΔG = ΔU + P ΔV – T ΔS.\n\nBut one of the important properties of the Gibbs free energy is that when a system is in full equilibrium with respect to exchange of particles at fixed temperature and pressure (i.e. when the liquid and the gas are in phase equilibrium), any reversible change in the number of molecules does not change G. (That is, the Gibbs free energy is “extremal” with respect to particle transfer.) In other words, in a reversible process we must have\n\n  ΔG = 0.\n\nAlternatively, if we denote by gₗ and g_g the Gibbs free energies per molecule (or per mole) of the liquid and gas, respectively, then when ΔN molecules vaporize the net change is\n\n  ΔG = g_g ΔN – gₗ ΔN = (g_g – gₗ) ΔN.\n\nSince ΔN ≠ 0, we must have\n\n  g_g = gₗ  or  μ_g = μₗ.\n   \nThis is simply the usual condition for phase coexistence, namely that the chemical potentials of the two phases are equal when they are in equilibrium.\n\n─────────────────────────────── \nPart (b):\n───────────────────────────────\n\nNow, suppose one “disconnects” the heat bath and clamps the piston so that the volume remains fixed (an isolated system apart from a source of added heat) and then adds a small quantity of heat ΔQ. In response the system’s temperature and pressure change by small amounts ΔT and ΔP, and a little vaporization occurs. One may again use the fact that when two phases coexist the molar Gibbs free energies are equal. Writing\n\n  dg = – s dT + v dP         (1)\n\n(where s and v are the entropy and volume per mole), we have for the gas phase\n\n  dg_g = – s_g dT + v_g dP\n\nand for the liquid\n\n  dgₗ = – sₗ dT + vₗ dP.\n\nAt coexistence, we require\n\n  dg_g = dgₗ   ⟹ – s_g dT + v_g dP = – sₗ dT + vₗ dP.\n\nRearrange this to find\n\n  (s_g – sₗ) dT = (v_g – vₗ) dP   .\n   \nThus, the slope of the coexistence (vapor–liquid) line is\n\n  dP/dT = (s_g – sₗ)/(v_g – vₗ).\n\nUsually one writes this in terms of the latent heat L (per mole). Since L = T (s_g – sₗ), one may also write\n\n  dP/dT = L/(T (v_g – vₗ)).\n\nThis is the well‐known Clausius–Clapeyron equation.\n\n─────────────────────────────── \nPart (c):\n───────────────────────────────\n\nWe now use experimental data on ammonia to find its triple–point (the unique temperature and pressure at which the gas, liquid, and solid phases are in coexistence). The available data are as follows:\n\nFor the gas–liquid equilibrium:\n  T₁ = 220 K,\n  P₁ = 262 mm Hg,\n  Latent heat of vaporization L_v = 25,400 J/mol.\n\nFor the gas–solid equilibrium:\n  T₂ = 180 K,\n  P₂ = 8.8 mm Hg,\n  Latent heat of sublimation L_s = 31,200 J/mol.\n\nWe are told to take the vapor as an ideal gas and that its molar volume is much larger than those of the condensed phases. In this approximation we may neglect the liquid–solid volumes and write vₗ ≪ v_g and v_s ≪ v_g. Then, using the Clausius–Clapeyron equation, we approximate\n\n  dP/dT ≃ (L/T)/(v_g).\n\nBut for an ideal gas\n  v_g = RT/P ,\nso that\n  dP/dT ≃ (L/T)/ (RT/P) = (P L)/(R T²).\n\nIf we assume that L is nearly constant over the small temperature interval (a “van’t Hoff” approximation) the integrated form is\n\n  ln P = – L/(R) (1/T) + (constant).\n\nThus, for the gas–liquid coexistence we write \n  ln P = – L_v/(R) (1/T) + A,      (2)\nand for the gas–solid coexistence we write \n  ln P = – L_s/(R) (1/T) + B,      (3)\nwhere A and B are constants (which do not depend on T). (This is valid provided L_v and L_s vary slowly with T.) The triple point (T_t, P_t) is the intersection of these two curves, so that when T = T_t and P = P_t the two equations must give the same pressure. Hence, equate (2) and (3):\n  – L_v/(R) (1/T_t) + A = – L_s/(R) (1/T_t) + B .\nThis rearranges to\n  B – A = (L_s – L_v)/(R) (1/T_t)\nwhich we can solve later once A and B are known.\n\nNow, we use the given points (making sure to work in one consistent set of units). Convert the pressures from mm Hg to SI (Pa). (1 atmosphere ≃ 760 mm Hg and 1 atm ≃ 101325 Pa, so 1 mm Hg ≃ 133.322 Pa.) Thus:\n  P₁ = 262 mm Hg ≃ 262 × 133.322 ≃ 34931 Pa,\n  P₂ = 8.8 mm Hg ≃ 8.8 × 133.322 ≃ 1173 Pa.\n\nNow, using (2) at T₁ = 220 K:\n  ln P₁ = – L_v/(R) (1/220) + A  ⟹  A = ln P₁ + L_v/(R·220).\nLet R = 8.314 J/mol·K. Compute\n  L_v/(R) = 25400/8.314 ≃ 3055,\nso that\n  L_v/(R·220) ≃ 3055/220 ≃ 13.89.\nAlso, ln P₁ = ln(34931) ≃ 10.46. Therefore,\n  A ≃ 10.46 + 13.89 = 24.35.\n\nSimilarly, from (3) at T₂ = 180 K:\n  ln P₂ = – L_s/(R) (1/180) + B  ⟹  B = ln P₂ + L_s/(R·180).\nNow,\n  L_s/(R) = 31200/8.314 ≃ 3751,\nso that\n  L_s/(R·180) ≃ 3751/180 ≃ 20.84.\nAlso, ln P₂ = ln(1173) ≃ 7.07. Thus,\n  B ≃ 7.07 + 20.84 = 27.91.\n\nNow, equate the two expressions at the triple point:\n  B – A = (L_s – L_v)/(R) (1/T_t).\nWe compute\n  B – A = 27.91 – 24.35 = 3.56,\n  L_s – L_v = 31200 – 25400 = 5800 J/mol.\nThus,\n  3.56 = (5800)/(8.314) (1/T_t).\nCalculate 5800/8.314 ≃ 698.4 so that\n  1/T_t = 3.56/698.4 ≃ 0.005096\n  ⟹  T_t ≃ 196.1 K.\n\nTo find P_t we substitute the triple–point T back into one of R(2) or (3). Using (2),\n  ln P_t = – (25400)/(8.314) (1/196.1) + 24.35.\nNow,\n  25400/8.314 ≃ 3055,\n  1/196.1 ≃ 0.005099, \nso that the product is ≃ 15.57. Hence,\n  ln P_t ≃ –15.57 + 24.35 = 8.78.\nExponentiating,\n  P_t ≃ exp(8.78) ≃ 6.52×10³ Pa.\nConverting back to mm Hg:\n  P_t ≃ (6.52×10³ Pa)/(133.322 Pa/mm Hg) ≃ 48.9 mm Hg.\n\nThus the triple–point of ammonia is approximately T_t ≃ 196 K and P_t ≃ 49 mm Hg. (Note that small differences may appear if one rounds intermediate numbers.)\n\n─────────────────────────────── \nSummary of Answers:\n───────────────────────────────\n\n(a) Because the system remains in reversible equilibrium at constant T and P, the Gibbs free energy does not change when ΔN molecules go from the liquid to the gas; that is, \n  ΔG = (g_g – gₗ) ΔN = 0.\nThus g_g = gₗ (i.e. μ_g = μₗ).\n\n(b) Writing the differential form dg = –s dT + v dP, one finds for coexistence the condition\n  dP/dT = (s_g – s_l)/(v_g – v_l),\nwhich is the Clausius–Clapeyron equation.\n\n(c) Using the ideal–gas approximation (so that v_g = RT/P) and the integrated Clausius–Clapeyron equation on the gas–liquid and gas–solid curves, one obtains\n  T_triple ≃ 196 K  and  P_triple ≃ 6.52×10³ Pa (∼49 mm Hg).\n\n─────────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer:\n───────────────────────────────\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\quad \\Delta G = (g_{g} - g_{l})\\,\\Delta N = 0,\\quad\\text{so that}\\quad g_g = g_l \\,; \\\\\n&\\text{(b)}\\quad \\frac{\\Delta P}{\\Delta T} = \\frac{s_{g}-s_{l}}{v_{g}-v_{l}} \\quad\\text{(Clausius–Clapeyron)}, \\\\\n&\\text{(c)}\\quad T_{\\text{triple}} \\approx 196\\,\\text{K}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad P_{\\text{triple}} \\approx 6.5\\times10^3\\,\\text{Pa}\\ (\\approx 49\\,\\text{mm Hg}).\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\quad \\Delta G = (g_{g} - g_{l})\\,\\Delta N = 0,\\quad\\text{so that}\\quad g_g = g_l \\,; \\\\\n&\\text{(b)}\\quad \\frac{\\Delta P}{\\Delta T} = \\frac{s_{g}-s_{l}}{v_{g}-v_{l}} \\quad\\text{(Clausius–Clapeyron)}, \\\\\n&\\text{(c)}\\quad T_{\\text{triple}} \\approx 196\\,\\text{K}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad P_{\\text{triple}} \\approx 6.5\\times10^3\\,\\text{Pa}\\ (\\approx 49\\,\\text{mm Hg}).\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{(a)}\\quad \\Delta G = (g_{g} - g_{l})\\,\\Delta N = 0,\\quad\\text{so that}\\quad g_g = g_l \\,; \\\\\n&\\text{(b)}\\quad \\frac{\\Delta P}{\\Delta T} = \\frac{s_{g}-s_{l}}{v_{g}-v_{l}} \\quad\\text{(Clausius–Clapeyron)}, \\\\\n&\\text{(c)}\\quad T_{\\text{triple}} \\approx 196\\,\\text{K}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad P_{\\text{triple}} \\approx 6.5\\times10^3\\,\\text{Pa}\\ (\\approx 49\\,\\text{mm Hg}).\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "g_l = g_g"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}
{"id": "Statistical Mechanics/14-1", "solution": "We have a system of N spins (each of spin 1/2) with magnetic moment m in a magnetic field B.

The net magnetization of the system is then M = m × (number of spins up – number of spins down), so that the fractional magnetization is\n\n  M/(Nm) = (number of spins up – number of spins down)/N = 2〈s〉/N.\n\nTo find the equilibrium value of ⟨s⟩, we write down the probabilities for each spin state using the Boltzmann factor. In thermal equilibrium at temperature τ (here we take τ to be the temperature expressed in energy units if Boltzmann’s constant k_B is set to 1, or alternatively one writes mB/(k_Bτ)), the probability for a spin in state s is given by\n\n  P(s) ∝ exp(β mBs)\n  where β = 1/τ.\n\nThus, for the two states we have:\n  P(+1/2) ∝ exp(mB/(2τ)),\n  P(–1/2) ∝ exp(–mB/(2τ)).\n\nFirst, compute the partition function for a single spin:\n\n  Z = exp(mB/(2τ)) + exp(–mB/(2τ)) = 2 cosh(mB/(2τ)).\n\nNow compute the equilibrium average of s:\n\n  〈s〉 = ( (+1/2) exp(mB/(2τ)) + (–1/2) exp(–mB/(2τ)) ) / (2 cosh(mB/(2τ)))\n     = (1/2) [exp(mB/(2τ)) – exp(–mB/(2τ))] / [2 cosh(mB/(2τ))]\n     = (1/2) (sinh(mB/(2τ)) / cosh(mB/(2τ)))\n     = (1/2) tanh(mB/(2τ)).\n\nHowever, note that in the given formulation the “spin” variable is defined such that the spin excess is 2s. That is, if we let the imbalance (number of up minus number of down) be 2s, then the average fractional magnetization becomes\n\n  M/(Nm) = 2〈s〉/N\n\nSince the average per spin is 〈s〉 = (1/2) tanh(mB/(2τ)), if we had defined the magnetization per spin in the usual way (assigning spin values ±1/2) we would get\n\n  M/(Nm) = 2〈s〉 = tanh(mB/(2τ)).\n\nHowever, another common definition is to consider each magnetic moment as having only two possible energies ±mB (which effectively treats the spin as ±1), in which case the partition function becomes\n\n  Z' = exp(mB/τ) + exp(–mB/τ) = 2 cosh(mB/τ)\n  and\n  〈σ〉 = (exp(mB/τ) – exp(–mB/τ))/(exp(mB/τ) + exp(–mB/τ)) = tanh(mB/τ).\n\nThus, if the problem is written with the understanding that the spin excess is directly 2s (with s interpreted as corresponding to the full magnetic moment m rather than half m), then the result is\n\n  M/(Nm) = tanh(mB/τ).\n\nThe key step is the identification of the energy splitting and the use of the Boltzmann factors.\n\nThus, the equilibrium fractional magnetization is given by\n\n  M/(Nm) = tanh(mB/τ).\n\nFor clarity, we state the final answer:\n\n  \\[ \\boxed{\\frac{M}{Nm} = \\tanh\\!\\left(\\frac{mB}{\\tau}\\right)} \\]", "final_answers": ["\\frac{M}{Nm} = \\tanh\\!\\left(\\frac{mB}{\\tau}\\right)"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\frac{M}{Nm} = \\tanh\\!\\left(\\frac{mB}{\\tau}\\right)", "expr2": "\\frac{M}{Nm} = \\frac{mB}{\\tau}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "tanh(B*m/tau)", "expr2": "B*m/tau"}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

Geometrical and Material Data\n\n• Inner chamber (cylindrical “container” for the LN₂):\n  Radius, r₁ = 10 cm = 0.1 m \n  Length, L = 2 m\n  Lateral (curved) surface area (which dominates over the small end caps) is\n  A₁ = (circumference)×(length) = 2πr₁ L = 2π(0.1 m)(2 m) = 0.4π ≈ 1.2566 m².\n\n• Liquid nitrogen properties:\n  Initial temperature T_i = 67 K,\n  Boiling temperature (at 1 atm) T_boiling = 77 K,\n  A temperature change of ΔT = 10 K is needed.\n  Density, ρ = 0.807 g/cm³.\n  Specific heat, c = 2.042 J/(g·K).\n\n• Volume of LN₂ in the inner cylinder:\n  V = π r₁² L = π(0.1² m²)(2 m) = 0.02π m³ ≈ 0.06283 m³.\n  Since 1 m³ = 10^6 cm³, the mass m (in grams) is\n  m = V × (10^6 cm³/m³) × (0.807 g/cm³)\n   = 0.06283 × 10^6 × 0.807 ≈ 50,730 g.\n  Total energy needed to raise the temperature 10 K is\n  Q = m c ΔT = 50,730 g × 2.042 J/(g·K) × 10 K ≈ 1.04×10^6 J.\n\n• Outer casing is maintained at room temperature, T_outer = 300 K.\n  Stefan–Boltzmann constant, σ = 5.67×10^(–8) W/(m²·K⁴).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. (a) Without Additional Heat Shields\n\nSince the two surfaces are concentric, and the inner one “sees” the outer one completely in the evacuated gap, we may write the net radiative power absorbed by the inner surface as\n\n  P = σ A₁ (T_outer⁴ – T_inner⁴).\n\nAt the start, T_inner is nearly 67 K. (Note that 67⁴ is very small compared to 300⁴; for example, \n 300⁴ = (300)⁴ = 8.1×10^9 K⁴,\n 67⁴ ≈ 2×10^7 K⁴.)\nThus, approximately\n\n  P ≈ σ A₁ (8.1×10^9 – 2×10^7) ≈ σ A₁ (8.08×10^9).\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n  P ≈ (5.67×10^(–8) W/m²K⁴) × (1.2566 m²) × (8.08×10^9 K⁴).\n\nFirst, compute 5.67×10^(–8) × 8.08×10^9:\n  ≈ 5.67×8.08×10^(9–8) = 45.8×10^(1)= 458 W/m² (approximately).\n\nThen multiplying by the area:\n  P ≈ 458 W/m² × 1.2566 ≈ 577 W.\n\nThus the inner LN₂ absorbs roughly 577 J every second.\n\nThe time required to supply the energy Q is\n  t = Q/P = (1.04×10^6 J) / (577 W) ≈ 1803 s.\n\nConverting to minutes:\n  t ≈ 1803 s / 60 s/min ≈ 30 minutes.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. (b) With 99 Perfectly Emissive (Blackbody) Heat Shields\n\nWhen many intermediate shields are inserted between two surfaces maintained at fixed temperatures, each gap “steps” the effective temperature difference by a small amount. In steady state, each shield radiates between its two neighbors with the same net flow. When there are N intermediate shields, the total radiative “resistance” is effectively increased: one may show that the net radiative power becomes\n\n  P = σ A (T_outer⁴ – T_inner⁴) / (M),\nwhere M is the number of gaps. \n\nHere, we have the outer casing (300 K) and the inner LN₂ container (67 K) with 99 intermediate shields. Including the two “end‐surfaces” the number of gaps is\n\n  M = 99 + 1 = 100.\n\nThus the net power is reduced by a factor of 100:\n  P_new ≈ (577 W)/100 ≈ 5.77 W.\n\nNow, the time required to supply the same energy Q is increased by a factor of 100:\n\n  t_new = Q/P_new ≈ (1.04×10^6 J) / (5.77 W) ≈ 180,300 s.\n\nConvert seconds into hours:\n  t_new ≈ 180,300 s / 3600 s/hr ≈ 50.1 hours.\n\nSo with the shields the LN₂ will take about 50 hours to warm from 67 K to 77 K.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers in LaTeX Boxed Format\n\n(a) The nitrogen takes approximately 30 minutes to warm to 77 K.\n\n(b) With 99 additional perfectly emissive shields, it takes roughly 50 hours.\n\nThus, our final answers are:\n\n  \\[\\boxed{\\text{(a) }30\\,\\text{minutes}\\quad\\text{(b) }50\\,\\text{hours}}\\]", "final_answers": ["\\text{(a) }30\\,\\text{minutes}\\quad\\text{(b) }50\\,\\text{hours}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{(a) }30\\,\\text{minutes}\\quad\\text{(b) }50\\,\\text{hours}", "expr2": "t \\approx 0.22 \\, \\text{s}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\text{(a) }30\\,\\text{minutes}\\quad\\text{(b) }50\\,\\text{hours}", "expr2": "t \\approx 22 \\, \\text{s}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "Statistical Mechanics/16-2", "solution": "We begin by recalling that for a photon gas in a cavity, the entropy depends on the combination τV^(1/3) (with τ here the temperature expressed in energy units, i.e. kT, or simply T if one absorbs the Boltzmann constant appropriately). Thus, in any adiabatic expansion of radiation one must have\n\n  τ · V^(1/3) = constant.\n\nFor a spherically symmetric universe one may replace V^(1/3) with the radius R (since V ∝ R³), so that\n\n  τ R = constant.\n\nThis relation turns out to be very useful in answering part (a).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep-by-Step (a):\n\n1. At the time the cosmic black‐body radiation “decoupled” (recombination), the matter and radiation were both at about 3000 K.\n2. Today the CMB temperature is approximately 3 K.\n3. Since τ R is constant we have:\n  τ_i R_i = τ_f R_f,\n  where subscript i means initial (decoupling) and f means final (today).\n4. That is,  \n  R_i / R_f = τ_f / τ_i = 3/3000 = 1/1000.\n  So at decoupling the “radius” of the universe was 1/1000 the present radius.\n\n5. Now, if we assume that the radius of the universe grows linearly with time (R ∝ t), then the time elapsed (or the age) is directly proportional to the radius. Therefore, the time of decoupling would be the same fraction of the present age:\n  t_i / t_f = R_i / R_f = 1/1000.\n\nThus, the universe had 1/1000 its present radius and the decoupling occurred at 1/1000 of the present age.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep-by-Step (b):\n\nWe wish to show that the work done by the photon gas during an adiabatic expansion from an initial state i to a final state f is given by\n\n  W = (π²/(15 ℏ³c³)) V_i τ_i³ (τ_i – τ_f).\n\nHere is how one derives this result:\n\n1. The pressure of a photon gas is given by\n  P = (1/3) u,\n where u is the energy density. Recall that for black‐body radiation, the energy density is given by\n  u = a τ⁴             (using natural constants)\nwith\n  a = π²/(15 ℏ³ c³).\n\nThus,\n  P = (1/3)a τ⁴.\n\n2. The work done during an expansion is given by the integral\n  W = ∫ P dV.\nSince the photon gas is doing work on its surroundings during expansion this is the work performed by the gas from the initial state (τ_i, V_i) to the final state (τ_f, V_f).\n\n3. Because of the adiabatic invariance, we have\n  τ V^(1/3) = constant = τ_i V_i^(1/3).\nThus, we can express the volume in terms of temperature:\n  V = (τ_i V_i^(1/3)/τ)³ = V_i (τ_i/τ)³.\n\n4. Now, differentiate V with respect to τ:\n  dV/dτ = d/dτ [V_i (τ_i/τ)³] = -3 V_i (τ_i)³/τ⁴.\nSo,\n  dV = -3 V_i (τ_i)³/τ⁴ dτ.\n\n5. Substitute P and dV into the integral for the work:\n  W = ∫_(V_i)^(V_f) P dV = ∫_(τ_i)^(τ_f) P (dV/dτ)dτ.\nReplacing the expressions we found:\n  W = ∫_(τ_i)^(τ_f) (1/3)a τ⁴ · [–3 V_i τ_i³/τ⁴] dτ.\n\nNotice that the factors of 3 and τ⁴ cancel:\n  W = –a V_i τ_i³ ∫_(τ_i)^(τ_f) dτ.\n\nEvaluating the integral gives:\n  W = –a V_i τ_i³ (τ_f – τ_i) = a V_i τ_i³ (τ_i – τ_f).\n\n6. Finally, substituting back for a,\n  a = π²/(15 ℏ³ c³),\nwe obtain the desired result:\n  W = (π²/(15 ℏ³ c³)) V_i τ_i³ (τ_i – τ_f).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers:\n\n(a) The radius of the universe at decoupling was:\n   R_decoupling = (1/1000) R_today.\n  If R ∝ t then decoupling occurred at 1/1000 of the present age.\n\n(b) The work done by the photon gas during the expansion is\n   W = (π²/(15 ℏ³ c³)) V_i τ_i³ (τ_i – τ_f).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer in LaTeX:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\frac{R_{\\text{decoupling}}}{R_{\\text{today}}} = \\frac{3}{3000} = \\frac{1}{1000}, \\quad\\text{so if } R \\propto t,\\quad \\frac{t_{\\text{decoupling}}}{t_{\\text{today}}}=\\frac{1}{1000}.\\\\\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & W = \\frac{\\pi^2}{15\\,\\hbar^3 c^3}\\,V_i\\,\\tau_i^3\\,(\\tau_i-\\tau_f).\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\frac{R_{\\text{decoupling}}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\frac{R_{\\text{decoupling}}", "expr2": "\\frac{R_i}{R_f} = 10^{-3}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\frac{R_{\\text{decoupling}}", "expr2": "\\text{Decoupling occurred at } \\text{10}^{-3} \\text{ of the present age of the universe.}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & \\frac{R_{\\text{decoupling}}", "expr2": "W = \\frac{\\pi^2}{15\\hbar^3c^3}V_i \\tau_i^3 (\\tau_i - \\tau_f)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "Statistical Mechanics/18-2", "solution": "We wish to study an ideal gas of N monoatomic particles. In our model each particle has, besides the usual 3‐dimensional translational degrees of freedom (which are treated classically) an “internal” degree of freedom that may take one of 2 values: 0 or ε.

In what follows we shall often work with quantities per particle and then “put in” a factor N.\n\nBelow is one acceptable solution.

In three dimensions the average translational energy is\n  U_trans = (3/2) kτ,\nso that \n  C_V^(trans) = dU_trans/dτ = (3/2) k.\nThus, for N particles,\n  C_V^(trans) = (3/2) N k.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep (c): Thermodynamics of the Full Ideal Gas\n\nNow the one-particle partition function is a product of translational and internal parts,\n  z = z_trans z_int = (V/λ³)(1 + e^(–βε)).\nSince we are treating an ideal gas the total partition function (including the indistinguishability correction) is\n  Q = z^N/N!.\nThus, one may obtain all the thermodynamic functions from Q.\n\n(i) Chemical Potential, μ\n\nRecall that the free energy is\n  F = –kτ ln Q = –Nkτ ln z + kτ ln (N!).\nUsing Stirling’s approximation for large N we have ln(N!) ≈ N ln N – N and hence\n  F = –Nkτ [ln z – ln N + 1].\nDifferentiating with respect to N (or, more directly, using the standard result for an ideal gas) gives\n  μ = (∂F/∂N)_τ,V = –kτ ln(z/N).\nSince \n  z = (V/λ³)(1+e^(–βε)),\nthis becomes\n  μ = –kτ ln [ (V/(Nλ³)) (1+e^(–ε/(kτ))) ].\n\n(ii) Free Energy, F\n\nAs we already found,\n  F = –Nkτ [ ln z – ln N + 1 ].\nThus, inserting z we have\n  F = –Nkτ { ln [V/(λ³)(1+e^(–ε/(kτ)))] – ln N + 1 }\nor equivalently,\n  F = –Nkτ { ln [V/(Nλ³)] + 1 + ln (1+e^(–ε/(kτ))) }.\n\n(iii) Entropy, S\n\nThe entropy is given by\n  S = –(∂F/∂τ)_V,N.\nSince F splits into a translational and an internal part we may write\n  S = S_trans + S_int.\nIt is well known that for a monoatomic ideal gas\n  S_trans = N k [ ln(V/(Nλ³)) + 5/2 ].\nOn the other hand, the internal free energy is\n  F_int = –Nkτ ln (1+e^(–ε/(kτ))),\nso that \n  S_int = –∂F_int/∂τ = N k [ ln (1+e^(–ε/(kτ))) + (ε/(kτ))· (e^(–ε/(kτ))/(1+e^(–ε/(kτ))) ) ].\nThus, the total entropy is\n  S = Nk [ ln(V/(Nλ³)) + 5/2 + ln (1+e^(–ε/(kτ))) + (ε/(kτ)) ( e^(–ε/(kτ))/(1+e^(–ε/(kτ))) ) ].\n\n(iv) Pressure, P\n\nFor any ideal gas the pressure comes solely from the translational degrees of freedom.

{"id": "Statistical Mechanics/16-4", "solution": "We start with the case of a nonreflective (black) middle plate, and then generalize to the case when the middle plate has a reflectivity r.\n\n───────────────────────────────  \nStep 1. Black (Nonreflective) Middle Plate\n\nConsider three infinite parallel planes:  \n• The top plane is at temperature T₍ᵤ₎.  \n• The bottom plane is at temperature T₍ₗ₎.  \n• A third (middle) black plate is inserted between them, and it comes to a steady‐state temperature T₍ₘ₎.\n\nBecause all bodies are black (emissivity = 1, and they absorb all incident radiation), the radiative energy flux emitted per unit area from a surface at temperature T is given by σ_B T⁴, where σ_B is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe energy flux from the top plate that is incident on the middle plate is σ_B T₍ᵤ₎⁴ and from the middle plate (at T₍ₘ₎) is σ_B T₍ₘ₎⁴. Thus, the net flux from the top plate to the middle plate is\n\n  Flux₍u→m₎ = σ_B (T₍ᵤ₎⁴ – T₍ₘ₎⁴).\n\nSimilarly, the net flux from the middle plate down to the bottom plate is\n\n  Flux₍m→l₎ = σ_B (T₍ₘ₎⁴ – T₍ₗ₎⁴).\n\nSince the middle plate is in a steady state, the power it absorbs from above must equal the power it loses downward. Hence, we require\n\n  σ_B (T₍ᵤ₎⁴ – T₍ₘ₎⁴) = σ_B (T₍ₘ₎⁴ – T₍ₗ₎⁴).\n\nCanceling σ_B gives\n\n  T₍ᵤ₎⁴ – T₍ₘ₎⁴ = T₍ₘ₎⁴ – T₍ₗ₎⁴.\n\nSolving for T₍ₘ₎⁴, we add T₍ₘ₎⁴ to both sides and obtain\n\n  T₍ᵤ₎⁴ + T₍ₗ₎⁴ = 2 T₍ₘ₎⁴,\n\nor\n\n  T₍ₘ₎⁴ = (T₍ᵤ₎⁴ + T₍ₗ₎⁴) / 2.\n\nTaking the fourth root, we have\n\n  T₍ₘ₎ = [(T₍ᵤ₎⁴ + T₍ₗ₎⁴) / 2]^(1/4).\n\nNow, note that without the middle plate, the net flux from the top plate to the bottom plate is\n\n  J₍U₎ = σ_B (T₍ᵤ₎⁴ – T₍ₗ₎⁴).\n\nHowever, with the middle plate inserted, we now have two fluxes: from the top plate to the middle plate, and from the middle plate to the bottom plate. Each of these is\n\n  σ_B (T₍ᵤ₎⁴ – T₍ₘ₎⁴) = σ_B (T₍ₘ₎⁴ – T₍ₗ₎⁴).\n\nUsing the result T₍ₘ₎⁴ = (T₍ᵤ₎⁴ + T₍ₗ₎⁴) / 2, we see that\n\n  T₍ᵤ₎⁴ – T₍ₘ₎⁴ = T₍ᵤ₎⁴ – (T₍ᵤ₎⁴ + T₍ₗ₎⁴)/2 = (T₍ᵤ₎⁴ – T₍ₗ₎⁴)/2.\n\nThus the net flux from the top to the middle (and similarly from the middle to the bottom) is\n\n  (σ_B/2) (T₍ᵤ₎⁴ – T₍ₗ₎⁴).\n\nIn effect, the presence of the middle shield halves the net energy flux compared to the situation without it.\n\n───────────────────────────────  \nStep 2. Middle Plate with Reflectivity r\n\nNow, let the middle plane have a reflectivity r. According to Kirchhoff’s law, the emissivity e of a body equals its absorptivity, and for a plane with reflectivity r (with no transmission), we have\n\n  e = 1 – r.\n\nThat is, when radiation is incident on the middle plate, only a fraction (1 – r) is effectively absorbed (and later emitted thermally according to its temperature), while a fraction r is reflected.\n\nNow, when the top plate radiates σ_B T₍ᵤ₎⁴ toward the middle plate, only a fraction (1 – r) is absorbed, and similarly on the other side. In steady state, the net energy flux absorbed by the middle plate from the top is\n\n  (1 – r) [σ_B (T₍ᵤ₎⁴ – T₍ₘ₎⁴)],\n\nand that leaving it toward the bottom is\n\n  (1 – r) [σ_B (T₍ₘ₎⁴ – T₍ₗ₎⁴)].\n\nRequiring that the middle plate remains in a steady state (no net heat accumulation) we again set\n\n  (1 – r) [σ_B (T₍ᵤ₎⁴ – T₍ₘ₎⁴)] = (1 – r) [σ_B (T₍ₘ₎⁴ – T₍ₗ₎⁴)].\n\nSince (1 – r) and σ_B are nonzero factors, they cancel from both sides, and the condition for T₍ₘ₎ remains\n\n  T₍ᵤ₎⁴ – T₍ₘ₎⁴ = T₍ₘ₎⁴ – T₍ₗ₎⁴,\n  T₍ₘ₎⁴ = (T₍ᵤ₎⁴ + T₍ₗ₎⁴)/2,\n  T₍ₘ₎ = [ (T₍ᵤ₎⁴ + T₍ₗ₎⁴)/2 ]^(1/4).\n\nThus, the steady state temperature of the middle plate is the same as in the nonreflective case.\n\nHowever, the net flux transmitted from the top to the middle (and from the middle to the bottom) now becomes multiplied by the factor (1 – r):\n\n  Flux₍u→m₎ = (1 – r) [σ_B (T₍ᵤ₎⁴ – T₍ₘ₎⁴)].\n\nInserting T₍ᵤ₎⁴ – T₍ₘ₎⁴ = (T₍ᵤ₎⁴ – T₍ₗ₎⁴)/2 gives\n\n  Flux₍u→m₎ = (1 – r) (σ_B/2) (T₍ᵤ₎⁴ – T₍ₗ₎⁴).\n\nThus the net flux is reduced by a factor of (1 – r) relative to the black (r = 0) case.\n\n───────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answers\n\n1. For a black (nonreflective) middle plane:  \n  The steady state temperature is  \n    T₍ₘ₎ = [ (T₍ᵤ₎⁴ + T₍ₗ₎⁴)/2 ]^(1/4),  \n  and the net energy flux (both from top to middle and middle to bottom) is  \n    J₍net₎ = (σ_B/2) (T₍ᵤ₎⁴ – T₍ₗ₎⁴).\n\n2.

In part (a) we follow the two‐step thermodynamic process of the nitrogen gas and, in part (b) we study two very different “collision” problems.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPart (a): Nitrogen Gas Process\n\nWe are given:\n• n = 2.0 mol of N₂ (assume at room temperature the diatomic molecule has 5 degrees‐of‐freedom so that Cᵥ = (5/2)R),\n• Initial temperature Tₐ = 27.0 °C = 300 K,\n• Initial volume Vₐ = 0.020 m³.\n\nThe process is done in two steps:\n1. A constant–pressure expansion from state A to state B until the volume doubles:\n  V_B = 2Vₐ = 0.040 m³.\n2. An adiabatic expansion from state B to state C, chosen so that the final temperature returns to 300 K.\n\nLet’s denote the three states as A, B, and C.\n\nStep 1. (A → B) at constant pressure:\n• The pressure in state A is given by the ideal‐gas law:\n  P = (nRTₐ)/Vₐ = (2·8.314·300)/0.020 ≈ 2.49×10⁵ Pa.\n• Since pressure is constant, the temperature scales with volume. Thus the temperature state B is:\n  T_B = Tₐ (V_B/Vₐ) = 300 × 2 = 600 K.\n• The work done in a constant–pressure process is\n  W₁ = P (V_B – Vₐ) = 2.49×10⁵ × (0.040 – 0.020) = 2.49×10⁵×0.020 ≈ 4.99×10³ J.\n• The change in internal energy in this step is\n  ΔU₁ = n Cᵥ (T_B – Tₐ) = 2 × (5/2 R) (600 – 300)\n      = 2 × ( (5×8.314)/2 )×300 ≈ 2 × 20.785×300 ≈ 12471 J.\n• So the heat added in step 1 (from the 1st law Q = ΔU + W) is\n  Q₁ = ΔU₁ + W₁ ≈ 12471 + 4990 ≈ 17461 J.\n\nStep 2.

Thus,\n  V_C^(γ–1) = (T_B/T_C) V_B^(γ–1) ⟹ V_C = V_B × (T_B/T_C)^(1/(γ–1)).\nSince T_B/T_C = 600/300 = 2 and γ–1 = 0.4, we have\n  V_C = 0.040 × 2^(1/0.4) = 0.040 × 2^(2.5).\nNow, 2^(2.5) = 2^(5/2) = √(2^5) = √32 ≈ 5.657.\nThus,\n  V_C ≈ 0.040 × 5.657 ≈ 0.2263 m³.\n\nDuring the adiabatic process the change in internal energy is\n  ΔU₂ = n Cᵥ (T_C – T_B) = 2 × (5/2×8.314) (300 – 600)\n      ≈ 2 × 20.785 × (–300) = –12471 J.\nSince Q₂ = 0 (adiabatic), the work done in step 2 is given by\n  W₂ = –ΔU₂ = 12471 J.\n\nNow we summarize the overall changes for part (a):\n\n(i) Diagram in the P–V Plane:\n – Point A: (Vₐ = 0.020 m³, P ≈ 2.49×10⁵ Pa).\n – Then a horizontal line (constant pressure) to point B: (V_B = 0.040 m³, P ≈ 2.49×10⁵ Pa).\n – Then from B to C, an adiabatic (curved) path, ending at point C with (V_C ≈ 0.226 m³, P lower so that T returns to 300 K).\n\n(ii) Total change in the internal energy:\nSince the final and initial temperatures are the same,\n  ΔU_total = ΔU₁ + ΔU₂ = 12471 J – 12471 J = 0 J.\n\n(iii) Total work done by the gas:\n  W_total = W₁ + W₂ ≈ 4990 J + 12471 J ≈ 17461 J.\n\n(iv) Total heat supplied:\nSince ΔU_total = 0 = Q_total – W_total ⟹ Q_total = W_total ≈ 17461 J.\n\n(v) Final volume:\n  V_C ≈ 0.226 m³.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPart (b): Entropy Changes in Collisions\n\n(b)(i) Two Cars Colliding:\nWe are told that two 1200-kg cars, each travelling at 80 km/h in opposite directions, collide and are brought to rest. Let us first convert 80 km/h to m/s:\n  80 km/h = 80,000 m / 3600 s ≈ 22.22 m/s.\n\nThe kinetic energy of one car is:\n  KE = (1/2) m v² = 0.5 × 1200 × (22.22)².\nCalculate (22.22)²:\n  (22.22)² ≈ 493.83.\nThus,\n  KE ≈ 0.5 × 1200 × 493.83 ≈ 600 × 493.83 ≈ 296298 J.\nThe total kinetic energy (both cars) which is “lost” (i.e. converted to heat in an irreversible collision) is:\n  KE_total = 2 × 296298 J ≈ 592596 J.\nAssuming that all this energy is eventually dispersed as heat into a reservoir at T = 20 °C = 293 K, the entropy change of the universe is approximately\n  ΔS = Q/T ≈ 592596 J / 293 K ≈ 2023 J/K.\nThus, the entropy of the universe increases by roughly 2.0×10³ J/K.\n\n(b)(ii) Al Cup and Hot Water Mixing:\nWe have an insulated aluminum cup and water which come into thermal equilibrium.\nData:\n – Mass of Al, m_Al = 130 g = 0.130 kg, specific heat c_Al = 900 J/(kg·°C)\n – Mass of water, m_w = 210 g = 0.210 kg, specific heat c_w = 4186 J/(kg·°C)\n – Initial temperatures: T_Al,i = 20 °C and T_w,i = 90 °C.\nBecause the cup and water are insulated from the surroundings, energy is conserved.\nLet T_f be the final equilibrium temperature. Energy conservation gives:\n  m_Al c_Al (T_f – 20) = m_w c_w (90 – T_f)\nSubstitute the numbers:\n  0.130 × 900 (T_f – 20) = 0.210 × 4186 (90 – T_f)\nCalculate the coefficients:\n  Left side: 0.130×900 = 117 J/°C,\n  Right side: 0.210×4186 ≈ 879 J/°C.\nThus,\n  117 (T_f – 20) = 879 (90 – T_f).\nSolve:\n  117T_f – 2340 = 79110 – 879T_f,\n  117T_f + 879T_f = 79110 + 2340,\n  996T_f = 81450,\n  T_f ≈ 81.8 °C.\nNow, we calculate the entropy changes for each part. It is best to use absolute temperature (in Kelvin).\nFor water:\n  T_w,i = 90 + 273.15 = 363.15 K,\n  T_f = 81.8 + 273.15 = 354.95 K.\nEntropy change for water:\n  ΔS_water = m_w c_w ln(T_f/T_w,i)\n      ≈ 0.210×4186×ln(354.95/363.15).\nFirst, ln(354.95/363.15) = ln(0.9787) ≈ –0.0215.\nThus,\n  ΔS_water ≈ 0.210×4186×(–0.0215) ≈ –18.9 J/K.\nFor the aluminum cup:\n  T_Al,i = 20 + 273.15 = 293.15 K,\n  T_f = 354.95 K.\nEntropy change for Al:\n  ΔS_Al = m_Al c_Al ln(T_f/T_Al,i)\n      ≈ 0.130×900×ln(354.95/293.15).\nCalculate: 0.130×900 = 117 J/°C.\nThen ln(354.95/293.15) = ln(1.212) ≈ 0.192.\nThus,\n  ΔS_Al ≈ 117×0.192 ≈ 22.5 J/K.\nThe total entropy change for the system is:\n  ΔS_total = ΔS_water + ΔS_Al ≈ (–18.9) + 22.5 ≈ +3.6

As the rock cools from an initial temperature Tᵢ to a final temperature T_f, we can extract work from the differential heat dQ removed from the rock, with efficiency η = 1 – (Tₐ/T).\n\nStep 1.

{"id": "Statistical Mechanics/17-1", "solution": "We will show that one way to estimate the maximum height hₘₐₓ to which water can rise (by capillarity/transpiration pull) is by using the Kelvin “equation” that relates a water‐potential difference (a difference in chemical potential) to a change in pressure via gravity.\n\nStep 1. The Kelvin equation (written in terms of pressures) tells us that when water is in equilibrium with its vapor the relative humidity r is given by\n\n  ln(r) = – (Δp · vₘ)/(RT),\n\nwhere\n  • r is the relative humidity (here r = 0.9),\n  • Δp is the pressure difference between the water in the pool (where the air is saturated, r = 1) and that near the leaves,\n  • vₘ is the molar volume of liquid water,\n  • R is the gas constant, and\n  • T is the absolute temperature.\n\nStep 2. In our simple picture the negative pressure necessary to “pull” water up a tree must balance the gravitational pressure drop:\n  Δp = ρ g h,\nwhere ρ is the density of water (≈ 1000 kg/m³) and g is the acceleration due to gravity (≈ 9.8 m/s²).\n\nStep 3. Inserting Δp = ρ g h into the Kelvin equation gives\n\n  ln(r) = – (ρ g h · vₘ)/(RT).\n\nSolving for h we find\n\n  h = – (RT/(ρ g vₘ)) ln(r) = (RT/(ρ g vₘ)) ln(1/r).\n\nStep 4. To get a number we must use\n  R = 8.314 J/(mol·K),\n  T = 25°C + 273.15 ≈ 298 K,\n  vₘ = (molar mass of water)/(density of water). Since the molar mass of water is 18×10⁻³ kg/mol, we have\n\n  vₘ = (18×10⁻³ kg/mol) / (1000 kg/m³) = 1.8×10⁻⁵ m³/mol.\n\nNow substitute the numbers into the above expression:\n\n  h = (8.314 · 298)/(1000 · 9.8 · 1.8×10⁻⁵) ln(1/0.9).\n\nLet’s compute the numerical factors step by step.\n\n(a) Compute the numerator:\n  8.314 × 298 ≈ 2477.7 J/mol.\n\n(b) Compute the denominator:\n  1000 × 9.8 × 1.8×10⁻⁵ = 9.8 × 0.018 = 0.1764.\n\nThus,\n  h = (2477.7/0.1764) × ln(1/0.9).\n\n(c) Note that ln(1/0.9) = –ln(0.9) ≈ 0.10536.\n\nSo we have\n  h ≈ (2477.7/0.1764) × 0.10536.\n\nNow calculate 2477.7/0.1764:\n  2477.7 / 0.1764 ≈ 14039.\n\nThen multiply by 0.10536:\n  h ≈ 14039 × 0.10536 ≈ 1479 m.\n\nStep 5.

This suggests that while the Kelvin effect sets one limit, other constraints (such as the mechanics of water transport in living tissues, embolism, and others) play important roles in limiting the actual height of trees.\n\nFinal Answer\n\nThe maximum height is given by\n\n  hₘₐₓ = (RT/(ρg vₘ)) ln(1/r),\n\nwhich, for T = 298 K, r = 0.9, ρ = 1000 kg/m³, g = 9.8 m/s², and vₘ = 1.8×10⁻⁵ m³/mol, evaluates to approximately 1.48×10³ m.\n\nThus, the final answer is\n\n  \\[\n\\boxed{h_{\\rm max} = \\frac{RT}{\\rho g\\,v_m}\\ln\\frac{1}{r} \\approx 1.5\\times10^3\\ \\text{m}.}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["h_{\\rm max} = \\frac{RT}{\\rho g\\,v_m}\\ln\\frac{1}{r} \\approx 1.5\\times10^3\\ \\text{m}."], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "h_{\\rm max} = \\frac{RT}{\\rho g\\,v_m}\\ln\\frac{1}{r} \\approx 1.5\\times10^3\\ \\text{m}.", "expr2": "h = \\frac{\\tau}{mg} \\log\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\approx 1.5 \\, \\text{km}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

However, there is a restriction: link number s can be open only if all links 1, 2, …, s – 1 are open. Therefore, the only allowed configurations consist of a contiguous block of open links from the left. For example, if m links are open (with m = 0, 1, …, N), the leftmost m links are open and the remaining N – m links are closed. The energy of such a configuration is simply mε.\n\nLet τ denote the temperature (or, more generally, k_BT if you wish to include Boltzmann’s constant, but here we treat τ as the thermal energy scale).\n\nStep (a): Calculate the partition function.\n\nFor each allowed configuration with m open links, the Boltzmann weight is\n  exp⁡(–mε/τ).\n\nSince m can take any integer value from 0 to N, the partition function is:\n  Z = Σₘ₌₀ᴺ exp(–mε/τ).\n\nDefining q = exp(–ε/τ), we have:\n  Z = Σₘ₌₀ᴺ qᵐ = 1 + q + q² + … + qᴺ.\n\nThis is a finite geometric series, which can be summed as:\n  Z = (1 – q^(N+1))/(1 – q)\nor, equivalently,\n  Z = [1 – exp(–(N+1)ε/τ)]/[1 – exp(–ε/τ)].\n\nStep (b): Find the average number of open links in the limit ε >> τ.\n\nThe average number of open links ⟨m⟩ is given by\n  ⟨m⟩ = (1/Z) Σₘ₌₀ᴺ m exp(–mε/τ).\n\nIn the limit ε >> τ, the parameter q = exp(–ε/τ) becomes very small (q << 1).

{"id": "Statistical Mechanics/15-3", "solution": "We will solve the problem step‐by‐step.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (a): One spin\n\nA spin‑1/2 in a magnetic field has two energy levels. (In what follows we use τ to denote kT so that β = 1/τ.) In our problem the energies are given by\n\n  ε₊ = –μB   (for a spin pointing along the field)\n  ε₋ = +μB   (for a spin pointing opposite to the field).\n\nThe single‐spin partition function is therefore\n\n  z = exp(–β ε₊) + exp(–β ε₋)\n     = exp(+β μB) + exp(–β μB)\n     = 2 cosh(β μB).\n\nThus,\n  z = 2 cosh(μB/τ).\n\nThe probability that a spin is in the state with energy ε (with the Boltzmann factor exp(–βε)) is\n  p = exp(–β ε) / z.\nHence,\n  p(along) = exp(β μB) / [2 cosh(β μB)],\n  p(opposite) = exp(–β μB) / [2 cosh(β μB)].\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (b): Total magnetic moment and high‑temperature limit\n\nEach spin carries a magnetic moment μ. Thus if a given spin is “up” (along the field) its moment is +μ and if it is “down” it is –μ. The average moment for one spin is then\n\n  ⟨m⟩ = μ [p(along) – p(opposite)]\n     = μ [exp(β μB) – exp(–β μB)] / [2 cosh(β μB)]\n     = μ tanh(β μB).\n\nFor a collection of Nₛ independent (and distinguishable) spins the total moment is\n\n  M = Nₛ μ tanh(μB/τ).\n\nNow, “high temperature” means that the thermal energy is large compared to the splitting μB. In other words, when\n\n  μB ≪ τ    (remember that τ = kT).\n\nIn that case we may expand the hyperbolic tangent. Since for small x,\n  tanh(x) ≈ x,\nwe have\n\n  M ≈ Nₛ μ (μB/τ) = Nₛ μ²B/τ.\n\nThus the magnetic susceptibility, defined by\n\n  χ = M/B,\nbecomes\n\n  χ ≈ Nₛ μ²/τ,\n\nwhich is Curie’s law.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (c): Entropy of the Spins at High Temperature\n\nThe spin entropy may be obtained from the partition function or, equivalently, by calculating the Shannon entropy from the probabilities. We outline here the derivation based on the partition function.\n\nFor one spin the partition function is\n  z = 2 cosh(x)   with x = μB/τ.\nFor small x (i.e. high temperature) we have\n  cosh(x) ≈ 1 + x²/2,\nso\n  ln z = ln[2 cosh(x)] ≈ ln 2 + x²/2 = ln 2 + (μB)²/(2τ²).\n\nThe “entropic function” for one spin (in units of k) is\n  σ = ln z + βU,\nwhere the internal energy is given by\n  U = –∂(ln z)/∂β.\nRather than re‐deriving U, one may also use a small–perturbation expansion of the Shannon entropy. Notice that with probabilities\n  p₊ = 1/2 + a  and  p₋ = 1/2 – a  with a = μB/(2τ)\n(one easily checks that these are just the expansion of the earlier probabilities to first order in μB/τ),\na short calculation gives the entropy per spin\n  S_spin/k = ln 2 – 2a² = ln2 – (μB)²/(2τ²).\n\nThus, for Nₛ spins the total entropy is\n\n  σₛ = Sₛ/k = Nₛ (ln2 – μ²B²/(2τ²)).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep (d): Coupling the Spins to a Phonon Gas and the Final Temperature\n\nNow we imagine that the spins are coupled to a phonon (lattice vibration) bath in an insulating crystal that is at the same temperature τ. (The phonon “entropy” in the Debye model is given by)\n  σ_p = S_p/k = (4π⁴/5) N_p (τ/τ_D)³,\nwhere N_p is the number of lattice atoms and τ_D is the Debye temperature.\n\nInitially the entire system (spins + phonons) is at temperature τ and is coupled so that it is in equilibrium. In the presence of a magnetic field B the spin entropy is\n  σₛ(i) = Nₛ (ln2 – μ²B²/(2τ²)).\nWhen we “remove the field” (i.e. reduce B to zero) the spins become fully disordered so that their entropy increases to\n  σₛ(f) = Nₛ ln 2.\nThus the spin entropy increases by\n\n  Δσₛ = Nₛ ln2 – Nₛ (ln2 – μ²B²/(2τ²)) = Nₛ μ²B²/(2τ²).\n\nNow, suppose that after “isolating” the full system (so that no heat is exchanged with the external environment) we slowly reduce B to zero. Since the process is adiabatic (no heat exchange with the surroundings), the total entropy remains constant. Therefore any increase in the spin entropy must be offset by a decrease in the phonon entropy. In other words, if the final temperature is τ_f the phonon system (which has many degrees of freedom) will lose an amount of entropy\n\n  Δσ_p = σ_p(f) – σ_p(i)\n     = (4π⁴/5) N_p (τ_f³ – τ³)/τ_D³.\n\nConservation of the total (dimensionless) entropy then requires\n\n  (4π⁴/5) N_p (τ_f³ – τ³)/τ_D³ = – Nₛ μ²B²/(2τ²).\n\nThus\n\n  τ_f³ – τ³ = – (5 Nₛ μ²B² τ_D³) / (8π⁴ N_p τ²).\n\nIn many cases N_p ≫ Nₛ so that the fractional change in T is small. One may then write\n\n  τ_f = τ – Δτ  with\n  τ³ – (τ – Δτ)³ ≈ 3τ² Δτ.\nThus,\n  3τ² Δτ ≈ (5 Nₛ μ²B² τ_D³) / (8π⁴ N_p τ²),\nor\n  Δτ ≈ (5 Nₛ μ²B² τ_D³) / (24π⁴ N_p τ⁴).\n\nIn other words, the removal of the magnetic field causes the spins to “regain” the full value of ln2 in entropy per spin. Since the total system is isolated, the extra entropy must be “paid for” by cooling the phonons, so the final temperature is lowered from τ to approximately\n\n  τ_f³ = τ³ – (5 Nₛ μ²B² τ_D³)/(8π⁴ N_p τ²)\n  or, to first order,\n  τ_f ≈ τ – (5 Nₛ μ²B² τ_D³)/(24π⁴ N_p τ⁴).\n\nThat is, when the field is reduced to zero the extra spin entropy is “borrowed” from the phonons and the system cools slightly.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The single‐spin partition function is \n  z = 2 cosh(μB/τ),\nwith probabilities\n  p(along) = exp(μB/τ)/[2 cosh(μB/τ)]  and  p(opposite) = exp(–μB/τ)/[2 cosh(μB/τ)].\n\n(b) The total moment is \n  M = Nₛ μ tanh(μB/τ). \nFor μB ≪ τ (“high temperature”) we have \n  M ≈ Nₛ μ² B/τ  so  χ = M/B ≈ Nₛ μ²/τ  (Curie’s law).\n\n(c) At high temperature the spin entropy is \n  σₛ = Sₛ/k = Nₛ (ln2 – μ²B²/(2τ²)).\n\n(d) When the spins (initially at temperature τ and under a magnetic field) are coupled to a phonon gas and then isolated, reducing B to 0 causes the spin entropy to increase by Δσₛ = Nₛ μ²B²/(2τ²). Since the total entropy is conserved, the phonon entropy decreases by this amount, leading to a final temperature τ_f given by\n\n  (4π⁴/5) N_p [(τ_f³ – τ³)/τ_D³] = – Nₛ μ²B²/(2τ²),\nor\n  τ_f³ = τ³ – (5Nₛ μ²B²τ_D³)/(8π⁴N_pτ²).\n\nFor small changes one may write\n  τ_f ≈ τ – (5Nₛ μ²B²τ_D³)/(24π⁴N_pτ⁴).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & z = 2\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\mu B}{\\tau}\\right),\\quad \np_+ = \\frac{e^{\\mu B/\\tau}}{2\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\mu B}{\\tau}\\right)},\\quad \np_- = \\frac{e^{-\\mu B/\\tau}}{2\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\mu B}{\\tau}\\right)}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & M = N_s\\mu\\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\mu B}{\\tau}\\right),\\quad \\text{and for } \\mu B\\ll\\tau,\\quad M\\approx N_s\\frac{\\mu^2B}{\\tau}\\quad (\\chi\\simeq N_s\\mu^2/\\tau).\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\sigma_s = \\frac{S_s}{k} = N_s\\left[\\ln2-\\frac{\\mu^2B^2}{2\\tau^2}\\right].\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad & \\frac{4\\pi^4}{5}N_p\\left(\\frac{\\tau_f^3-\\tau^3}{\\tau_D^3}\\right)\n=-\\frac{N_s\\mu^2B^2}{2\\tau^2},\\quad\\text{so that}\\\\[1mm]\n& \\tau_f^3= \\tau^3-\\frac{5N_s\\mu^2B^2\\tau_D^3}{8\\pi^4N_p\\tau^2},\\\\[1mm]\n& \\text{or approximately,}\\quad \\tau_f\\approx \\tau-\\frac{5N_s\\mu^2B^2\\tau_D^3}{24\\pi^4N_p\\tau^4}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & z = 2\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\mu B}{\\tau}\\right),\\quad \np_+ = \\frac{e^{\\mu B/\\tau}}{2\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\mu B}{\\tau}\\right)},\\quad \np_- = \\frac{e^{-\\mu B/\\tau}}{2\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\mu B}{\\tau}\\right)}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & M = N_s\\mu\\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\mu B}{\\tau}\\right),\\quad \\text{and for } \\mu B\\ll\\tau,\\quad M\\approx N_s\\frac{\\mu^2B}{\\tau}\\quad (\\chi\\simeq N_s\\mu^2/\\tau).\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\sigma_s = \\frac{S_s}{k} = N_s\\left[\\ln2-\\frac{\\mu^2B^2}{2\\tau^2}\\right].\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad & \\frac{4\\pi^4}{5}N_p\\left(\\frac{\\tau_f^3-\\tau^3}{\\tau_D^3}\\right)\n=-\\frac{N_s\\mu^2B^2}{2\\tau^2},\\quad\\text{so that}\\\\[1mm]\n& \\tau_f^3= \\tau^3-\\frac{5N_s\\mu^2B^2\\tau_D^3}{8\\pi^4N_p\\tau^2},\\\\[1mm]\n& \\text{or approximately,}\\quad \\tau_f\\approx \\tau-\\frac{5N_s\\mu^2B^2\\tau_D^3}{24\\pi^4N_p\\tau^4}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad & z = 2\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\mu B}{\\tau}\\right),\\quad \np_+ = \\frac{e^{\\mu B/\\tau}}{2\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\mu B}{\\tau}\\right)},\\quad \np_- = \\frac{e^{-\\mu B/\\tau}}{2\\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\mu B}{\\tau}\\right)}.\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad & M = N_s\\mu\\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\mu B}{\\tau}\\right),\\quad \\text{and for } \\mu B\\ll\\tau,\\quad M\\approx N_s\\frac{\\mu^2B}{\\tau}\\quad (\\chi\\simeq N_s\\mu^2/\\tau).\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(c)}\\quad & \\sigma_s = \\frac{S_s}{k} = N_s\\left[\\ln2-\\frac{\\mu^2B^2}{2\\tau^2}\\right].\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(d)}\\quad & \\frac{4\\pi^4}{5}N_p\\left(\\frac{\\tau_f^3-\\tau^3}{\\tau_D^3}\\right)\n=-\\frac{N_s\\mu^2B^2}{2\\tau^2},\\quad\\text{so that}\\\\[1mm]\n& \\tau_f^3= \\tau^3-\\frac{5N_s\\mu^2B^2\\tau_D^3}{8\\pi^4N_p\\tau^2},\\\\[1mm]\n& \\text{or approximately,}\\quad \\tau_f\\approx \\tau-\\frac{5N_s\\mu^2B^2\\tau_D^3}{24\\pi^4N_p\\tau^4}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "Z_1 = 2 \\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\mu B}{\\tau}\\right)"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}], "accuracy": 1.0}

In d–dimensions the potential is\n\n  V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r²,\nso that the single–particle energies (apart from an irrelevant zero–point shift) follow (for large quantum numbers) the eigenvalue equation\n\n  E ≈ ℏω (n₁ + n₂ + ... + n_d).\n  \nIn the semiclassical approximation the density of states is given by the available phase–space volume, and one finds\n\n  g(E) = E^(d–1)/( (ℏω)^d Γ(d) ).      (4)\n\n(To be precise, one obtains g(E) dE = (1/(ℏω)^d)(E^(d–1)/Γ(d)) dE.) \n\nNow, repeating the same steps as before but with (4) we have\n\n  N = ∫₀^∞ g(E)dE/(e^(βE) – 1)\n    = 1/(ℏω)^d (kT)^(d) ∫₀^∞ [x^(d–1)/(e^x – 1)] dx\n    = (kT)^d/( (ℏω)^d ) Γ(d) ζ(d) / Γ(d),  \n    = (kT)^d/( (ℏω)^d ) ζ(d).\n\nThus at T = T_c we have\n\n  N = (kT_c)^d/( (ℏω)^d ) ζ(d).\n\nThis gives\n\n  kT_c = ℏω [N/ζ(d)]^(1/d).      (5)\n\nNote that while in the homogeneous system condensation can occur only for d > 2, in the harmonic trap the density–of–states (4) is “softer” (g(E) ~ E^(d–1)), and one finds that condensation occurs provided ζ(d) is finite – which in general is the case for d > 1. (For example, in the standard three–dimensional harmonic trap, d = 3, ζ(3) is finite. In one–dimension ζ(1) diverges so that one does not expect a conventional BEC in a 1D harmonic trap.) In other words, the trapping potential tends to facilitate condensation by “piling up” many states near the ground state.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) For a Bose gas in a d–dimensional hypercube of side L, the density of states is\n\n  In momentum space:\n   g(p) dp = [L^d/(2π)^d] [2π^(d/2)/Γ(d/2)] p^(d–1) dp.\n  In energy space:\n   g(E) = L^d (2m)^(d/2)/( (4π)^(d/2) Γ(d/2) ) E^(d/2 – 1).\n\n(b) For the free gas with chemical potential μ → 0 at T_c, one finds\n\n  N = L^d (2m kT_c)^(d/2)/( (4π)^(d/2) ) ζ(d/2)\n  ⇒ kT_c = [ (N/L^d) (4π)^(d/2)/( (2m)^(d/2) ζ(d/2) ) ]^(2/d).\nNote that since ζ(d/2) diverges for d/2 ≤ 1 (i.e. for d ≤ 2), condensation occurs only for d > 2.\n\n(c) When the gas is placed in an external isotropic harmonic potential of characteristic frequency ω the density of states becomes\n\n  g(E) = E^(d–1)/( (ℏω)^d Γ(d) ).\nIn this case, the number of particles is\n\n  N = (kT_c)^d/( (ℏω)^d ) ζ(d)\n  ⇒ kT_c = ℏω [N/ζ(d)]^(1/d).\nThus the trap tends to facilitate condensation (by “piling up” states near the ground state) and, in particular, condensation occurs provided ζ(d) is finite (which is true for d > 1).\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\;

{"id": "Statistical Mechanics/21-3", "solution": "We shall show step‐by‐step how to obtain the answers.\n\nLet the state variables (temperature and pressure) on the saturation curve be denoted by T and p₀. Suppose that at state 1 the system is at (T, p₀, V) and that during the process 1 → 2 a total of n moles of liquid evaporate. (In most liquids vₗ is very small compared with the gas molar volume v_g; however, we shall keep both.)\n\nStep 1. (Process 1 → 2: Isothermal Evaporation)  \nAt constant temperature T and pressure p₀ the liquid evaporates. The molar latent heat is L_v. Hence, the total heat absorbed is\n\n  Q_in = n L_v.\n\nAlso, the evaporation leads to an increase in volume by\n\n  ΔV_evap = n (v_g – vₗ).\n\nStep 2. (Processes 2 → 3 → 4 → 1: The Carnot Cycle)  \nAfter evaporation, the system undergoes a reversible cooling from T to T – ΔT (process 2 → 3), then an isothermal compression at temperature T – ΔT (process 3 → 4) during which the vapor is recombined into liquid (removing n moles), and finally a reversible heating from T – ΔT back to T. (It is important that the whole cycle is reversible and that the working substance is the same. A basic fact about Carnot cycles is that for any two heat engines operating between the same two temperatures the efficiency can only depend upon T and T – ΔT. In the small ΔT limit this means that the efficiency must be ΔT/T independently of the details of the substance.)\n\nStep 3. (Calculating the Net Work)  \nDuring the evaporation at T (process 1 → 2) the system expands; it does work equal to\n\n  W₁→₂ = p₀·ΔV_evap = p₀ n (v_g – vₗ).\n\nLater, during the isothermal compression at T – ΔT (process 3 → 4) the system is compressed while being maintained at the lower temperature. At state 3 the pressure is very nearly the vapor pressure at T – ΔT, that is p_v(T – ΔT). In the process 3 → 4 the vapor is compressed from a volume larger by n (v_g – vₗ) while the pressure is reduced approximately by Δp. (You may picture the 1–2 leg and the 3–4 leg as horizontal “lines” in a p–V diagram that differ by Δp in pressure.) Therefore, the work done during the compression is approximately\n\n  W₃→₄ = (p_v – Δp) · [n (v_g – vₗ)].\n\nThus, the net work done by the cycle is the difference between the work gained in the expansion and that lost during the compression:\n  W_net = W₁→₂ – W₃→₄ ≈ n (v_g – vₗ) [p₀ – (p_v – Δp)].\n\nSince p₀ is the vapor pressure at T and p_v = p₀ (because the evaporation and condensation occur along the saturation curve) we have\n  W_net ≈ n (v_g – vₗ) Δp.\n\nStep 4.

{"id": "Statistical Mechanics/21-5", "solution": "We will analyze each part step by step.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n(a) Open Bottle Immersed in Boiling Water\n\nImagine a pure‐water bottle that is open to the atmosphere. With the bottle immersed in a pot of boiling water, the glass (even if very thin) will be heated by the 100°C water outside. One might expect that the water inside would also reach 100°C and, therefore, boil. However, there are two points to note:\n\n1. Because the container is open, its internal pressure remains equal to atmospheric pressure. At 1 atm, water boils at 100°C.  \n2. In “pure” water there are often very few nucleation sites for vapor bubbles (if the water has been carefully purified and de‐aerated); even when the temperature is near 100°C, spontaneous nucleation may be inhibited. This state is called “superheating.” In practice, without vigorous nucleation (or disturbances), the water may heat up to 100°C (or even a bit above) and yet not produce vigorous boiling.\n\nThus, although the bottle’s walls are heated to nearly 100°C by the boiling water bath, the water inside does not necessarily “boil vigorously” because it lacks the disturbances or nuclei needed to initiate bubble formation. In many cases one observes little if any bubbling, or only sudden “explosive” boiling if the superheated water is disturbed.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n(b) Corking the Bottle While Boiling\n\nNow, suppose by some means you manage to initiate boiling in the small bottle and almost immediately seal it with a cork. What happens next?\n\n– When the water is boiling in an open situation, the boiling process is regulated by the constant external (atmospheric) pressure.  \n– In a closed container the vapor generated is trapped. As boiling proceeds, water vapor accumulates above the liquid, and its pressure increases.  \n– An increased vapor pressure inside the bottle means that the liquid must be hotter to sustain boiling (since the saturation temperature rises with pressure). At the same time, the evaporation process draws latent heat from the liquid, cooling it.  \n– As a result, the water cools below the new boiling point (which itself has been raised by the increasing pressure), and boiling eventually ceases.\n\nEven if thermal exchange with the surroundings is minimized, the water–vapor system in the sealed bottle comes to a new equilibrium state (with a slightly higher pressure and a lower liquid temperature than needed for continued boiling). Hence, the boiling stops.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \n(c) Restarting Boiling: Cold Water vs. Boiling Water on the Corked Bottle\n\nAfter the boiling has ceased in the corked bottle, one might try to “re-start” the boiling by pouring water on the outside of the bottle. There are two choices:\n\n• Pour boiling water on the bottle.  \n• Pour cold water on the bottle.\n\nLet’s analyze the effects:\n\n• Pouring boiling water on the corked bottle will keep the bottle (and hence the inner contents) at a high temperature, and importantly it will help maintain or even further increase the internal vapor pressure. Then the saturation (boiling) temperature remains high, so the liquid inside stays below its boiling threshold relative to its pressure.\n\n• In contrast, pouring cold water on the outside of the bottle cools the glass. This cooling has two consequences:\n  – It lowers the temperature of the inner wall, causing some of the vapor in the headspace to condense.  \n  – This condensation reduces the internal vapor pressure.\nReducing the pressure inside the bottle lowers the boiling point of the liquid. If the water in the bottle still has a high enough temperature (or if some energy remains available), the new conditions can become favorable for resuming boiling.\n\nThus, if one’s goal is to restart the boiling, it is advantageous to pour cold water on the bottle.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answers in Summary\n\n(a) The water in an open bottle immersed in boiling water may reach nearly 100°C but will not necessarily boil vigorously because of the absence of nucleation sites; superheating can occur in very pure water.\n\n(b) When the bottle is corked after boiling begins, vapor accumulates and raises the internal pressure, while evaporation cools the remaining water. This shifts the equilibrium so that the temperature falls below the new boiling point, and boiling ceases.\n\n(c) To reinitiate boiling, you would pour cold water over the bottle. The cold water cools the bottle walls, condensing vapor and lowering the internal pressure, thereby lowering the boiling point and favoring the restart of boiling.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&(a) \\text{ In an open bottle immersed in boiling water, the water may heat close to 100°C but does not boil vigorously due to the absence of nucleation sites (superheating).} \\\\\n&(b) \\text{ When the bottle is corked, the trapped vapor increases the internal pressure and cooling by latent heat causes the water temperature to fall below the (raised) boiling point, so boiling ceases.} \\\\\n&(c) \\text{ To restart boiling, one should pour cold water on the bottle.

{"id": "Statistical Mechanics/21-2", "solution": "We begin by noting that our cooling comes from evaporating liquid ⁴He. In equilibrium, the heat that flows into the liquid (Q joules per second) is exactly balanced by the latent heat L (per mole) needed to evaporate the liquid. The evaporation produces a certain (molar) flow rate of helium vapor. On the other hand, a pump continuously removes a fixed volume V (in m³ per second; note that 1 liter = 10⁻³ m³) of gas at room temperature T_R. We assume the vapor is an ideal gas and that its pressure everywhere (including at the pump) is p_p.\n\nBelow we work through each part step‐by‐step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPart (a): Finding p_p\n\n1. The evaporation rate (in moles per second) is given by\n\n  ṅ_evap = Q / L    (since each mole requires latent heat L).\n\n2. At the pump the same number of moles must be removed so that the flow rate is\n\n  ṅ_pump = (p_p V) / (RT_R)    (from the ideal gas law, pV = nRT, solved for n).\n\n3.

When expressed using the latent heat per mole, L, and neglecting the liquid’s volume compared to that of the vapor we get\n\n  dp/dT = (L p)/(R T²).\n\nThis differential equation can be rearranged and integrated as follows.\n\n1. Write:\n  dp/p = (L/R) (dT/T²).\n\n2. Integrate both sides from the known boiling point at atmospheric pressure (T₀, p₀) to the new pressure and temperature (Tₕₑ, p_p):\n\n  ∫ₚ₀^(pₚ) (1/p) dp = (L/R) ∫ₜ₀^(Tₕₑ) (1/T²)dT.\n\n3.

Solving for 1/Tₕₑ:\n\n  1/Tₕₑ = 1/T₀ – (R/L) ln(p_p/p₀).\n\nThen, inverting we obtain\n\n  Tₕₑ = [1/T₀ – (R/L) ln(p_p/p₀)]⁻¹.\n\nThis is our answer for (b).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nPart (c): Numerical Estimate\n\nWe are given:\n  p₀ = 10⁵ Pa,\n  Q = 0.1 W,\n  L = 100 J/mol,\n  V = 20 liter/sec = 20 × 10⁻³ m³/sec = 0.02 m³/sec,\n  and we take T_R ≈ 300 K (room temperature) and T₀ = 4.2 K.\n\nStep 1. Find p_p from part (a):\n\n  p_p = (R T_R Q)/(L V)\n     = (8.314 J/(mol·K) × 300 K × 0.1 J/s) / (100 J/mol × 0.02 m³/s).\n\nFirst, compute the numerator:\n  8.314 × 300 × 0.1 = 249.42 J/s (the J and second cancel appropriately).\n\nThen, the denominator:\n  100 × 0.02 = 2 J/s.\n\nThus:\n  p_p = 249.42 / 2 ≈ 124.71 Pa.\n\nWe therefore have p_p ≈ 125 Pa.\n\nStep 2. Now use the Clausius–Clapeyron relation from (b):\n\n  1/Tₕₑ = 1/T₀ – (R/L) ln(p_p/p₀).\n\nFirst, compute 1/T₀:\n  1/4.2 ≈ 0.2381 K⁻¹.\n\nNext, compute ln(p_p/p₀):\n  p_p/p₀ = 125 / 10⁵ = 0.00125.\n  ln(0.00125) ≈ –6.6847.\n\nNow, note that (R/L) = 8.314/100 = 0.08314 K⁻¹.\n\nThus:\n\n  1/Tₕₑ = 0.2381 – (0.08314 × (–6.6847))\n     = 0.2381 + 0.08314×6.6847.\n\nCalculating 0.08314×6.6847 gives approximately 0.556.\n\nSo:\n\n  1/Tₕₑ ≈ 0.2381 + 0.556 ≈ 0.7941 K⁻¹.\n\nFinally, invert to find Tₕₑ:\n\n  Tₕₑ ≈ 1/0.7941 ≈ 1.259 K,\n  or roughly Tₕₑ ≈ 1.26 K.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answers\n\n(a) The lowest pressure the pump can maintain over the He surface is\n\n  \\[\n  \\boxed{p_p = \\frac{R T_R Q}{L V}}\n  \\]\n\n(b) The corresponding equilibrium liquid temperature is\n\n  \\[\n  \\boxed{T_{He} = \\left[\\frac{1}{T_0} - \\frac{R}{L}\\ln\\left(\\frac{p_p}{p_0}\\right)\\right]^{-1}}\n  \\]\n\n(c) For the given values, one finds\n\n  \\[\n  \\boxed{T_{He} \\approx 1.26\\,\\text{K}}\n  \\]", "final_answers": ["p_p = \\frac{R T_R Q}{L V}", "T_{He} = \\left[\\frac{1}{T_0} - \\frac{R}{L}\\ln\\left(\\frac{p_p}{p_0}\\right)\\right]^{-1}", "T_{He} \\approx 1.26\\,\\text{K}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "p_p = \\frac{R T_R Q}{L V}", "expr2": "p_p = \\frac{Q R T_R}{L V}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "Q*R*T/(L*V)", "expr2": "Q*R*T/(L*V)"}, "sympy_result": true, "llm_result": null, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "T_{He} = \\left[\\frac{1}{T_0} - \\frac{R}{L}\\ln\\left(\\frac{p_p}{p_0}\\right)\\right]^{-1}", "expr2": "p_p = \\frac{Q R T_R}{L V}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "T", "expr2": "Q*R*T/(L*V)"}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "T_{He} = \\left[\\frac{1}{T_0} - \\frac{R}{L}\\ln\\left(\\frac{p_p}{p_0}\\right)\\right]^{-1}", "expr2": "T_{\\text{He}} = \\left( 1 + \\frac{R T_0}{L} \\ln \\frac{p_0}{p_p} \\right)^{-1} T_0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": true, "final_result": true, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "T_{He} \\approx 1.26\\,\\text{K}", "expr2": "p_p = \\frac{Q R T_R}{L V}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "T_{He} \\approx 1.26\\,\\text{K}", "expr2": "T_{\\text{He}} = \\left( 1 + \\frac{R T_0}{L} \\ln \\frac{p_0}{p_p} \\right)^{-1} T_0"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "T_{He} \\approx 1.26\\,\\text{K}", "expr2": "p_p = 122 \\, \\text{Pa}, \\, T_{\\text{He}} = 1.26 \\, \\text{K}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.6666666666666666}

Then\n\n  I = ∫₍u=r_A₎⁽r_B⁾ [L/(r_B – r_A)] du / [π u²]  =  (L/(r_B – r_A)π) ∫₍r_A₎⁽r_B⁾ du/u².\n\nThe integral ∫ du/u² is elementary:\n\n  ∫ du/u² = –1/u.\n\nThus, we have\n\n  I = (L/(r_B – r_A)π) [ (–1/u) |₍r_A₎⁽r_B⁾ ]\n      = (L/(r_B – r_A)π) [ ( –1/r_B + 1/r_A ) ]\n      = (L/(r_B – r_A)π) (1/r_A – 1/r_B).\n\nStep 2. Write Q̇ in Terms of Given Quantities\n\nNow the expression for Q̇ becomes\n\n  Q̇ = K (T_B – T_A) / I \n     = K (T_B – T_A) / { [L/(r_B – r_A)π] (1/r_A – 1/r_B) }\n     = [K π (r_B – r_A)(T_B – T_A)] / [L(1/r_A – 1/r_B)].\n\nNotice that the difference in the parentheses can be simplified. Compute\n\n  1/r_A – 1/r_B = (r_B – r_A)/(r_A r_B).\n\nThus, substituting this result we get\n\n  Q̇ = [K π (r_B – r_A)(T_B – T_A)] / [L((r_B – r_A)/(r_A r_B))]\n     = (K π r_A r_B (T_B – T_A))/L.\n\nThis is the answer to part (a).\n\nStep 3. Find the Temperature at x = L/2 for Part (b)\n\nFor part (b) we are given:\n  r_B = 2r_A,  T_A = 0°C,  T_B = 90°C.\n\nWe now wish to find T(x) at x = L/2. From the differential equation we had\n\n  dT/dx = – Q̇/[K A(x)].\n\nIntegrate from 0 to x (where T(0) = T_A) to write\n\n  T(x) – T_A = – ∫₀ˣ Q̇/(K A(x')) dx'.\n\nSince we already know Q̇ and T_A = 0, at x = L/2 we have\n\n  T(L/2) = Q̇/(K) ∫₀^(L/2) dx'/[π (r_A + (r_B – r_A)x'/L)²].\n\nAs before, perform the substitution for this partial integration. Let\n\n  u = r_A + (r_B – r_A)x'/L,  then  dx' = (L/(r_B – r_A)) du.\n\nFor x' = 0, u = r_A; for x' = L/2, u becomes\n\n  u = r_A + (r_B – r_A)(1/2).\n\nThus, the integral becomes\n\n  I₁ = ∫₀^(L/2) dx'/(π [r_A+(r_B – r_A)x'/L]²)\n    = L/(π (r_B – r_A)) ∫₍r_A₎^(r_A+(r_B-r_A)/2) du/u²\n    = L/(π (r_B – r_A)) [ (1/r_A) – 1/(r_A+(r_B–r_A)/2) ].\n\nNow insert r_B = 2r_A. Then:\n\n  r_B – r_A = r_A,\n  r_A + (r_B – r_A)/2 = r_A + r_A/2 = 3r_A/2.\n\nThus\n\n  I₁ = L/(π r_A) [ (1/r_A) – 1/(3r_A/2) ]\n     = L/(π r_A) [ (1/r_A) – (2/(3r_A)) ]\n     = L/(π r_A) [ (1 – 2/3)/r_A ]\n     = L/(π r_A) [ (1/3)/r_A ]\n     = L/(3π r_A²).\n\nNow, what is Q̇? We determined earlier that\n\n  Q̇ = (K π r_A r_B (T_B – T_A))/L.\n   Since r_B = 2r_A, T_B – T_A = 90,\n   we have Q̇ = (K π r_A (2r_A)(90))/L = (180 πK r_A²)/L.\n\nReturning to T(L/2):\n\n  T(L/2) = Q̇/(K) * I₁\n     = (180 πK r_A²/L)/K * (L/(3π r_A²))\n     = 180/3 \n     = 60°C.\n\nThus, part (b) gives T(L/2) = 60°C.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n(a) The rate of heat flow is\n\n  Q̇ = (πK r_A r_B (T_B – T_A))/L.\n\n(b) When r_B = 2r_A, T_A = 0°C, and T_B = 90°C, the temperature halfway along the wire is 60°C.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\dot{Q} = \\frac{\\pi K r_A r_B (T_B-T_A)}{L},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &T(L/2) = 60^\\circ\\,\\text{C}.\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\dot{Q} = \\frac{\\pi K r_A r_B (T_B-T_A)}{L},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &T(L/2) = 60^\\circ\\,\\text{C}.\n\\end{aligned}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\dot{Q} = \\frac{\\pi K r_A r_B (T_B-T_A)}{L},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &T(L/2) = 60^\\circ\\,\\text{C}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "\\dot{Q} = \\frac{\\pi r_A r_B K (T_A - T_B)}{L}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}, {"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{(a)}\\quad &\\dot{Q} = \\frac{\\pi K r_A r_B (T_B-T_A)}{L},\\\\[1mm]\n\\text{(b)}\\quad &T(L/2) = 60^\\circ\\,\\text{C}.\n\\end{aligned}", "expr2": "T_C = \\frac{T_A + 2T_B}{3}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "Statistical Mechanics/20-1", "solution": "We are asked to compare two methods for extracting energy from 1 gram of water:\n\n1. Using the thermal energy available from a 10°C temperature difference in the water.\n2. Extracting gravitational potential energy from water falling 110 m.\n\nLet’s go through each method step by step.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 1. Gravitational Potential Energy\n\nThe gravitational potential energy (GPE) available from a mass m falling a height h is given by\n\n  GPE = m g h\n\nFor 1 gram of water:\n  m = 0.001 kg   (since 1 g = 0.001 kg)\n  g ≈ 9.8 m/s²\n  h = 110 m\n\nThus,\n\n  GPE = 0.001 kg × 9.8 m/s² × 110 m ≈ 1.078 J\n\nSo, about 1.08 joule of energy per gram is available in gravitational form.\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 2. Thermal Energy Extraction\n\nThe water at the top is assumed to be at room temperature (≈ 298 K) and at the bottom, 10°C lower (≈ 288 K). The amount of heat energy contained in 1 gram due to a change in temperature is given by\n\n  Q = c_V ΔT\n\nwhere c_V is the specific heat, here 4.15 J/(g·K) and ΔT = 10 K. Hence,\n\n  Q = 4.15 J/(g·K) × 10 K = 41.5 J per gram\n\nHowever, when converting thermal energy into work, one must account for the thermodynamic efficiency limits. The maximum efficiency that any heat engine can achieve is given by the Carnot efficiency:\n\n  η_Carnot = (T_hot − T_cold) / T_hot\n\nUsing:\n  T_hot = 298 K   (room temperature)\n  T_cold = 288 K\n\nWe get\n\n  η_Carnot = (298 − 288) / 298 ≈ 10/298 ≈ 0.0336  (or about 3.36%)\n\nThus, the maximum work extractable thermally is:\n\n  W_max = η_Carnot × Q = 0.0336 × 41.5 J ≈ 1.39 J\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 3. Comparison\n\n- Gravitational energy gives: ≈ 1.08 J per gram.\n- Maximum thermal energy extractable (ideal Carnot engine) gives: ≈ 1.39 J per gram.\n\nSo, in these idealized calculations, the maximum work one can extract from the 10°C thermal difference in 1 gram of water (≈ 1.39 J) is of comparable magnitude to that available from letting the water fall 110 m (≈ 1.08 J).\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nFinal Answer\n\nThus, the two methods yield roughly the same amount of energy per gram: about 1 to 1.4 joule per gram.

{"id": "Statistical Mechanics/19-4", "solution": "We wish to estimate the electric current I (in coulombs per second) leaving a small hole (area A) in a cavity that contains electrons. In the cavity the electrons are in thermal equilibrium at temperature τ (in energy units; i.e. τ = k_B T), with chemical potential μ, and they are non‐interacting. Outside the cavity the potential energy is raised by an amount V > 0 so that an electron can leave only if its kinetic energy is larger than V. Finally, we assume that (V – μ) ≫ τ so that only electrons in the high–energy tail of the distribution have enough energy to escape.\n\nThe idea is to compute the number (per unit time) of electrons leaving the cavity through the hole, and then multiply by the electron charge e. Because only electrons having kinetic energy \n  E = ½ m v² > V\ncan escape, we must integrate over those electrons with speeds larger than v₀ = √(2V/m) and, furthermore, only those electrons heading toward the hole actually exit (say the hole is perpendicular to the x–axis, so only electrons with vₓ > 0 contribute).\n\nStep 1. Writing the distribution\n\nSince (V – μ) ≫ τ, the electrons in the tail (E > V) obey\n  f(E) ∝ exp[–(E – μ)/τ].\nMore precisely, the (normalized) Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution is given by\n\n  f(v) = (m/(2πτ))^(3/2) exp(–(½ m v² – μ)/τ).\n\nStep 2. Writing the flux through the hole\n\nNow, the number of electrons with velocity between v and v+dv is f(v) d³v. When considering electrons leaving the cavity (with vₓ > 0) the number crossing a unit area per unit time is\n\n  dΦ = f(v) vₓ d³v\nwith the constraint that the total speed is such that ½ m v² > V.\n\nThus the current I (charge per unit time) leaving through the hole of area A is\n\n  I = eA ∫ d³v f(v) vₓ θ(vₓ) θ(½ m v² – V),\nwhere θ is the Heaviside step function.\n\nStep 3. Changing to spherical coordinates\n\nUsing spherical coordinates in velocity space with\n\n  vₓ = v cosθ,\n  d³v = v² sinθ dv dθ dφ,\nand noting that the condition vₓ > 0 means 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2, and the energy cutoff means v ≥ v₀ = √(2V/m), we can write\n\n  I = eA ∫₀^(2π)dφ ∫₀^(π/2) dθ sinθ (cosθ) ∫_(v₀)^∞ dv v³ f(v).\n\nThe φ–integration gives a factor 2π, and the θ–integration is\n\n  ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ dθ = ½.\n\nThus, we have\n\n  I = eA π ∫_(v₀)^∞ v³ f(v) dv.\n\nStep 4. Inserting the Maxwell–Boltzmann form\n\nSubstitute\n  f(v) = (m/(2πτ))^(3/2) exp[μ/τ] exp(–m v²/(2τ)).\nThen\n  I = eA π (m/(2πτ))^(3/2) exp(μ/τ) ∫_(v₀)^∞ v³ exp(–m v²/(2τ)) dv.\n\nStep 5. Changing integration variable\n\nLet\n  u = m v²/(2τ)   so that  du = (m/τ)v dv  ⇒  v dv = (τ/m)du.\nSince v³ dv = v² (v dv) and v² = (2τ/m) u, we have\n  v³ dv = (2τ/m u)(τ/m du) = (2τ²/m²) u du.\nAlso, when v = v₀, note that\n  u₀ = m v₀²/(2τ) = m(2V/m)/(2τ) = V/τ.\nThus, the integral becomes\n  ∫_(v₀)^∞ v³ exp(–m v²/(2τ)) dv = (2τ²/m²) ∫_(u₀)^∞ u e^(–u) du.\nBut\n  ∫_(u₀)^∞ u e^(–u) du = (u₀ + 1)e^(–u₀).\nThus, the expression for I becomes\n\n  I = eA π (m/(2πτ))^(3/2) exp(μ/τ) (2τ²/m²) (u₀ + 1) e^(–u₀),\n\nwith u₀ = V/τ.\n\nStep 6. Simplifying the prefactor\n\nLet’s simplify the prefactor:\n\n  π (m/(2πτ))^(3/2) (2τ²/m²)\n= π * (m^(3/2))/( (2πτ)^(3/2)) * (2τ²/m²)\n= 2π τ² m^(3/2) / [m² (2πτ)^(3/2)]\n= (2π τ²)/(m^(1/2) (2πτ)^(3/2)).\n\nNow, (2πτ)^(3/2) = (2π)^(3/2) τ^(3/2) so that\n\n  (2π τ²)/( (2π)^(3/2)τ^(3/2) m^(1/2)) = [2π/( (2π)^(3/2)] * (τ^(2-3/2))/(m^(1/2))\n            = [2π/(2π√(2π))] (τ^(1/2))/(m^(1/2))\n            = (1/√(2π))√(τ/m).\n\nThus, our current becomes\n\n  I = eA √(τ/(2π m)) exp(μ/τ) (1 + V/τ) e^(–V/τ).\n\nWe can write this result as\n\n  I = eA √(τ/(2π m)) (1 + V/τ) exp[(μ – V)/τ].\n\nStep 7. Final answer and discussion\n\nThis formula tells us that the current is determined by the “thermal velocity” √(τ/m) (with an additional factor 1/√(2π)), is proportional to the area A, and is exponentially suppressed for V > μ by a factor exp[(μ – V)/τ]. In the limit where V ≫ τ (and recalling that V – μ ≫ τ), the factor 1 + V/τ is dominated by V/τ.\n\nTherefore, the final estimate for the escaping current is\n\n  I ≈ eA √(τ/(2π m)) (1 + V/τ) exp[(μ – V)/τ].\n\nNow we box the final answer in Latex as requested.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{I \\approx eA\\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{2\\pi m}}\\,\\left(1+\\frac{V}{\\tau}\\right)\\exp\\Bigl(\\frac{\\mu-V}{\\tau}\\Bigr)}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["I \\approx eA\\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{2\\pi m}}\\,\\left(1+\\frac{V}{\\tau}\\right)\\exp\\Bigl(\\frac{\\mu-V}{\\tau}\\Bigr)"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "I \\approx eA\\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{2\\pi m}}\\,\\left(1+\\frac{V}{\\tau}\\right)\\exp\\Bigl(\\frac{\\mu-V}{\\tau}\\Bigr)", "expr2": "I = -\\frac{4 \\pi e A m \\tau^2}{h^3} \\left(1 + \\frac{V}{\\tau}\\right) e^{-(V - \\mu)/\\tau}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "sqrt(2)*A*I*approx*e*sqrt(tau/(m*pi))*(V + tau)*exp(Bigl(Bigr*(-V + mu)/tau))/(2*tau)", "expr2": "4*A*e**((-V + mu + tau)/tau)*m*pi*tau*(-V - tau)/h**3"}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": null}], "accuracy": 0.0}

(In what follows we use T in place of τ and write TE for the characteristic temperature.)

Write the general expressions\n\nFor noninteracting particles the number of particles in the excited states is given by\n  Nₑₓ = ∫ d³p/(h³) ⋅ 1/[exp(β ε(p)) – 1],\nwith β = 1/(kT) and ε(p) = p²/(2m).

{"id": "Statistical Mechanics/17-4", "solution": "We are given a system in which each special molecule has two sites that may adsorb an ideal gas particle. One site binds a particle with energy –ε₀ and the other with energy –ε₀/2. The gas is in equilibrium with the adsorption sites; its pressure is held fixed by a movable piston and the temperature T is fixed by a heat bath. In equilibrium the adsorption sites “exchange” particles with the gas reservoir. (It is common to treat this situation in the grand‐canonical ensemble.)\n\nStep 1. Write down the Grand‐Canonical Partition Function for Each Site\n\nFor each site in contact with a reservoir having chemical potential μ (or fugacity z = e^(βμ) with β = 1/(k_BT)), the two possible states (empty or occupied) have Boltzmann factors as follows:\n\n• If the site is empty, the Boltzmann weight is 1.\n• If the site is occupied, the particle contributes both the binding energy and the chemical potential (remember the energy of an occupied site is –E, where E is the binding energy given in the problem). Thus its weight is z e^(βE).\n\nThus, for the site with binding energy E₁ = ε₀ (remember the energy is –ε₀ for occupancy) the partition function is\n\n  Q₁ = 1 + z e^(βε₀).\n\nAnd for the site with binding energy E₂ = ε₀/2 the partition function is\n\n  Q₂ = 1 + z e^(β(ε₀/2)).\n\nStep 2. Partition Function for a Single Molecule\n\nBecause the two sites are independent (there are no interactions between the adsorptions at the two sites), the partition function for one molecule is the product\n\n  Q = Q₁ Q₂ = (1 + z e^(βε₀)) (1 + z e^(β(ε₀/2))).\n\nStep 3. Find the Probability of Exactly One Site Being Occupied\n\nThere are two mutually exclusive cases for a molecule to have exactly one adsorbed particle:\n\n• Case A: Site 1 (with binding energy –ε₀) is occupied and site 2 is empty.\n• Case B: Site 2 (with binding energy –ε₀/2) is occupied and site 1 is empty.\n\nLet’s compute the weight for each case:\n\n• Case A: The weight is\n  W_A = [z e^(βε₀)] × [1] \n     = z e^(βε₀).\n\n• Case B: The weight is\n  W_B = [1] × [z e^(β(ε₀/2))]\n     = z e^(β(ε₀/2)).\n\nSo the total weight for “exactly one site full” is\n\n  W_one = z e^(βε₀) + z e^(β(ε₀/2)).\n\nSince the total partition function for a molecule is Q, the probability that a given molecule has exactly one particle adsorbed is:\n\n  f₁ = (z e^(βε₀) + z e^(β(ε₀/2))) / [(1 + z e^(βε₀))(1 + z e^(β(ε₀/2)))].\n\nStep 4. Express the Fugacity z in Terms of Gas Pressure\n\nIn a gas of non‐interacting particles, one often finds the relation\n  p = z (k_BT)/Λ³,\nwhere Λ is the thermal de Broglie wavelength. (Note that sometimes a reference pressure is introduced so that z is dimensionless; here we assume that z is defined in such a way that the relation above holds.) Thus,\n  z = (p Λ³)/(k_BT).\n\nStep 5. Final Answer\n\nReplacing z in our expression for f₁, we have\n\n  f₁(p,T) = [ (pΛ³/(k_BT)) ( e^(βε₀) + e^(β(ε₀/2)) ) ]\n      / { [1 + (pΛ³/(k_BT)) e^(βε₀)] [1 + (pΛ³/(k_BT)) e^(β(ε₀/2))] }.\n\nThis gives the fraction of the special molecules that have exactly one adsorption site occupied as a function of the gas pressure p and temperature T.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{ f_{1}(p,T)=\\frac{\\frac{p\\Lambda^3}{k_BT}\\Big(e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0}+e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0/2}\\Big)}{\\Big(1+\\frac{p\\Lambda^3}{k_BT}e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0}\\Big)\\Big(1+\\frac{p\\Lambda^3}{k_BT}e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0/2}\\Big)} }\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\beta=\\frac{1}{k_BT}\\).", "final_answers": ["f_{1}(p,T)=\\frac{\\frac{p\\Lambda^3}{k_BT}\\Big(e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0}+e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0/2}\\Big)}{\\Big(1+\\frac{p\\Lambda^3}{k_BT}e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0}\\Big)\\Big(1+\\frac{p\\Lambda^3}{k_BT}e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0/2}\\Big)}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "f_{1}(p,T)=\\frac{\\frac{p\\Lambda^3}{k_BT}\\Big(e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0}+e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0/2}\\Big)}{\\Big(1+\\frac{p\\Lambda^3}{k_BT}e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0}\\Big)\\Big(1+\\frac{p\\Lambda^3}{k_BT}e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0/2}\\Big)}", "expr2": "P_{2}^{1} = \\frac{2p_0 p \\left(1 + e^{-\\epsilon_0 / (2 \\tau)}\\right)}{\\left[p_0 + p \\left(1 + e^{-\\epsilon_0 / \\tau}\\right)\\right]^2}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "Lambda**3*p*Big(Big*e**(beta*epsilon/2) + e**(beta*epsilon))/(T*k*Big(Big*Lambda**3*e**(beta*epsilon/2)*p/(T*k) + 1)*Big(Big*Lambda**3*e**(beta*epsilon)*p/(T*k) + 1))", "expr2": "2*p*p(1 + e**(-epsilon/(2*tau)))/(p**2 + 2*p*p(1 + e**(-epsilon/tau)) + p(1 + e**(-epsilon/tau))**2)"}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": "SymPy computation timed out!"}], "accuracy": 0.0}
{"id": "Statistical Mechanics/17-3", "solution": "We wish to calculate the fraction of adsorption sites (coverage) that are occupied by hydrogen. Each adsorption site may either be empty or occupied by one hydrogen molecule that can bind in one of two states: one giving an energy –ε₀ and the other –ε₀/2. The system is in contact with a heat bath (temperature T) and with a hydrogen gas reservoir at pressure P (for which we assume ideal gas behavior). In the following we outline the derivation step‐by‐step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Write the Grand Canonical Partition Function for One Site\n\nFor an adsorption site the “microscopic” states are as follows:\n\n• State 0 (site empty): energy = 0 (by choice) ⇒ weight = 1.\n• State 1 (occupied in state “1”): energy = –ε₀ ⇒ weight = exp[β(μ – (–ε₀))] = exp[β(μ + ε₀)].\n• State 2 (occupied in state “2”): energy = –ε₀/2 ⇒ weight = exp[β(μ + ε₀/2)].\n\nHere β = 1/(k_BT) and μ is the chemical potential of hydrogen (in the gas phase). Thus, the grand canonical partition function for a single adsorption site is\n\n  z_site = 1 + exp[β(μ + ε₀)] + exp[β(μ + ε₀/2)].\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Write the Coverage (Fraction of Adsorbed Sites)\n\nThe coverage θ is the probability that a given site is occupied. Since the empty site (state 0) has weight 1, the probability that the site is occupied is simply the combined weight of states 1 and 2 divided by z_site. Therefore,\n\n  θ = (exp[β(μ + ε₀)] + exp[β(μ + ε₀/2)]) / (1 + exp[β(μ + ε₀)] + exp[β(μ + ε₀/2)]).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Relate the Chemical Potential to the Pressure\n\nFor an ideal gas, the chemical potential is given by\n  μ = k_BT ln(Λ³P),\nwhere Λ is the thermal de Broglie wavelength of the hydrogen molecule. (Any constant absorbed into Λ is acceptable so long as one is consistent.) Thus, we can write\n\n  exp(βμ) = exp(ln(Λ³P)) = Λ³P.\n\nPlug this into the expression for θ. That is, express each term as\n\n  exp[β(μ + ε₀)] = (Λ³P) e^(β ε₀),\n  exp[β(μ + ε₀/2)] = (Λ³P) e^(β ε₀/2).\n\nThus, the coverage becomes\n\n  θ = (Λ³P [e^(β ε₀) + e^(β ε₀/2)]) / (1 + Λ³P [e^(β ε₀) + e^(β ε₀/2)]).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThe coverage (fraction of adsorbed sites) as a function of temperature T and pressure P is\n\n  θ(P,T) = (Λ³P [e^(β ε₀) + e^(β ε₀/2)]) / (1 + Λ³P [e^(β ε₀) + e^(β ε₀/2)]),\nwith β = 1/(k_BT).\n\nWe box the final answer in LaTeX as requested:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\theta(P,T)=\\frac{\\Lambda^3P\\Bigl(e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0}+e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0/2}\\Bigr)}{1+\\Lambda^3P\\Bigl(e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0}+e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0/2}\\Bigr)}\\quad,\\quad\\beta=\\frac{1}{k_BT}\n}\n\\]", "final_answers": ["\\theta(P,T)=\\frac{\\Lambda^3P\\Bigl(e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0}+e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0/2}\\Bigr)}{1+\\Lambda^3P\\Bigl(e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0}+e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0/2}\\Bigr)}\\quad,\\quad\\beta=\\frac{1}{k_BT}"], "equivalency_results": [{"input_expressions": {"expr1": "\\theta(P,T)=\\frac{\\Lambda^3P\\Bigl(e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0}+e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0/2}\\Bigr)}{1+\\Lambda^3P\\Bigl(e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0}+e^{\\beta\\epsilon_0/2}\\Bigr)}\\quad,\\quad\\beta=\\frac{1}{k_BT}", "expr2": "f = \\frac{p\\left(1+e^{-\\epsilon_0 / 2 \\tau}\\right)}{p_0+p\\left(1+e^{-\\epsilon_0 / 2 \\tau}\\right)}"}, "preprocessed_expressions": {"expr1": "1/(T*k)", "expr2": "p(1 + e**(-epsilon/(2*tau)))/(p + p(1 + e**(-epsilon/(2*tau))))"}, "sympy_result": null, "llm_result": false, "final_result": false, "error": "Invalid NaN comparison"}], "accuracy": 0.0}
