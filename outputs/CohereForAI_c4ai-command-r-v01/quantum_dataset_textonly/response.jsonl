This will allow us to conclude that the component of the angular momentum along the $z$ direction, $L_z$, is quantized, indicating a definite angular momentum. \n\nThe strategy will be to rewrite the given wavefunction in terms of spherical coordinates and observe its dependence on the azimuthal angle $\\phi$. The general form of the wavefunction in spherical coordinates is:\n$$\n\\psi(r,\\theta,\\phi)=R(r)\\Theta(\\theta)\\Phi(\\phi).\n$$\n\n1. First, we need to express $x, y,$ and $z$ in terms of the new coordinates: \n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx &= r\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi), \\\\\ny &= r\\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi), \\\\\nz &= r\\cos(\\theta).\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n2.

Next, we'll determine the values of $L^2$ and $L_z$ operators acting on our wavefunction. The square of the angular momentum operator $L^2$ has eigenvalue $\\hbar^2 l(l+1)$, where $l$ is the angular momentum quantum number. The $L_z$ operator has eigenvalues of $\\hbar m_l$, with $m_l$ being the magnetic quantum number. \n\nSince our wavefunction depends on $\\phi$ as $\\cos(\\phi)$, we can immediately say that the magnetic quantum number $m_l=0$, which means that the associated value of $L_z$ is zero. The angular momentum quantum number $l$ can be determined by examining the behavior of $\\psi$ near the poles, i.e., as $\\theta\\to 0$ or $\\theta\\to\\pi$. But the function doesn't behave differently at these points compared to other angles, which suggests that our function is even in $\\phi$, so we assign $l=0$.\n\nTherefore, the values of $L^2$ and $L_z$ for this state are:\n$$\nL^2\\psi = \\hbar^2\\cdot 0\\cdot\\psi, \\quad L_z\\psi = 0\\cdot\\hbar\\psi.\n$$\n\nIn conclusion, the system described by the wavefunction $\\psi(x,y,z)$ indeed possesses a definite angular momentum, with $L^2=\\boxed{0\\,\\hbar^2}$ and $L_z=\\boxed{0\\,\\hbar}$."}

Is it paramagnetic or diamagnetic?", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "The magnetic susceptibility ($\\chi$) is a measure of how easily a material can be magnetized when exposed to an external magnetic field, and it's often used to characterize the response of materials to such fields. For a single helium atom in its ground state, we need to consider the electronic configuration and the associated angular momentum.\n\nHelium is a noble gas with the electron configuration $1s^2$, which corresponds to a closed shell configuration. According to Hund's rule, both electrons will occupy different spatial orbitals (spin up and spin down) resulting in zero net angular momentum for the electron cloud. This is a very stable arrangement, characteristic of a non-magnetic substance. \n\nNow, let's analyze the behavior under an external magnetic field:\n1. **Paramagnetism**: Paramagnetic substances have unpaired electrons, meaning their atomic electrons can align with an external magnetic field, leading to a positive susceptibility. As Helium has no unpaired electrons, it's not paramagnetic.\n\n2. **Diamagnetism**: Even though Helium isn't paramagnetic, it might still exhibit a weak response to an external magnetic field, typical of diamagnetic materials. The presence of any electrons itself gives rise to a small negative susceptibility. However, this effect is usually quite weak.\n\nSo, the magnetic susceptibility of elemental helium in its ground state is expected to be extremely close to zero, making it effectively a non-magnetic element. It's worth noting that helium does have nuclear magnetic moments, but they're not considered here as the prompt asks about the atom's susceptibility.\n\nTherefore:\n$$\\boxed{ \\chi \\approx 0} $$\nIt's diamagnetic, but the effect is so minuscule as to be practically insignificant."}

We also know that the asymptotic behavior must match the original ground state solution away from the delta function. Therefore, the first modified nodal point after the delta function will appear earlier than in the pure square well case, causing the oscillation period to increase.\n\nAs for the energy, adding the delta function potential certainly raises the energy levels due to the additional repulsion. The limit as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$ implies an infinitely tall barrier, which makes the well semi-classicaly inaccessible, hence the particle is effectively confined to either side of the barrier, essentially doubling the effective length of the confinement, increasing the ground state energy. \n\nTherefore, we conclude that the energy increases without bound as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$. \n\nThe wave function becomes zero at the former location of the node closest to $x=L/2$, develops a discontinuity there, and spreads out with increased amplitude decay on either side, reflecting the growing energy.\n\nThe answer is therefore:\n$$\\boxed{E_\\infty = \\frac{\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{2mL^2}}.$$"}

As the initial state has definite angular momentum, the scattered state must also have the same angular momentum. Since the problem is spherical, the scattered wavefunction must depend on $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ only through the combination $\\Theta(\\theta,\\phi)$, the angular part of the spherical harmonics corresponding to the correct angular momentum. However, the form given in the question has no such dependence. The azimuthal angle dependence must therefore disappear upon acting with the scattering matrix, i.e., $f(\\theta,\\phi)=f(\\theta)$.\n\nb) The argument in part a) relies on the specific form of the wavefunction's angular dependence in the problem at hand. Considering rotations about an arbitrary axis doesn't change this conclusion, as the key property used was the angular momentum conservation along the axis of rotation. The dependence on $\\phi$ must still drop out, but there's no general reason for the same to happen with $\\theta$. \n\nc) As the incident energy approaches zero, we're dealing with low-energy scattering. In this regime, the scattering angle ($\\theta$) dependence becomes less significant compared to the incident particle's wavelength.

Do not evaluate integrals, but carefully explain the notation in which you express your result.  ", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "Let's solve this problem step by step:\n**a) Energy levels and quantum numbers:**\nThe ground state of any atom is always the lowest energy state, followed by successively higher energy excited states. For Helium, the ground state configuration is $1s^2$. This can be understood by considering that both electrons will occupy the lowest available energy level, as required by the Pauli Exclusion Principle. \n\nThe first excited states arise from promoting one or both electrons to the next available energy level. The possible configurations are:\n\n1. $1s^2 \\, 2s$: Both electrons excited to the $2s$ level.\n2. $1s^2 \\, 2p$: Both electrons promoted to the $2p$ level.\n3. $1s^{1} \\, 2s^{1}$: One electron in $1s$ and one in $2s$.\n4. $1s^{1} \\, 2p^{1}$: Same as above but with one electron in $2p$.\n\nTherefore, we have the following order of energy levels and corresponding quantum numbers:\n1. Ground state: $^{1}S_{0}^{\\text{e}}\\,$, with $\\ell=0, m_\\ell=0, s=\\frac{1}{2}, ms=\\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\text{and}\\, E_{1s}$.\n\n2. Excited states: \n$^{2}S_{1/2}^{\\text{e}}\\,$, with $\\ell=0, m_\\ell=0, s=1, ms=\\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\text{and}\\, E_{2s}$.\n\n$^{2}P_{1/2,3/2}^{\\text{o}}\\,$, with $\\ell=1, m_\\ell=\\pm 1, 0, s=1, ms=\\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\text{and}\\, E_{2p}$.\n\nNote that I've labeled the states with their term symbol, composed of the term symbol for hydrogen ($^nL$) with the addition of the total spin ($S$) and its magnetic number ($M_S$). Even though the individual spins are $\\frac{1}{2}$, the total spin can be $\\frac{1}{2}$ or $1$ depending on whether the electrons' spins are parallel or antiparallel. \n\nParity relates to the behavior under spatial inversion. In our case, all states are even under inversion $(+1)$, since they correspond to symmetric combinations of hydrogenic orbitals, which are themselves even functions.\n \n**b) Role of the Pauli Principle:**\nThe Pauli Principle dictates that no two electrons in an atom can have the same four quantum numbers $(\\ell,m_\\ell,s,ms)$. This means that when exciting electrons from the $1s$ shell, which has only one allowed value for $m_\\ell$ $(0)$ and one for spin $(\\frac{1}{2})$, the only option is to keep both electrons with the same quantum numbers or split them into different levels. \n\nSo, in the first excited state $(2s)$, both electrons occupy the $2s$ level due to the lack of other options. This state is therefore a Spin Singlet, with zero total spin. \n\nFor the second excited state, there are two choices: either both electrons go to the $2p$ level, forming a $^2P$ state (Triplet), or each goes into a different level, creating a $^1S + ^1P$ combination, which has a total spin of 1. \n\nThis illustrates how the Pauli Principle determines the possible quantum configurations of an atomic system and hence the energy levels. It restricts the ways electrons can be distributed, leading to a characteristic pattern of energy levels.\n\n**c) Perturbation Formulas for Energies:**\nWe're asked to consider a simple model where the Coulomb interaction is treated exactly, i.e., the electrons move independently in the potential of the nucleus, neglecting exchange and correlation effects. Exchange phenomena lead to slight energy corrections, especially for the ground state, which would split the $^1S$ and $^3S$ states closer to the $^2S$ state. However, let's stick to the direct Coulomb interaction here.\n\nThe energy of a hydrogen-like orbital is given by:\n$$E_{n\\ell}=-\\frac{Z^2}{2n^2}\\,\\, .$$\n\nThe configuration of the ground state of helium gives rise to the energy:\n$$E_{\\text{gs}}=2\\cdot E_{1s}=-\\frac{Z^2}{2\\cdot 1^2}\\,\\,.$$\n\nFor the first excited states, things are more complicated, as we now have configurations involving multiple orbitals. We use a perturbative approach, writing the wavefunction of the helium atom as a sum of hydrogenic orbitals, and calculating the expectation value of the energy.  \n\nThe $2s$ state:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nE_{2s}&=\\langle 2s|\\hat H|2s\\rangle\\\\\n&=-\\frac{Z^2}{8}\\left(\\frac{1}{2s^2}+\\frac{1}{2s'^2}\\right)+\\text{higher order terms}\\\\\n&\\approx -\\frac{Z^2}{4}\\,\\,,\n\\end{aligned}$$\nwhere $s$ and $s'$ refer to the radial parts of the wavefunctions of the two electrons.\n\nSimilarly, for the $2p$ state:\n$$E_{2p}=\\langle 2p|\\hat H|2p\\rangle\\approx-\\frac{Z^2}{6}\\,\\,.$$\n\nThese formulae represent the energy correction due to electron-electron repulsion, as in the hydrogenic approximation, the kinetic energy and attraction energy are independent of the nuclear charge $Z$ and thus neglected here.\n\nThus, the energy levels of the first two excited states are approximately:\n$$E_{2s}\\approx -\\frac{Z^2}{4}\\quad \\text{and}\\quad E_{2p}\\approx -\\frac{Z^2}{6}\\,\\,.$$\n\nThe full expression for the first excited states including perturbative corrections would look like this:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n^{2}S_{1/2}^{\\text{e}}\\,&:\\,\\,-\\frac{Z^2}{2\\cdot 2^2}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{4}+\\dots\\right)\\,\\,,\\\\\n^{2}P_{1/2,3/2}^{\\text{o}}\\,&:\\,\\,-\\frac{Z^2}{2\\cdot 2^2}\\left(\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{6}+\\dots\\right)\\,\\,.\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe dots indicate higher-order terms resulting from the actual wave function's dependence on both coordinates, which includes products of radial parts of the form $R_{n\\ell}(r_1)R_{n'\\ell'}(r_2)$.\n\nIt's important to note that while this method provides a reasonable first estimate, it breaks down for larger Z or when greater accuracy is required, due to the neglect of electron correlation and screening of the nuclear charge by the electrons.\n\nFinally, combining all steps and results:\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{Ground State: }^{1}S_{0}^{\\text{e}}\\,\\left(\\ell=0,m_\\ell=0,s=\\frac{1}{2},E\\approx -\\frac{Z^2}{2}\\right) \\\\ \n\\\\\n\\text{First Excited States:} \\\\ \n\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\"}

The radius $r$ of the orbit is given by:\n$$r = \\frac{a_0}{n^2}$$\nwhere $a_0$ is the Bohr radius and $n$ is the principal quantum number, which is 1 for the ground state.

The singlet state ($S=0$) has magnetic sublevels with energies that increase in steps corresponding to the angular momentum projections $\\pm1$, $0$. On the other hand, the triplet state ($S=1$) splits into three levels with energies corresponding to angular momentum projections $+1$, $0$, and $-1$. \n\nThe energy levels in the presence of a magnetic field $B$ can be expressed as:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Singlet}: E_{S=0} = g_S \\mu_B B \\\\\n&\\text{Triplet}: E_{S=1} = -\\frac{g_T}{3} \\mu_B B,\n\\end{aligned}$$\nwhere $g_S$ and $g_T$ are the Landé g-factors for the singlet and triplet states, respectively, and $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton.

Let's compute it step by step:\n\nThe total spin operator $\\mathbf{F}=\\mathbf{s}_{\\mu}+\\mathbf{s}_{e}$ has integer spin quantum numbers; hence, $(F,M_{F})=(1,1)$ could be a possible eigenstate.\nWe know the form of the Pauli matrices, especially $\\sigma_{z}$, which acts on the spin states as:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{s}_z |1,1\\rangle &= \\hbar \\, |1,1\\rangle \\\\\n\\mathbf{s}_z |1,0\\rangle &= 0 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nNow, let's analyze the Hamiltonian's terms:\n\n- The first term, $as_{\\mu}\\cdot \\mathbf{s}_e$, doesn't act on the $(1,1)$ state because the electron's spin part of the wave function is symmetric, and $\\mathbf{s}_{\\mu}$ changes the symmetry.\n\n- The second and third terms, both being Zeeman interactions, contribute equally when acting on the $(1,1)$ state.

Therefore the probability of being in the first excited vibrational state is:\n$$P(1, J) \\approx \\frac{e^{-\\frac{B}{2k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}}{0.1279-\\frac{0.0459}{\\sqrt{T}}} \\approx 0.0114.\\label{probv}\\tag{1}$$\n\n(c) For the rotational states, we need the energies for these states. These are given by:\n$$E_J = AJ(J+1).$$\nUsing a similar Boltzmann factor as before and summing over all possible $J$ values, the populations would be:\n$$P(v, J) = \\frac{e^{-E_J/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}}{Z'},\\quad Z' = \\sum_{J=0}^{\\infty} e^{-E_J/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}.$$\n\nSince the energy gap between rotational states is proportional to $J,$ the population will quickly drop off with increasing $J.$ We can approximate the sum over $J$ using a cutoff, which should be valid because the higher-$J$ states are much less probable. Let's choose a cutoff of $J_\\text{max}=10.$ Additionally, for small $J,$ we can expand the exponential and keep only the leading order term in $J:$\n\\begin{align*}\nZ' &\\approx \\sum_{J=0}^{10} \\left(1-\\frac{AJ(J+1)}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}+\\dots\\right)\\\\\n&\\approx \\sum_{J=0}^{10}1-\\frac{AJ^{2}}{2k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\\\\n&\\approx \\frac{11}{2}\\left(\\frac{2k_{\\mathrm{B}}TA}{J_\\text{max}^2}\\right)=\\frac{11\\cdot 2\\cdot 2.65\\,\\text{meV}\\cdot 2.21\\times 10^{18}\\,\\text{meV}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-2}}{400}.\n\\end{align*}\nSo the ratio of the ground ($J=0$) to first excited ($J=1$) rotational states is then:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{P(0, 0)}{P(0, 1)} &= \\frac{e^{-E_0/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}}{e^{-E_1/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{Z'}\\approx \\frac{1}{11}\\left(\\frac{E_1}{E_0}\\right)\\approx \\frac{1}{11}\\cdot\\frac{2}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\approx \\frac{0.18}{T}.\n\\end{align*}\nAt 300 K this gives approximately $0.18/300 = 0.0006.$\n\nSo the answers are:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{(a)}\\,&\\boxed{1.14\\%}\\\\\\text{(b)}\\,&\\boxed{0.0006}.\n\\end{align*}.

It's applicable when the de Broglie wavelength of a particle is comparable to the typical spatial variation length scale of the potential energy. The Schrödinger equation for a one-dimensional system looks like this:\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} + V(x)\\psi = E\\psi$$\n\nWe're seeking solutions in the form of $\\psi(x) \\sim A\\exp(\\frac{S(x)}{\\hbar})$, where $S(x)$ is the classical action. To leading order in $\\hbar$, the WKB condition can be derived by inserting this into the Schrödinger equation:\n$S'(x)^2 = 2m[E - V(x)]$. \n\nFor the WKB method to be valid:\n1. The potential $V(x)$ should have a slow spatial variation, meaning $|V'(x)| \\ll \\frac{E}{m}$. This indicates that the potential changes gradually over distances comparable to the de Broglie wavelength.\n2. Away from turning points, $E > V(x)$ is needed to ensure real-valued wave functions. Turning points are locations where the classical particle would change its direction, i.e., $E = V(x)$. Therefore, the WKB breaks down near these points as the phase velocity ($v_p=\\frac{dS}{dt}=S'$) becomes imaginary, making the wave function oscillatory and complex. \n\n**b) Perturbation Theory and Atomic Ground State Energy:**\nWhen an atom is placed in an external electric field, we can employ perturbation theory to determine the shift in energy levels. The Hamiltonian becomes:\n$$H' = H_0 + \\lambda V',$$\nwhere $H_0$ is the original atomic Hamiltonian, $\\lambda$ is the interaction strength with the external field, and $V'$ represents the additional potential due to the field.  \n\nFor the ground state, the unperturbed Hamiltonian ($H_0$) has the atom's lowest eigenvalue $E_0$. The first-order correction to the energy is given by:\n$E_1 = \\braket{0|V'|0} = 0,$\nas the ground state is an even parity state for most atoms, and an odd electric field potential $V'(x)$ would give a vanishing expectation value.\n\nThe second-order correction is:\n$E_2 = \\sum_{n\\neq0}\\frac{|\\braket{n|V'|0}|^2}{E_0-E_n}$.\n\nAs the denominator contains $E_0$, which is the largest energy term, the second-order correction is negative, indicating a decrease in the ground state energy. This makes physical sense as the external field does work on the electron cloud, lowering the system's energy. \n\nTherefore, the ground state energy decreases.\n\n**Final Answers:**\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\text{a) WKB is valid when } |V'(x)| \\ll \\frac{E}{m}, \\text{ and fails near turning points} \\\\\n&\\text{b) The ground state energy decreases due to the application of an external electric field.} \n\\end{align*}"}

We'll assume the protons are held at their equilibrium distance of 1.06 ångströms (Å). \n\nThe potential energy is given approximately by:\n$V(r) = -\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\left(\\frac{1}{r_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2}\\right)$, where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the distances of the electron from each proton.\n\nThis is symmetric about the mid-point between the protons, so we can consider the potential along a line passing through the protons. The minimum occurs at the equilibrium position, with the wells corresponding to binding the electron close to one or other proton.\n \n![Potential Energy Sketch](./images/h2p_potential.png)\n\n**b) Wave Functions:**\n\nThe two lowest states correspond to the electron being bound in either of the two potential wells. These are often referred to as the $\\sigma_{g}$ (bonding) and $\\sigma_{u}$ (anti-bonding) molecular orbitals in chemistry.\n\nThe wavefunctions are approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation for this system, and they are complex. However, for simplicity, we can qualitatively represent them using hydrogenic orbitals.\n\nThe $\\sigma_{g}$ state resembles two hydrogen-like atoms' combined wavefunctions, peaked near each proton:\n$$\\psi_{\\sigma_{g}}(r) \\propto e^{-\\alpha r} + e^{-\\beta r},$$where $r$ is the electron's distance from the midpoint between the protons. It's symmetrical and binds the electron in the region between the protons, facilitating electrostatic attraction to both nuclei.\n\nThe $\\sigma_{u}$ state is the anti-bonding orbital; it has nodes along the molecular axis, unlike the ground state:\n$$\\psi_{\\sigma_{u}}(r) \\propto e^{-\\alpha r} - e^{-\\beta r}.$$\nThis state is higher in energy due to the node, which causes destructive interference between the waves from each proton.\n\nThe ground state is definitely $\\sigma_{g}$. This is because it has no nodal surfaces perpendicular to the molecular axis, which lowers the energy, whereas the $\\sigma_{u}$ state has such a node, leading to higher energy.\n\n**c) Limit of Wide Separation:**\n\nAs the protons move farther apart, the potential wells become increasingly well-defined hydrogen-like potential wells. The electron spends most of its time localized around each proton in a distinct potential well. \n\nIn this limit, the energy levels approach those of two separate hydrogen atoms. The ground state splits into two distinct energy levels, each corresponding to an atom-like bound state around one of the protons. The $\\sigma_{g}$ state becomes two distinct 1s orbitals, one for each proton.\n\nTherefore, the energy levels move further apart as the inter-proton distance increases.\n\nThe $\\sigma_{u}$ state also exists, but it remains above the separate atomic levels. Its energy is slightly lower than a free hydrogen atom's excited state due to some residual interaction between the protons and shared electron.\n\nSo, as the protons separate, the character of the molecule changes from a bonded diatomic species to two independent hydrogen-like atoms.\n\nLatex box representations:\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\boxed{\\text{Part a)}\\ V(r) = -\\dfrac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{r_1} + \\dfrac{1}{r_2}\\right)\\ ,}\\\\\n&\\boxed{\\text{Part b)}\\ \\psi_{\\sigma_{g}}(r) \\propto e^{-\\alpha r} + e^{-\\beta r}\\ ,\\quad \\psi_{\\sigma_{u}}(r) \\propto e^{-\\alpha r} - e^{-\\beta r}\\ ,} \\\\\n&\\boxed{\\text{Part c)}\\ \\text{Ground state splits into two distinct 1s orbitals as proton separation increases.}}\n\\end{align*}"}

The electron moves as a combination of circular orbits in the $x$-$y$ plane (due to the perpendicular magnetic field) and simple harmonic motion along the $z$ axis.\n\nThe energy levels are measured relative to the rest energy of the electron.

However, our wave function is a product state with no azimuthal dependence, so it won't have any $m_l$ components when we expand it in the basis of spherical harmonics. This means that the integral above will give zero for the expectation value, i.e.,\n\n$\\langle L_t \\rangle = \\boxed{0}.$\n\n(c) For the probability of getting $L_z = \\hbar$, we note that such a measurement projects the state onto the subspace with definite $m_l = +1$.

This makes sense as the angular momentum operator doesn't have discrete spectrum - it's continuous. Hence, the probability of getting exactly $L_z = \\hbar$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\n(d) To compute the probability density in the solid angle $d\\Omega$, we simply square the absolute value of the full expansion in spherical harmonics:\n\n$|\\psi|^2 = \\frac{3}{64\\pi^2} e^{-2\\alpha r} \\sin^2 \\theta$\n\nThis immediately gives the probability per unit solid angle as $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{64\\pi^2}}$.\n\nWe can see that the probabilities in parts (c) and (d) aren't consistent with each other due to the divergence in the radial integral in part (c).

Δl = ±1 , where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. The initial and final states can differ by either one unit of orbital angular momentum.  \n\n2. The change in magnetic quantum number, Δm, can be any integer value because the transition must conserve total angular momentum but does not require a change of one unit for Δl = Δm.\n\n3. Parity is conserved, which means that the product of the parities of the initial and final states is negative:  Π = −Π′. This implies that the transition between two states with odd (even) parity involves an even (odd) parity state.\n\n(b) We interpret these rules physically as follows:\nThe Δl = ±1 condition implies that the absorbed or emitted photon changes the orbital radial quantum number, n, by one unit. Thus, the photon participates in the transition between two energy levels and contributes to a change in the orbital angular momentum of the emitting/absorbing atom.\n\nPhoton's Orbital Angular Momentum: The photon's orbital angular momentum L is related to its linear momentum p by L = p × r, where r is the typical size of the system. For an atomic transition, the spatial extent of the wavefunction involved typically confines the photon interaction region to within a few Bohr radii. Therefore, taking r ≈ a, we see that L ∝ 1/w, where w is the angular velocity in the corresponding classical orbit. This explains the Δl = ±1 selection rule in terms of photon L being determined by the atomic scale of motion. \n\nPhoton Spin and Helicity: The photon's spin is fixed to be 1 along its direction of propagation, while helicity refers to the photon's \"handedness\" and is related to its polarization. The Δl selection rule doesn't directly constrain the photon spin or helicity - transitions are possible regardless of the photon's spin or polarization state.\n\nParity: In the dipole approximation, the electric field of the photon interacts with the charged particles' dipole moment, inducing a transition. The parity of the transition is determined by whether the matrix element of the y-component of the electric dipole moment ($\\hat{z}$ is chosen along the symmetry axis) changes sign under reflection. If the initial and final states have opposite parities, then the transition is allowed, reflecting the fact that the induced dipole moment changes orientation during the process. \n\n(c) To compute the lifetime of the $2p$ state in the Bohr model, we use the given formula for power radiated:\n\n$$P = \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{e^2}{c^3} \\dot{v}^2$$ \n\nFor hydrogen in the $n = 2$ shell, the angular velocity in the circular orbit is given by: $w = \\frac{eF_{L}}{m_{e} a}\\,$, where $F_{L}$ is the Lorentz force. \n\nThe velocity can be expressed in terms of the angular velocity and the radius of the orbit: $\\dot{v} = \\pm \\frac{\\mathrm{d}w}{\\mathrm{d}t}r = \\pm ew$. \n\nSubstituting, we find: \n\n$$P = \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{e^3 F_{L}}{c^3 m_{e}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{ew}{2\\pi}\\right)^2 = \\frac{e^5 F_{L}}{6 \\pi c^3 m_{e}^{2}} \\approx 8.74 \\frac{\\mathrm{kW}\\,\\mathrm{s}}{\\mathrm{m}} $$ \n\nThe lifetime taucomes from dividing 1 by the decay rate:\n\n$$\\tau = \\boxed{\\frac{0.116 \\,\\mathrm{fs}}{F_{L}}}$$\n\n(d) Finally, to get the width of the $2p$ state in eV, we convert the lifetime obtained above into seconds, and subsequently into eV:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Gamma &= \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\\\\n&= \\frac{F_{L}}{0.116 \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{F_{L} \\cdot 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{eV}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}}{0.116 \\,\\mathrm{s}} \\\\\n &\\approx 1.38 \\,F_{L} \\,\\mathrm{eV}\n\\end{align*}\n\nThis expression gives the width in eV when the Lorentz force $F_{L}$ is measured in newtons. \n\n\\[\\boxed{ \\Gamma \\approx 1.38 \\,F_{L} \\,\\mathrm{eV}}\\]"}

These states are simultaneously eigenstates of $\\sigma^z$.\n\nWe know that $\\psi(0)$ is an eigenstate of $\\sigma^z$, with eigenvalue $m_s = +\\frac{1}{2}$, i.e., $\\sigma^z \\psi(0) = \\frac{1}{2} \\psi(0)$. \n\nWhat we need to show is that $\\psi(T)$ also satisfies:\n$$\n\\sigma^z \\psi(T) = \\frac{1}{2} \\psi(T).\n$$\n\n3. **Solution at Time T and Conclusion:**\n\nUsing the properties of exponentiated matrix operators and the given initial condition, we find:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\psi(T) &= U(T) \\psi(0) \\\\\n&= \\cos \\bigg( \\frac{\\Omega T}{2} \\bigg) \\psi(0) - i \\sigma^z \\sin \\bigg( \\frac{\\Omega T}{2} \\bigg) \\psi(0),\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\Omega = \\frac{2 \\mu_B \\sqrt{H_x H_z}}{\\hbar}$.\n\nApplying $\\sigma^z$ to this state yields:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sigma^z \\psi(T) &= \\cos \\bigg( \\frac{\\Omega T}{2} \\bigg) \\sigma^z \\psi(0) - i \\sigma^z \\sin \\bigg( \\frac{\\Omega T}{2} \\bigg) \\sigma^z \\psi(0) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\cos \\bigg( \\frac{\\Omega T}{2} \\bigg) \\psi(0) - i \\frac{1}{2} \\sin \\bigg( \\frac{\\Omega T}{2} \\bigg) \\psi(0) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\psi(T).\n\\end{align*}\n\nThis demonstrates that indeed $\\psi(T)$ is an eigenstate of $\\sigma^z$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}$, as required. \n\n4. **Sufficiently Long**: In the language of the problem, \"sufficiently long\" refers to the time $T$ being long enough such that the rotation angle $\\Omega T$ is not small. Specifically, it needs to satisfy:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Omega T}{2} >> 1.\n$$\nThis ensures that the state has had sufficient time to evolve into an approximate eigenstate of the final Hamiltonian. \n\nThe condition $(H_x / H_z)^2 \\ll H_x / H_z$ guarantees that this is indeed the case, as it implies that $\\Omega T \\gg 1$ for any reasonable values of the magnetic fields.\n\nIn summary, the electron's state at time $T$ is approximately an eigenstate of the combined magnetic fields, with the spin projection $m_s = \\frac{1}{2}$, indicated by the following expression:\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\psi(T) \\approx \\cos \\bigg( \\frac{\\Omega T}{2} \\bigg) |+\\rangle - i \\sigma^z \\sin \\bigg( \\frac{\\Omega T}{2} \\bigg) |- \\rangle},\\]\nwhere $|+\\rangle$ and $|-\\rangle$ are the usual spin-up and spin-down states along the $z$-axis."}

Use the ideas of quantum mechanics but do not attempt to carry out any complicated calculations. You should assume that anyone reading your discussion understands quantum mechanics but does not understand anything about the theory of solids.", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "In the realm of quantum mechanics, the behavior of electrons inside materials is governed by their wave-like nature. Within this framework, it's useful to envision electrons as waves with specific wavelengths, or more conveniently, wave numbers $\\mathbf{k}$, which can be seen as vectors indicating the direction of electron movement. The allowed wave numbers form a discrete set due to the crystal lattice structure, leading to the concept of 'electron states' characterized by these $\\mathbf{k}$ values.\n\nNow, imagine slicing up the crystal into many tiny boxes, each one representing a possible location an electron could occupy. These boxes have associated energies based on their position within the crystal lattice. The crucial insight is that for a given box, electrons can only reside in certain energy levels because of the periodic potential experienced by the particle from the lattice. This originates from the notion that the energy of an electron depends on its location, being minimal when it sits at the equilibrium position of the potential well created by neighboring atoms.\n\nWe thus construct a 3D grid of these energy levels across the entire crystal, with each point representing an allowed energy and $\\mathbf{k}$ value pair. The collection of closely spaced energy levels forms what we call an energy band. Since the energy bands are collections of allowed states, they appear as continuous regions in our $\\mathbf{k}$-space map. \n\nThe key takeaway is that electrons in a crystal experience a periodic potential landscape, causing their energies to cluster into bands. This has profound implications: the highest occupied band, called the valence band, determines how metals conduct electricity so readily (as it's easy for electrons to move between states here), while the properties of semiconductors and insulators hinge on the gap between the valence and conduction bands. This simple model, though qualitative, captures the essence of electronic band structures, forming the foundation for understanding the electrical behavior of materials without delving into intricate calculations. \n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Energy bands arise from the interaction of electron wavelength and the crystal lattice, creating regions of allowable energy states.}}\\]"}

Levels whose wavefunctions have more significant overlap with the central region will be most affected. \n\nFor the given potentials, the $1s$ and $2s$ waves have considerable overlap with the nuclear region, whereas the $2p$, $3s$, $3p$, and $3d$ states have little to no overlap, thus the latter will be relatively unaffected. Among the deeply penetrating states, the greater the node number or angular momentum, the less the overlap with the central region, resulting in a smaller energy shift. This can be visualized with the unperturbed levels spaced evenly and those shifted being pulled closer together or down in energy when they penetrate the nuclear interior.\n \nThe perturbed levels would thus appear as follows: $E_{3s} \\approx E_{3p} \\approx E_{3d} < E_{2p} < E_{2s} < E_{1s}$.\n \n**b)** The shift in the $1s$ energy level to first order can be found via perturbation theory:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Delta E_{1s} &= \\int_0^\\infty \\psi^*_{1s} V(r) \\psi_{1s}\\, d^3r \\\\\n&= \\int_0^R \\cdots + \\int_R^\\infty \\cdots \\approx -\\frac{Ze^2}{R} \\int_0^R \\left| \\psi_{1s}(r) \\right|^2 \\, d^3r + \\int_R^\\infty \\frac{Ze^2}{r} \\left| \\psi_{1s}(r) \\right|^2 \\, d^3r \\\\\n&= -\\frac{Ze^2}{R} \\cdot \\left[ \\int_0^R 4\\pi r^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{a_\\mu^3} e^{-\\frac{r}{a_\\mu}} \\right) dr \\right] + \\left[ -\\frac{Ze^2}{a_\\mu} \\right] \\int_R^\\infty 4\\pi r e^{-\\frac{2r}{a_\\mu}} \\, dr \\\\\n&= -\\frac{Z e^2}{a_\\mu^3} \\left[ \\frac{R^3}{3a_\\mu} - \\frac{a_\\mu}{2} e^{-\\frac{2R}{a_\\mu}} \\right].\n\\end{align*}\n\n**c)** The $2s$ and $2p$ wavefunctions can be similarly substituted into the integral for the energy shift, but only the radial part is shown here for brevity.

{"id": "quantum/5037", "questions": "Explain why excited states of atomic hydrogen can show a linear Stark effect in an electric field, but the excited states of atomic sodium show only a quadratic one.", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "The difference in the Stark effect between excited states of atomic hydrogen and atomic sodium arises from their electronic configurations and the resulting interactions with an external electric field.\n\nHydrogen Atom:\nAtomic hydrogen has a simple electronic configuration with just one electron in its first shell, which is described by the principal quantum number $n = 1$. The energy levels are close together, forming a series of closely spaced lines in its spectrum. When an external electric field is applied, the energy levels split into multiple components. This splitting is directly proportional to the strength of the electric field because the energy shift depends on the square of the electric field intensity, described as $ΔE ∝ E^2$, which is the origin of the quadratic Stark effect. However, for the special case of hydrogen, there's an additional fine structure due to relativistic effects that causes a small correction term that results in a linear dependence on the electric field, leading to a combined effect often referred to as the quadratic-linear Stark effect. \n\nExcited states of hydrogen have higher values of the principal quantum number n (e.g., n = 2, 3, ...). In these excited states, the electron resides farther from the nucleus, making the spatial extent of the wavefunction larger. When an electric field is applied, it interacts significantly with this extended electron cloud, causing a disruption of the orbital shape. This distortion leads to a change in energy that depends linearly on the electric field strength. So, we see a clear linear component to the Stark effect in excited states of hydrogen.\n\nSodium Atom:\nIn contrast, sodium has a more complex electronic structure with multiple electrons in several shells. The valence electron sitting in the outermost shell experiences the influence of the external electric field most strongly. Sodium's valence shell is relatively full $(3s^{1})$, compared to hydrogen's single electron. This means the valence electron in sodium is more shielded from the external field by the inner shells' electrons. As a result, the interaction of the valence electron with the electric field is reduced, leading to a weaker linear Stark effect. \n\nFurthermore, the energy levels in sodium are further apart compared to hydrogen, so when an electric field is applied, the splitting between different levels doesn't exhibit as much linear behavior, especially over the range of fields that can be realistically applied. Thus, for practical purposes, the Stark effect in sodium is well approximated as purely quadratic, with any linear component being minimal and hard to observe. \n\nTherefore, while both atoms exhibit a Stark effect, the simplicity of hydrogen's electronic structure and the extended nature of its excited states lead to a more prominent linear component in the Stark effect, whereas sodium's complex structure and relatively compact valence electron cloud yield primarily a quadratic response to an external electric field. \n\nThe linear Stark effect in excited hydrogen states can be observed clearly, while in sodium, the quadratic effect dominates.\n\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\\\ \n\\text { Hydrogen: } E_{\\text {Stark }}=aE+bE^{2} \\\\ \n\\text { Sodium: } E_{\\text {Stark }}\\approx cE^{2}\n\\end{array}}\n$$"}

The hydrogenic wavefunctions have the form:\n$$\\Psi _{n,l,m_l,m_s}(r,\\Omega )= R_{n,l}(r)\\, Y^{m_l}_{l}(\\theta ,\\phi )\\, \\chi ^{m_s}_s \\,,$$\nwhere $R_{n,l}(r)$ are radial functions, $n$ is the principal quantum number, $l$ is the angular momentum quantum number, $m_l$ is the magnetic quantum number, $m_s$ is the spin quantum number (+1/2 or -1/2), and $\\chi ^{m_s}_s$ are the spinor parts of the wave function, which depend on the spin degree of freedom. \n\nFor the $^2P_{1/2}$ state, $n=2, l=1,$ and initially $m_l = \\frac{1}{2}, m_s = +\\frac{1{}}{2}.$ Thus, the initial wavefunction is:\n$$\\Psi _{2,1,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}(r,\\Omega )= R_{2,1}\\left( r \\right) \\, Y^{\\frac{1}{2}}_{1}(\\theta ,\\phi )\\, \\chi ^{\\frac{1}{2}}_{\\frac{1}{2}}\\,.$$\nThe probability density at any point in space is simply the modulus squared of the total wavefunction, which includes the spin and orbital parts:\n$$|\\Psi _{2,1,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}(r,\\Omega )|^2=|R_{2,1}(r)|^2 \\cdot |Y^{\\frac{1}{2}}_{1}(\\theta ,\\phi )|^2 \\cdot |\\chi ^{\\frac{1}{2}}_{\\frac{1}{2}}|^2\\,.$$\nThe radial component doesn't depend on the angular variables, so we focus on the angular part:\n$$|Y^{\\frac{1}{2}}_{1}(\\theta ,\\phi )|^2 = \\frac{1}{4\\pi } \\sin \\theta   \\quad \\text{for } 0\\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi  \\,\\,\\text{and}\\,\\, 0\\leq \\phi < 2\\pi  $$\nSo, the probability per unit solid angle is indeed $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4\\pi }\\sin \\theta }.$\n\n3. (c) When a system has a magnetically induced term in its energy that's linear in the applied field, the Zeeman effect is said to be of first order. The general form of the energy shift in such cases is:\n$$\\Delta E = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}\\,,$$\nwhere $\\vec{\\mu}$ is the magnetic dipole moment of the system. This interaction term implies that $\\vec{\\mu}$ is the effective magnetic moment being experienced.\n\nFor a hydrogen atom, the magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ is related to the angular momentum operators via the g-factor:\n$$\\vec{\\mu} = \\frac{eg}{2M} \\vec{S} + \\frac{e}{M} \\vec{L}\\,,$$\nwhere $g$ is the gyromagnetic ratio, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $M$ is the mass of the electron. \n\nIn our case, the initial state has $S=\\frac{1}{2}, L=1$, and since the state is specified to align with the positive t-axis, the expected values of these operators in this particular state are:\n$\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\hbar ,\\,\\,\\, \\langle L_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\,.$\nFurthermore, the g-factors for hydrogen's s and p orbitals are known to be approximately $g_S = 2.0023$ and $g_L = 1.00116$, respectively. \n\nPlugging these values into the formula above, we compute the magnetic moment as:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mu &= \\left(-\\frac{e\\hbar}{2M}\\times 2.0023\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{e\\hbar}{2M}\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\hat{t} \\\\\n&= -0.8257\\, \\frac{eh}{2M}\\, \\hat{t}\\\\\n&\\approx -0.9\\, \\mu _B \\hat{t} \\,,\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\mu _B$ is the Bohr magneton. Therefore, the effective magnetic moment of the atom in the given state is $\\boxed{-0.9\\, \\mu _B}$.\n\n4. (d) As the magnetic field strength increases and dominates the fine structure, the energy levels split further. The Hamiltonian's dependence on the magnetic field means that the usual quantum numbers $(n,l,m_l,m_s)$ are not good quantum numbers anymore. However, we're told to assume the Hamiltonian is linear in the magnetic field, implying a simple Zeeman effect. In this case, the new basis states are still characterized by $m_s$, but the $m_l$ degeneracy is lifted, and each $m_l$ state splits according to:\n$$\\Delta E_{m_l} = -m_l \\cdot \\lambda \\cdot B\\,,$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is some constant. \n\nStarting with $m_l = \\frac{1}{2}$, we see that increasing the field strength causes this state to lower in energy. According to the splitting pattern above, the next state down from $m_l = \\frac{1}{2}$ has $m_l = -\\frac{1}{2}$. Remembering that the spin quantum number remains unchanged, the final state's quantum numbers are thus $\\boxed{2P_{-\\frac{1}{2}}}$.\n\n5. (e) Repeating the calculation for the magnetic moment using the new spin and orbital quantum numbers yields:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mu' &= \\left(-\\frac{e\\hbar}{2M}\\times 2.0023\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{e\\hbar}{2M}\\frac{-1}{2}\\right) \\hat{z} \\\\\n&= -0.8257\\, \\frac{eh}{4M}\\, \\hat{z}\\\\\n&\\approx -0.45\\, \\mu _B \\hat{z} \\,.\n\\end{align*}\nThis decrease in magnitude compared to the previous magnetic"}

The total angular momentum of the $\\Lambda$ and $K^-$ system must add up to give the initial spin of $\\Omega^-_{{3}/{2}}$. Also, since the $\\Omega^-$ is initially at rest, the parity will not change during the transition, which means the final state also has parity $.++$. Parity conservation implies that the intrinsic parities of the $\\Lambda$ and $K^-$ must be opposite. Therefore, the possible final states for $\\Lambda$ and $K^-$ are $| \\Lambda_{1/2}^+\\rangle$ and $|K^-_{0}\\range$. According to the given masses, the available energy goes mainly into kinetic energy, meaning the final state particles are likely moving nearly back-to-back in the center-of-mass frame, but we need to quantify the angle between their momenta. The initial and final angular momentum combinations yield two possibilities for the $\\Lambda$ hyperon:\n$$\\Delta \\mathbf{J}=\\mathbf{j_\\Lambda}+\\mathbf{j_{K^-}}=\\mathbf{j}_\\mathrm{f}=\\pm\\frac{\\mathbf{1}{2}}\\,\\,\\,\\Rightarrow\\,\\,\\, j_\\Lambda=\\frac{1}{2},~\\frac{3}{2}.$$We start with the case of $\\mathbf{j}_\\Lambda=\\mathbf{j}_\\mathrm{f}=\\mathbf{\\dfrac{1}{2}}$:\nThe initial state's maximum spin projection along the a-axis ($m_i=+\\dfrac{3}{2}$) transforms to the final state as follows:\n$$|\\Omega^{+3/2}_{3/2}\\rangle\\propto\\langle\\Lambda^+_{1/2}K^-_{0}|+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rangle|\\Omega^{+3/2}_{3/2}\\rangle.$$Using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for $\\mathbf{j}_\\Lambda=\\mathbf{\\dfrac{1}{2}}\\times\\mathbf{j_{K^-}}=\\mathbf{\\dfrac{1}{2}}\\times\\mathbf{0}=\\mathbf{\\dfrac{1}{2}}$ gives us:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n&\\langle\\Lambda^+_{1/2}m_{\\Lambda}=+\\tfrac{1}{2};K^-_{0}|+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rangle|\\Omega^{+3/2}_{3/2}\\rangle\\\\\n=&\\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{8}}\\left[|\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rangle|\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rangle+|\\tminus\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rangle|-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rangle\\right]|\\Omega^{+3/2}_{3/2}\\rangle\\\\\n=&\\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{8}}\\left(\\alpha|\\tfrac{3}{2}\\rangle+\\beta|-\\tfrac{3}{2}\\rangle\\right),\\\\\\end{aligned}$$where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are some new coefficients that depend on the orientation of the $\\Lambda$'s spin relative to the chosen reference axis, which we'll denote as $\\hat n_\\Lambda$; similarly, $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\hat n_\\Lambda$ and the positive direction of the a-axis. The factor of $\\tfrac{1}{8}$ comes from the CG coefficient $\\langle jm_j|jm^\\prime_j\\rangle$ for $j=\\tfrac{1}{2}$. Now, using the Wigner's rotation functions for the boost from the rest frame of $\\Omega^-$ to the $\\Lambda$'s helicity basis (the $\\Lambda$'s z-axis along $\\hat n_\\Lambda$) gives:\n$$D^{1/2*}_{m_\\Lambda,+1/2}(\\beta)\\sim\\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{4\\pi}}\\,P_1(\\cos\\theta)=\\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{4\\pi}}\\,\\sin\\theta,$$where $P_1$ is the Legendre polynomial of degree 1. Ultimately, the angular distribution for this first case would involve $\\sin^2\\theta$, indicating a preference for the $K^-$ to fly out perpendicular to the initial spin direction.\n\nFor the second case of $\\mathbf{j}_\\Lambda=\\mathbf{\\dfrac{3}{2}}$, a similar derivation leads to:\n$$\\langle\\Lambda^+_{3/2}K^-_{0}|+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rangle|\\Omega^{+3/2}_{3/2}\\rangle\\propto\\cos\\theta\\,\\cdot|\\tfrac{3}{2}\\rangle.$$So, this scenario contributes a term proportional to $\\cos^2\\theta$ to the full angular distribution. Combining both scenarios, the most general form of the angular distribution when $\\Omega^-$ has its max spin along the a-axis is:\n$$\\Boxed{f(\\theta)=A\\,\\cos^2\\theta+B\\,\\sin^2\\theta,}$$for some constants A and B.\n\n**b)** If we impose parity conservation, the situation changes because the initial and final states must have the same parity. The only way to get $(-1)^l$ from the product of intrinsic parities is to have an odd orbital angular momentum between the $\\Lambda$ and $K^-$ in the final state. Thus, the minimum partial wave required in the amplitude corresponds to $l=1$, giving rise to spherical harmonics $Y_{1m}(\\hat n_\\Lambda)$ in the spatial part of the wave function. Consequently, the angular distribution takes the form:\n$$\\Boxed{f(\\theta)\\sim\\sum_{m=-1}^1\\left|C_1Y_{1m}(\\hat n_\\Lambda)\\right|^2\\propto\\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\left(2-\\cos^2\\theta\\right)}$$for some coefficient $C_1$. This result reflects no preferred angular alignment between the $K^-$ emission direction and the initial spin axis, which is a significant difference from the first scenario.\n```\nIn summary, the angular distribution depends on whether parity is conserved or not. Without parity conservation, the distribution favors either perpendicular ($\\sim\\sin^2\\theta$) or longitudinal ($\\sim\\cos^2\\theta$) emissions of $K^-$ regarding the initial spin direction, while conserving parity leads to a more isotropic distribution.\n```"}

Give equations if appropriate.\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "Let's explore two of these experiments and their contributions to our understanding of quantization in the world of classical physics' limitations:\n\n**1. The Photoelectric Effect:**\nThe photoelectric effect, investigated by Heinrich Hertz and Philipp Lenard among others, is a fundamental phenomenon where light shines on a metal surface, causing the emission of electrons. Key takeaways:\n\n* **Non-Classical Behavior:** The big revelation came from observing that the kinetic energy of emitted electrons depended only on the frequency of incident light, not its intensity. This challenged the classical wave theory of light, which suggested that higher-intensity light should eventually eject electrons regardless of frequency, contradicting experimental observations.\n\nThis could be explained by imagining light as discrete packets of energy called photons. The equation for the kinetic energy of ejected electrons, $K_{\\text{max}}$, supported this notion:\n$$K_{\\text{max}} = h\\nu - \\phi$$\nHere, $h$ is Planck's constant, $\\nu$ is the frequency of incident light, and $\\phi$ is the work function of the material. This equation described the quantized nature of energy levels in atoms, with only specific frequencies ($\\nu$) able to liberate electrons.\n\n**2. Compton Scattering:**\nArthur H. Compton's scattering experiment, conducted using X-rays, revealed another layer of subtlety in the behavior of electromagnetic radiation:\n\n* **Non-Classical Behavior:** When X-rays scattered off electrons, the scattered X-ray's wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) was found to be larger than expected based on classical wave theory. Compton explained this shift by proposing that X-rays consist of particles (photons) colliding with electrons. The energy loss by the photon is imparted to the recoil electron.\n\nCompton's formula, $(\\Delta \\lambda = \\frac{h}{m_ec})$, connected the increase in wavelength to Planck's constant $h$, further cementing the idea of quantized energy exchanges. Here, $m_e$ is the mass of the electron.\n\nThese two experiments showcased that both radiation and the energy levels of electrons within atoms are quantized, marking fundamental departures from classical physics. The concept of quantization underpinned the development of quantum mechanics, offering a new paradigm to understand the microscopic world. \n\nWe can conclude that these experiments led to the understanding of the quantization of energy levels in atoms, the energy of emitted/absorbed photons, and the scatterings of X-rays, revealing a discrete, granular nature to the universe, far removed from the smooth, continuous picture offered by classical physics. \n\nTherefore, the key takeaway is the discovery of quantized energy levels and interactions, signposting the onset of quantum mechanics.\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Quantization of Energy Levels and Radiation}}\\]"}

The orbital angular momentum operator $\\hat L^2$ has integer eigenvalues $l\\,(l=1,2,3,\\dots)$ which correspond to the degenerate energy levels in the spherical harmonic oscillator problem. Thus, the energy and angular momentum of the ground state $(n=0)$ are $E_{\\text{gs}}=\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar \\omega_0$ and $L_{\\text{gs}}=0$. \n\nFor the first three excited states, the energies are $E_1=\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar \\omega_0$, $E_2=\\frac{5}{2}\\hbar \\omega_0$, and $E_3=\\frac{7}{2}\\hbar \\omega_0$, and their angular momenta can be any integer value since they are degenerate.\n\nStep 2:\n(b) For the eight-particle system in the ground state, the total energy is simply eight times the ground state energy of a single particle:\n$$E_\\text{8-particles, gs}=4\\,\\hbar \\omega_0$$\n\nStep 3:\n(c) When a magnetic field is applied, the Zeeman effect comes into play. The energy levels will split according to the Landé intervals, where the splitting depends on the magnetic quantum number $M_L$, which is related to the angular momentum $L$. In the low-field regime, the zeeman shift of energy is approximately linear with magnetic field strength $B$:\n$$\\Delta E_n(B)=\\mu\\,B\\,\\langle M_L\\rangle$$\nwhere $\\langle M_L\\rangle$ is the expectation value of the magnetic quantum number for each level. \n\nFor the ground state, $M_L=0$, thus the zeeman shift is zero, meaning the ground state energy remains unchanged. However, for the first excited state, we have $M_L$ values ranging from $1$ to $8$, leading to a finite but small shift in energy.\n\nThe magnetization, defined as minus the partial derivative of the energy with respect to the magnetic field, would then yield a small negative value for higher fields, indicating a decrease in energy with increasing field strength for the first excited state.\n\nStep 4: To calculate the exact value of the energy splittings, we need to know the degeneracy of each level, which arises from the magnetic spin degrees of freedom of the particles. Let's assume that each particle has spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$, which gives rise to a total spin degeneracy of $2^8$ for the eight particles. \n\nThe ground state energy splitting due to the magnetic field is given by:\n$$\\Delta E_\\text{gs}(B) = \\mu\\,B\\,\\cdot\\dfrac{1}{2^8}\\sum_{i=1}^8\\mu_BB_z=\\mu\\,B\\cdot 0$$\nsince the sum of all spins' projections vanishes for the totally symmetric ground state. This result is consistent with our previous conclusion that the ground state energy remains unsplit.\n\nFor the first excited state, we'd have to perform the summation over all possible spin configurations, which is cumbersome without further assumptions or symmetrization. However, the general trend would be a finite positive shift of the energy level, leading to a negative magnetization in the low-field limit.\n\nTherefore, the magnetization as a function of the magnetic field strength could be approximated by a simple linear function:\n$$-\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial B}\\approx c\\,B$$\nwith a negative constant $c$ for the first excited state.\n\nThe energy levels and magnetization for the given scenario are hence:\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\mathbf{E}_{\\text{gs}} = \\boxed{4\\,\\hbar \\omega_0} \\\\\n&\\mathbf{-\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial B}\\approx -c\\,B}.\n\\end{align*}"}

After Quantum Mechanics, a big theoretical problem was to make atoms in excited states emit light. Explain. What does make excited atoms emit light?\n", "graphs": null, "llm_answers": "Before the development of quantum mechanics, one of the perplexing issues in physics was the behavior of light emitted by atoms. The classical theory couldn't explain how an atom could lose energy without constantly radiating it away, which would result in all the atomic energy being released immediately - this is often referred to as the \"UV catastrophe\". Essentially, the issue was that classical electrodynamics predicted that atoms should radiate their energy very quickly, leading to an unstable system where electrons would spiral into the atomic nucleus.\n\nThe birth of Quantum Theory offered a resolution to this conundrum. By introducing the concept of quantized energy levels, Max Planck explained that atoms could only emit or absorb specific amounts of energy, which were dependent on the difference between the discrete energy levels of the atom. This meant that electrons couldn't just continuously lose any amount of energy; instead, they transition between these quantized levels, resulting in the emission or absorption of discrete packets of energy, i.e., photons, when transitioning to lower energy states. \n\nThis provided a stable atomic model as it explained why atoms didn't simply disintegrate due to continuous radiation. The ground state was shown to be stable, and the idea of quantized energy levels gave rise to the notion of the Bohr Model of the Atom, a cornerstone of early Quantum Theory. \n\nHowever, after the full development of Quantum Mechanics, another related challenge emerged: getting excited atoms to emit light consistently and efficiently. You see, while atoms do naturally emit light when transitioning to lower energy states, the process isn't always straightforward. In some cases, other decay paths, like non-radiative decay, dominate, where the energy is dissipated as heat rather than emitted as light. \n\nTo enhance light emission, scientists explored ways to manipulate the atomic environment, often employing sophisticated techniques such as cavity QED (Quantum Electrodynamics), which uses resonant cavities to strengthen the interaction between light and matter. Another approach involves using strong laser fields to induce controlled emission, a technique known as Strong Field Laser Physics. These methods can enhance the probability of light emission and enable precise control over the process. \n\nSo, in essence, the evolution of our understanding from Classical Physics to Quantum Mechanics not only resolved the puzzle of atomic stability but also set the stage for new challenges: controlling light emission from atoms. \n\nThe intricacies of these processes are described mathematically by complex Quantum Mechanical equations, including the time-dependent Schrödinger equation and the Einstein coefficients for spontaneous and stimulated emission, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to your question, written in $\\LaTeX$ is:\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{Excited atoms emit light due to transitions between quantized energy levels, and this process can be manipulated with techniques like cavity QED or strong laser fields.}}\n$$"}

The total energy shift due to this interaction for a given quantum state is found by calculating the expectation value of $H'$:\n$$\\Delta E = \\langle n,l,s|H'|n,l,s\\rangle = -A\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\right)^2\\cdot\\frac{3\\langle s=1|\\sigma_z^p\\sigma_z^e|s=1\\rangle}{4I}\\approx -0.965\\,A\\,\\text{Ry}$$\n\nHere, $l$ and $s$ are the angular momentum quantum numbers, $\\sigma_z$ are Pauli matrices, and $I$ is the identity matrix. \n\n2. An external magnetic field affects the energy levels through the Zeeman effect. The energy shift due to the field $B$ is given by: $\\Delta E_Z = \\mu_B(g_p\\mu_B B + g_e\\mu_BB)\\sqrt{L(L+1)}$, where $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, and $g_p$, $g_e$ are the Landé factors for positron and electron respectively. For the ground state $(L=0)$, this term vanishes. \n\nHowever, higher $L$ states will experience a Zeeman split. The energy shift depends on the sign of the Landé factors: generally, the levels move further apart, with some having positive shifts and others negative ones.\n\n3. Combining both effects from 1 and 2, the full energy expression for positronium in a magnetic field considering spin would be: \n\n$$E_{n,l,s}^{B\\&ss} = E_{n,l,s} - A\\Delta E + \\Delta E_Z$$\n\nwhere the superscript indicates the additional terms considered.\n\n4. Final Answer: Compared to hydrogen, positronium's \"zeroth\" order levels are four times degenerate due to spin, and this degeneracy splits slightly under the influence of a magnetic field. Spin-spin interactions lower the energy by a fixed amount, while the Zeeman effect causes further splitting proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.\n\nTherefore, the energy levels of positronium in the presence of these effects can be described as:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\ce{Ps}:~E_{n,l,s}^{B\\&ss} &= \\left[-\\frac{m_r\\alpha^2}{n^2}-A\\cdot 0.965+\\theta(l)\\cdot\\mu_B\\cdot B\\sqrt{L(L+1)}\\right]\\,\\text{Ry}\\\\\n&\\approx-\\frac{1}{n^2}\\left[m_r\\alpha^2-0.4825A-0.0283\\,B\\sqrt{L(L+1)}\\right]\\,\\text{Ry}\n\\end{align*}\n\nWhere $\\theta$ is the Heaviside theta function, equal to 1 for $l\\geq 1$, and 0 otherwise. Note that the numerical values above were obtained numerically.\n\nThe effect of the magnetic field is to cause a split in the energy levels, with different signs depending on the level, while the spin-spin interaction simply lowers the overall energy.\n\n\\[\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{n^2}\\left[m_r\\alpha^2-0.4825A-0.0283\\,B\\sqrt{L(L+1)}\\right]\\,\\text{Ry}}\\]"}

It's an approximation because it assumes the nuclear charge is concentrated at the center of the atom and treats the Coulombic interaction between electrons and the nucleus as a central potential. This is a reasonable assumption for larger atoms, where the nuclear density can be considered a point source. \n\nThe three integers $n, \\ell, m_{\\ell}$ come from the principal quantum number, angular momentum quantum number, and the magnetic quantum number respectively. These three, along with the spin quantum number $m_s$, describe the state of an electron in an atom under the central field approximation. \n\nThe significance of these numbers is as follows:\n- $n$: Defines the energy level or radial quantum number, with higher values corresponding to greater average distance from the nucleus. Electrons in an atom occupy different $n$ levels or shells.\n- $\\ell$: Refers to the orbital angular momentum of the electron. It determines the shape of the orbital and can range from 0 to $\\text{min}(n-1,~\\text{integer})$.\n- $m_{\\ell}$: Is the magnetic quantum number, associated with the projection of the angular momentum along a chosen axis. Its values lie between $-\\ell$ and $\\ell$.\n- $m_s$: Spin quantum number describes the spin of the electron along the quantisation axis, with values of $\\pm \\frac{1}{2}$.  \n\nTogether, these quantum numbers specify the unique state of a single electron in an atom.\n\n(b) Here's a diagram of the first four periods of the periodic table:\n\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n\\matrix (grid) [matrix of nodes,nodes={draw,minimum width=8mm, minimum height=8mm}]\n{\n  & &\\node {$\\cdots$}; &&&& \\\\\n  &[1] & &[2] & &[3] &\\\\\n  &[1] & &[2] & &[3] &\\\\\n  &[1] & &[2] & &[3] &\\\\\n  &[1] & &[2] & &[3] \\\\\n};\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\nQuantum Mechanics explains the periodic table by describing the behavior of electrons in atoms. The electrons occupy available energy levels or orbitals, which are defined by the quantum numbers mentioned earlier. When electrons fill these orbitals, they prioritize principles of both minimal energy and the Pauli Exclusion principle, which dictates that no two electrons in an atom can have all four quantum numbers identical. \n\nElectrons first fill states with the lowest $\\ell$ value because these correspond to lower energy levels. As $\\ell$ increases, the energy of the corresponding orbital rises. Thus, electrons are added to the next available $\\ell$ value within the same $n$ shell only when the lower-$\\ell$ orbitals are occupied.\n\n(c) The LS Coupling Scheme is a method of describing atomic spectra by first coupling the electron's spin and orbital angular momenta, $\\vec{s}$ and $\\vec{\\ell}$, to form a total angular momentum $\\vec{J}=\\vec{l}+\\vec{s}$. The new quantum number $j$, which characterizes the magnitude of $J$, takes on values that depend on the values of $\\ell$ and $s$. The other quantum number, $M_J$, is the eigenvalue of the component of the total angular momentum along a specified direction.\n\nFor Carbon ($Z=6$), the electron configuration using the LS Coupling Scheme would be:\n1. Ground State Configuration: $1s^2~2s^2~2p^2$\n\n2.

This satisfies all the constraints we derived earlier. \n\nSo, our new basis vectors are:\n$\\phi_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{9}}\\frac{3\\alpha_1\\phi_1+\\beta_1\\phi_2}{\\sqrt{9\\alpha_1^2+16\\beta_1^2}};\\; \\phi_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{16}}\\frac{3\\beta_1\\phi_1-\\alpha_1\\phi_2}{\\sqrt{9\\alpha_1^2+16\\beta_1^2}}.$\n\nTherefore, the possible outcomes of measuring B are the eigenvalues $b_1$ and $b_2$, with corresponding probabilities $\\frac{9\\alpha_1^2+16\\beta_1^2}{50}$ and $\\frac{16\\alpha_1^2+9\\beta_1^2}{50}$, respectively.\n\n3. For part (c), we know the system is in state $\\psi_1$ after the first measurement. We've already computed the expansion of $\\psi_1$ in the $\\phi_i$ basis earlier: $\\psi_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{50}}\\phi_1+\\sqrt{\\frac{16}{50}}\\phi_2$.\n\nThe probability of getting $a_1$ on measuring $A$ again is simply the squared magnitude of the coefficient of $\\phi_1$, which is $\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{50}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{50}$.\n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{(b):\\;} &\\begin{cases}\n\\text{Outcome } b_1:\\; p = \\dfrac{9\\alpha_1^2+16\\beta_1^2}{50} \\\\\n\\text{Outcome } b_2:\\; p = \\dfrac{16\\alpha_1^2+9\\beta_1^2}{50}\n\\end{cases}\\\\\n~\\\\\n\\text{(c):\\;} &\\dfrac{9}{50}\n\\end{align*}\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{(b) P(b_1) = }\\dfrac{9\\alpha_1^2+16\\beta_1^2}{50}\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\text{or}\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; \\text{P(b_2) = }\\dfrac{16\\alpha_1^2+9\\beta_1^2}{50} \\\\ ~\\\\\n\\text{(c) }\\dfrac{9}{50}\n\\end{array}}\\]"}

The strategy is to choose a suitable trial wavefunction and then minimize the expectation value of the Hamiltonian with respect to this function.\n\nThe trial function we consider is $\\psi_{trial}(x) = x^pe^{-ax}$ for $x>0$, and 0 otherwise, where $a$ is a positive constant. We now justify the choice of this function:\nFor the given potential, we know that as $x$ becomes large, $V(x)$ grows linearly. Meanwhile, the trial function decreases exponentially for large $x$ and is zero for negative $x$. This behavior mimics the general shape of the true ground state waveform, which would have most of its probability density concentrated near the origin, decreasing rapidly as we move rightward, while being exactly zero on the negative half of the $x-$axis. The power term $x^p$ allows us some flexibility to adjust the rate of growth near the origin, which will help us optimize our energy estimation.  \n\nWith the trial function chosen, the next step is to calculate the expectation value of the kinetic energy operator, $\\hat T$, and the potential energy operator, $\\hat V$, using the trial function. The expectation value of the kinetic energy is straightforward:\n$$\\langle T \\rangle = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\left(\\frac{d\\psi_{trial}}{dx}\\right)^2 dx.$$\n\nUsing the trial function mentioned earlier, this integral can be evaluated, yielding\n$$\\langle T \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2ap^{2}\\Gamma(p+1)}{2m~a^2},$$\nwhere $\\Gamma$ is the gamma function.\n\nDealing with the potential energy requires determining the constant $C$ in the problem. Let's assume it has a value such that the total energy of the system, including both kinetic and potential contributions, equals $E$. With this notation, we have expressed the constant $C$ in terms of the total energy: $C= \\frac{2E}{x}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the potential energy expression gives:\n$$\\langle V \\rangle = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{Ex}{x^2}|\\psi_{trial}|^2 dx = E\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{|\\psi_{trial}|^2}{x} dx.$$\n\nThis integral convenietly simplifies to $E$, hence the expectation value of the potential energy turns out to be equal to the total energy, $E$.\n \nThe total energy is thus given by $\\langle E \\rangle = \\langle T \\rangle + \\langle V \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2ap^{2}\\Gamma(p+1)}{2m} + E$. \n\nAt this stage, we realize that for any $p$, the kinetic energy term is positively definite, whereas the potential energy term is independent of $p$. Therefore, the minimum energy occurs for the smallest possible value of $p$, which is simply $p=1$. Lowering $p$ further would make the function vanish too quickly near the origin, resulting in a higher expected energy. So, the optimized trial function for the ground state is $\\psi_{trial}(x) = xe^{-ax}$ for $x > 0$. \n\nApplying the variational principle, we obtain an estimate of the ground state energy:\n$$\\boxed{E \\geq \\frac{\\hbar^2a}{2m}}. $$\n\n **Part (b):**\nThe Variational Theorem can be applied to the first excited state if there exists a trial function that has an energy greater than the true energy of the first excited state. \n\nThe trial function proposed for the ground state of the harmonic oscillator is $\\phi_0(x) = a^2 - x^2$, for $|x|<a$, and 0 otherwise. This function is symmetric about the origin and vanishes at the points where the oscillator potential energy diverges, ensuring squared integrals are finite. Additionally, it captures the quadratic behavior near the minimum of the potential. \n\nNow, let's examine the function $\\phi_1(x) = x \\phi_0(x)$. This function satisfies the requirements of a trial function for the first excited state because:\n- It vanishes at the classical turning points ($x=\\pm a$) of the potential, which ensures that the square integrability criterion is met for the excited state.\n- It has one node, corresponding to the first excited state.\n- It matches the oscillatory behavior of the true wavefunction for the first excited state near the potential minimum. \n\nHowever, the appropriateness of this trial function relies heavily on the symmetry of the harmonic oscillator potential. The oscillator's potential energy term encourages symmetry in the wavefunctions, making $\\phi_1(x)$ a reasonable guess. \n\nUnfortunately, the direct application of the variational method with this function won't yield an accurate estimate of the energy, due to the complicated form of the expectation value of the potential energy. To tackle this issue, we'd have to expand the potential energy expression up to quartic terms in $x$, making the calculation more involved.\n\nIn summary, while $\\phi_1(x)$ seems like a decent qualitative approximation of the first excited state waveform, a simpler analysis using the variational method would benefit from a different trial function, one that retains the essential features of the potential but is more amenable to mathematical manipulation.\n$$\\boxed{}$$"}
