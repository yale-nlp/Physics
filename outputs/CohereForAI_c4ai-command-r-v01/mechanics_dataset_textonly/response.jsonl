We need to find its moment of inertia about the center of mass, which is located at $\\frac{l}{2}$. \n\nThe moment of inertia about the center of mass is given by the integral:\n$$I = \\int_{0}^{l} x^2 dm = \\int_{0}^{l} x^2 \\cdot dx \\cdot M/l = \\frac{M}{l}\\int_{0}^{l} x^2dx.$$\n\nEvaluating the integral gives us:\n$$I = \\frac{Ml^2}{3} \\implies I_{\\text{com}} = \\frac{ml^2}{12},$$where we've halved the mass moment arm ($l/2$) to get the moment of inertia about the center of mass.\n\n(b) Lagrangian Formulation:\nWe'll use Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$ with the origin at the pivot point and the $x$-axis along the initial position of the rod.

Initially, the system is at rest, which means both masses are stationary. When the impulse is applied to $m_1$, it experiences a change in velocity, which we can represent as:\n$\\Delta v = \\frac{I}{m_1}$. \n\nUsing Newton's third law, the same force applied to $m_1$ is reacted equally and oppositely on $m_2$.

The coin's linear velocity can be written in polar coordinates as:\n$$\nv = V\\hat{\\boldsymbol{r}} = Vr\\,e^{i}\\,,\n$$\nwhere $V$ is the magnitude and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{r}}$ is the unit radial vector, and $e^{i}$ is the complex exponential, i.e., $e^{i}=\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta$, with $\\theta=0$ initially.\n\nFrom the rotational dynamics, the centripetal acceleration experienced by the coin is given by:\n$$\na=-r\\omega^2 e^{i}\\,.\n$$\nEquating the tangential components of the above equations, we get the angular speed of the coin $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}=\\frac{V}{r}$ and hence the angular position of the coin is given by:\n$$\n\\theta(t)=\\frac{Vt}{r}\\,.\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Parabola Equation\n\nNow, in the small time interval $(0,\\,t]$, the angular displacement $\\theta(t)$ is related to the actual angle turned by the disc by $\\theta(t)\\approx\\omega t$.

One method is to measure the acceleration due to gravity $g$ at different locations on Earth's surface and also measure the local radius of the Earth beneath you. Knowing that the force of gravity between two objects is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers ($F = G\\frac{m1\\cdot m2}{r^2}$ is the formula for gravitational force $F$ acting between two bodies with masses $m1$, $m2$ and a distance $r$ between them), we can calculate the mass of the Earth ($M_E$) with the equation: \n$$g=G\\frac{M_E}{R^2}$$\nwhere $G$ is the universal gravitational constant and $R$ is the radius of the Earth. \n\nWe can measure $g$ using sensitive gravimeters and know the value of $G$ accurately. By measuring $g$ at two different points having some height difference $\\Delta h$, we can solve for Earth's radius in the equation: \n$\\Delta g/g=\\frac{2}{R}\\Delta h$. Once we have a good estimate of the radius, we can substitute it into the first equation to compute the mass. \n\nAnother approach is through satellite measurements. Satellites orbiting Earth experience a force of gravity directed toward the Earth's center. The satellite's orbital period and its distance from Earth can be used to calculate the mass of Earth. The TIDE mission uses lasers to track the LAGEOS satellites orbiting Earth to gather data for this very purpose. \n\n(b) Determining the mass of the Moon (M_M) can be achieved through similar principles as outlined above for Earth but with some added complexities due to the Moon's presence within Earth's sphere of influence. However, the total gravitational pull on Earth from the Moon and Sun provides measurable tidal effects which we can exploit. The most famous experiment is perhaps the lunar laser ranging, where precise measurements of the distance to the Moon are made possible by reflecting lasers off mirrors left on the lunar surface by Apollo astronauts. \n\nThe Earth-Moon system is effectively a large pendulum, and the Moon's gravitational tug causes ocean tides on Earth. By analyzing the tidal patterns, one can infer the Moon's mass. Additionally, the changes in the Moon's orbit over time due to tidal interactions between these celestial bodies provide another avenue for estimation. \n\n(c) To find the distance to the Sun, or heliodistance, one can utilize astronomical observations of the angular diameter of the Sun coupled with the known size of solar disk. This gives us one means of determining the distance fairly directly. Another approach takes advantage of the transit of Venus across the Sun's face, which happens twice every century. The exact alignment required for such an event makes these transits rare but valuable when they occur since the duration of the transit and Earth's circularization speed yield the Sun's apparent size and hence the distance. \n\nYet another method employs radar signals sent towards the Sun and measuring the round-trip travel time. Using radio dishes like those at the Arecibo Observatory, astronomers bounce powerful radio waves off the Sun and carefully measure the delay in the echo's return. \n\nSo in summary, these three key parameters can be extracted using:\n- Gravitational measurements combined with geospatial positioning for Earth's mass.\n- Tidal actions and reactions governing the Earth-Moon system for Moon's mass. \n- Astronomical observations, both visual and radio, for the Sun-Earth distance. \n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\boxed{\\text{(a)} M_\\text{E}:~\\text{Gravitational experiments, } g,\\ R \\\\\n&\\quad \\text{and Satellite orbits}}\\\\\n&\\boxed{\\text{(b)} M_\\text{M}:~\\text{Tidal effects, Lunar laser ranging, Orbital variations}}\\\\\n&\\boxed{\\text{(c)} ~R_\\text{ES}:~\\text{Astronomical observations, Transit timing, Radar tracking}}\n\\end{align*}"}

The time taken to reach the moon is given by:\n$$t = \\frac{R}{V_f}$$\nwhere $V_f$ is the particle's velocity after it reaches the moon's atmosphere. For now, let's assume $V_f = V_{\\text{esc}}$, as the escape velocity is the minimum speed required to leave the moon's gravitational influence. \n\nUsing the relationship between distance, velocity, and time, we get:\n$$b = V_f t = V_{\\text{esc}} \\cdot \\frac{R}{V_f} \\implies V_f^2 = \\frac{b \\cdot V_{\\text{esc}}} {R} $$\n\nPlugging back into our inequality:\n$$d+R > b \\quad \\implies d + R > \\sqrt{\\frac{b \\cdot V_{\\text{esc}}}{R}}$$\nThis equation must be satisfied for the particle to hit the moon. \n\nNow, we can find the smallest impact parameter $b$ for which impact occurs.

This means the impact parameter needed for a hit becomes smaller, leading to a smaller cross-section: $\\sigma \\propto \\frac{1}{V_0^2}$.\n\nii) As $V_0 \\to \\infty$: The incident particles have much higher velocities than the escape velocity, so they easily hit the moon. Thus, $\\sigma$ would approach a constant value independent of $V_0$, namely $\\sigma \\approx \\pi R^2$.\n\nTherefore, the cross section for particles hitting the moon is:\n$$\\sigma = \\pi \\left(\\frac{R \\cdot V_{\\text{esc}}}{\\sqrt{V_0^2 + V_{\\text{esc}}^2}}\\right)^2 \\,\\,\\, .$$\n\nIn [Latex]:\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\boxed{\\sigma = \\pi \\left(\\frac{R \\, V_{\\text{esc}}}{\\sqrt{V_0^2 + V_{\\text{esc}}^2}}\\right)^2}\\,.\n\\end{equation*}"}

The smaller object will be treated as a point particle due to its much smaller size.\n2. **Apply Physics Principles**: We'll use conservation of momentum and energy to find the scattered angles. \nSince we're dealing with spherical objects, the incident angle will be equal to the scattered angle, which is a basic characteristic of central collisions. \n3. **Calculate Cross Section**: The differential cross section d$\\sigma$ can be related to the area that represents the range of angles for the scattered particles. This area will be determined by the impact parameter - the minimum distance between the centers of the two balls.\n \nLet's start with the first two, keeping things as general as possible so we can integrate over all angles later when finding the total cross section.\n\n**Step 1 & 2:**\nConsider a situation where the smaller marble approaches the larger one with velocity $\\vec{v}_{in}$ along the x-axis. According to the principle of conservation of momentum:\n$$\\vec{p}_{initial} = \\vec{p}_{final} \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, \\implies \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, m\\cdot \\vec{v}_{in} = m'\\cdot \\vec{v}'_f + M\\cdot \\vec{V}_f$$\nHere, $\\vec{v}'_f$ is the velocity of the smaller marble after collision and $\\vec{V}_f$ is the velocity of the larger ball. Since the initial y-components of momentum are conserved, we have:\n$mv_{in,y}=m'v'_{f,y}+MV_{f,y}\\,$, which implies that $V_{f,y}=0$, meaning the large ball doesn't move vertically.\n\nSimilarly, energy must also be conserved:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}mv^2_{in}+\\frac{1}{2}Mv^2_i=\\frac{1}{2}m{v'}^{\\,2}_f+\\frac{1::}{{2}}MV^2_f$$\nWith $v_{in}=v'_f$ (since both are just the speed of the smaller marble), this simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}Mv^2_i=\\frac{1}{2}M(V^2_f+\\frac{{v'}^{\\,2}_f){\\sin^2(\\theta})}{1-\\cos(\\theta)})$$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the scattering angle in the horizontal direction. Solving for $V_f$:\n$$V_f=\\sqrt{\\frac{v'^2_f\\,\\sin^2(\\theta)}{1-\\cos(\\theta)}-v^2_i}$$\nNow, since the maximum value of $\\cos(\\theta)$ is 1 and the minimum is $-\\frac{1}{2}$ (for a 90-degree scatter), we find the maximum and minimum values of $V_f$:\n$$V^{max}_f=\\sqrt{\\frac{v^2_f}{4}}=\\frac{v_f}{2}$$\n$$V^{min}_f=\\sqrt{v^2_i+v^2_f}$$\nThese represent the velocities of the large ball when the scatter angle $\\theta$ is 90 degrees (most likely) and 180 degrees (least likely).\n\n**Step 3:** Now, let's find the relationship between the impact parameter $b$ and the scatter angle $\\theta$. Consider the smallest possible impact parameter, $b=R+r$. At this point, the outgoing marble just grazes the surface of the big sphere, meaning the angle $\\theta=90^\\circ$.

As objects approached the speed of light, inconsistencies and contradictions emerged from experiments using Newton's laws of motion. STR was developed to address these anomalies and provide a consistent framework. \n\nThe main contradiction was based on the behavior of light itself: If two observers move at high speeds relative to each other, then according to classical physics, they would measure different values for the speed of light. This contradicted the fundamental idea that the speed of light should be constant for all observers. \n\n(b) An earlier theory that might have obviated the need for STR is the hypothesis that the speed of light decreases with increasing velocity, such that the faster an object moves, the slower its measured speed of light. This would've aligned with classical physics. \n\nThe experiment that disproved this theory was the famous Michelson-Morley Experiment, conducted in 1887. It attempted to measure changes in the speed of light when observing a beam of light traveling against the direction of the Earth's motion around the sun. The results showed no change in the speed of light, indicating that it indeed behaves differently than classical theories predicted. \n\n(c) A modern experiment that supports STR is the OPERA Collaboration's measurement of neutrino speeds in 2011. They observed neutrinos traveling over 300 kilometers away between two underground laboratories in Italy and France. The experiment measured the neutrinos' speed relative to the speed of light and found it to be extremely close to the theoretical maximum, thus aligning with the postulates of STR. \n\nThis result supported the constancy of the speed of light and validated the central tenet of relativity, demonstrating that the speed of light is independent of the observer's velocity. \n\nTherefore, the development of STR was essential to resolve the discrepancies in understanding light's behavior at high velocities, and experimental evidence has continued to validate its principles. \n\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\boxed{\\text{Special Relativity}\\,\\,\\,\\text{was necessary due to inconsistencies at near-light speeds}\\,\\,\\,\\text{and}\\,\\,\\,\\text{experiments like OPERA support its core tenets}.}\n\\end{equation*}"}

Gravity acts only in the negative y direction $g=-g\\hat{j}$. \n\nThe forces acting on each object are as follows:\n1. $m_1$: Gravitational force $F_g = m_1\\cdot g\\,\\hat{j}$ pulling downward, and tension $T\\hat{u}$ from the string, where $\\hat{u}$ is along the incline.\n2. $m_2$: Tension $T\\hat{u}$ pulling upward.\n3.

A natural choice would be to pick the displacement of each pendulum as our coords, but the spring displacement is more suitable here due to the nature of the forces involved. Therefore our general coordinates are: \n$$q_1 = x - l \\quad \\text{displacement of the left bob} $$\n$$q_2 = y - l \\quad \\text{displacement of the right bob} $$\nwhere $x$ and $y$ are the positions of the bobs. Note that these are spatial coordinates, not angular positions often used for simple pendula. These coordinates directly describe the spring displacement from its equilibrium. \n\nVelocities:\n$$\\dot q_1 = \\frac{dx}{dt} = v_x \\quad \\text{velocity of the left bob}$$\n$$\\dot q_2 = \\frac{dy}{dt} = v_y \\quad \\text{velocity of the right bob}$$\n\nStep 2:\nWe need to find the potential energy $V$ and kinetic energy $T$ of the system.  \nThe potential energy stored in the spring is simply half of the spring potential energy:\n$$V = \\frac{1}{2} k\\left(\\sqrt{(x-y)^2 + l^2} - l\\right)^2$$\nNote that we've subtracted the potential energy associated with the equilibrium position.  \n\nThe kinetic energy is just the sum of the two Bob's individual kinetic energies:\n$$T = \\frac{1}{2} m (\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2)$$\n\nPutting it together, the Lagrangian is:\n\\begin{align*}\n    L &= T - V \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{2} m (\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2) - \\frac{1}{2} k\\left(\\sqrt{(x-y)^2 + l^2} - l\\right)^2\n\\end{align*}\nSubstituting our chosen general coordinates and velocities:\n\\begin{equation*}\n    L = \\frac{1}{2} m (v_x^2 + v_y^2) - \\frac{1}{2} k\\left(\\sqrt{(q_1+q_2)^2 + l^2} - l\\right)^2\n\\end{equation*}\nThis is the exact Lagrangian of the system. \n\nStep 3: To find the normal modes and natural frequencies, we'll assume small oscillations around the equilibrium, i.e., $q_i << l$. Expanding the square root term up to quadratic order gives:\n$$L = \\frac{1}{2} m (v_x^2 + v_y^2) - \\frac{1}{2} k \\left(q_1^2 + 2q_1 q_2 + q_2^2 \\right) + \\mathcal{O}(q^3)$$\nThe linearized Lagrangian is now quadratic in the coordinates, which means our normal modes are harmonic oscillators. The normal coordinates are simply displacements from equilibrium along the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of $q_1$ and $q_2$:\n$$Q_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left(q_1 + q_2\\right) \\quad \\text{symmetric mode}\\\\\nQ_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left(q_1 - q_2\\right) \\quad \\text{antisymmetric mode}$$\nThe corresponding frequencies are those of identical harmonic oscillators:\n$$\\omega_{1,2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$$\nSo the normal modes of vibration are simple harmonics with frequencies $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ for the symmetric and antisymmetric modes, respectively.\n\nStep 4:\nFor the last part, let's determine what happens when an impulse is given to the left bob, say a horizontal kick of magnitude $v$ to the right. We're interested in the subsequent motion in terms of our normal modes.  \nAt time zero, only the left bob moves, so the initial conditions are:\n$$Q_1(0) = \\frac{l}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\quad \\dot Q_1(0) = \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\quad Q_2(0) = \\dot Q_2(0) = 0.$$\nThe solution to the equations of motion for our normal modes, with the above ICs, is:\n$$Q_1(t) = \\frac{l}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cos(\\omega_1 t) + \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{2}\\omega_1}\\sin(\\omega_1 t)$$\n$$Q_2(t) = \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{2}\\omega_2}\\sin(\\omega_2 t)$$\nThese represent the motions along the symmetric and anti-symmetric modes. Interestingly, while the symmetric mode has a non-zero initial amplitude due to the impulse, the antisymmetric mode starts purely from the impulse and maintains a pure oscillatory behavior.\n\nThe full coordinate motions for the bobs are found by transforming back from normal modes:\n\\begin{align*}\nq_1 &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left[ \\left(Q_1+\\frac{l}{2}\\right)\\cos(\\omega_1 t) + \\frac{1}{2}Q_2\\left(\\cos(\\omega_1 t)-\\cos(\\omega_2 t)\\right) + \\frac{v}{\\omega_1}\\sin(\\omega_1 t) \\right] \\\\\nq_2 &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left[ \\left(Q_1-\\frac{l}{2}\\right)\\cos(\\omega_1 t) - \\frac{1}{2}Q_2\\left(\\cos(\\omega_1 t)+\\cos(\\omega_2 t)\\right) \\right]\n\\end{align*}\nwith the initial conditions as stated earlier.\n\n\nThe motion of the system in terms of the normal coordinates is hence given by:\n\\begin{align*}\nQ_1(t) &= \\frac{l}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cos(\\omega_1 t) + \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{2}\\omega_1}\\sin(\\omega_1 t) & \\text{Symmetric Mode} \\\\\nQ_2(t) &= \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{2}\\omega_2}\\sin(\\omega_2 t) & \\text{Anti-Symmetric Mode}\n\\end{align*}\n \nTherefore, the complete solution is given in the following concise form:\n\\[\\boxed{\\begin{aligned}\nQ_1(t) &= \\frac{l}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cos\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}t\\right) + \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{2}\\cdot\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}}\\sin\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}t\\right) \\\\\nQ_2(t) &= \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{2}\\cdot\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}} \\sin\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}t\\right)\n\\end{aligned}}\\]"}

We're told that the two forces are equal at maximum compression, so setting them equal:\n$$-kx = mg \\implies x = \\frac{mg}{k}$$\nWe can solve for the deceleration using Newton's second law, knowing that the force of air resistance has become negligible:\n$$a = -\\frac{F}{m} = -\\frac{-kx}{m} - \\frac{gm}{x} = -\\frac{g}{\\left(\\frac{mg}{k}\\right)} - gm\\frac{k}{mg} = -\\frac{k+g}{mg}mg = -\\left(1+\\frac{g}{k}\\right)g$$\nSetting this equal to $-10g$, we solve for $x$:\n$$x = \\frac{10mg - g}{k} = \\frac{9g}{k} \\approx \\boxed{0.135\\,\\text{meters}}$$\n\nd) The assumption that air resistance is directly proportional to speed seems to hold reasonably well for most objects in freefall through the atmosphere, especially at high speeds. This is because air resistance primarily depends on the object's cross-sectional area and the density of the fluid (air) -- as an object falls faster, more air molecules collide with it, leading to a roughly linear increase in resistive force. However, at low speeds, this simple proportionality breaks down, as other factors such as the shape of the falling object and viscosity come into play. So while it's a good approximation for our scenario, it's not entirely accurate across all speed ranges. \n\nThe answers are:\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\boxed{2.4\\,\\text{s}} \\\\\n&\\boxed{8\\,\\text{seconds}} \\\\\n&\\boxed{0.135\\,\\text{m}} \\\\\n&\\checkmark\\,\\,\\text{(qualitatively reasonable)}\n\\end{align*}"}

Object dropped into Tunnel 1 (along the rotation axis):\nSince the object is dropped along the axis of rotation, it will experience no net force due to the Earth's rotation.

The period of this oscillation is given by:\n$T_1 = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{r}{g}}$, where r is the radius of the Earth and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\n2. Object dropped into Tunnel 2 (equatorial tunnel):\nThe object inside the equatorial tunnel experiences a \"centrifugal\" force due to the Earth's rotation, acting outward along the tunnel.

As the object moves radially inward, the Earth's rotation sweeps out angular distance, effectively transporting the object around the Earth. To find the period here, we need to consider the combination of radial and angular motion.

Here's the summary in LateX:\n\n\\[\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\nR &\\propto L^{1/3} \\\\\nT &\\sim L^{3/2} \\\\\n\\delta(t) &= -\\frac{R^3}{3b}v^2 = \\frac{R\\dot{\\phi}}{\\sqrt{3b}}\\sin{\\left(\\frac{GM}{R^3}t\\right)} \\\\\n\\phi(t) &\\approx \\frac{1}{R\\sqrt{3b}}\\cdot \\frac{-\\cos{\\left(\\frac{GM}{R^3} t\\right)}+\\cos{\\left(\\frac{GM}{R^3} t_0\\right)}}{\\left(\\frac{GM}{R^3}\\right)^2}+\\gamma\n\\end{aligned}\n}\\]"}
